To do so, we advance the notion of sociomathematical norms, that is, normative aspects of mathematical discussions that are specific to students' mathematical activity. The explication of sociomathematical norms extends our previous work on general classroom social norms that sustain inquiry-based discussion and argumentation. Episodes from a second-grade classroom where mathematics instruction generally followed an inquiry tradition are used to clarify the processes by which sociomathematical norms are interactively constituted and to illustrate how these norms regulate mathematical argumentation and influence learning opportunities for both the students and the teacher. In doing so, we both clarify how students develop a mathematical disposition and account for students' development of increasing intellectual autonomy in mathematics. In the process, the teacher's role as a representative of the mathematical community is elaborated.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344474293

In the study, a combined ontological-psychological outlook is applied. An analysis of different mathematical definitions and representations brings us to the conclusion that abstract notions, such as number or function, can be conceived in two fundamentally different ways: structurally-as objects, and operationally-as processes. These two approaches, although ostensibly incompatible, are in fact complementary. It will be shown that the processes of learning and of problem-solving consist in an intricate interplay between operational and structural conceptions of the same notions. On the grounds of historical examples and in the light of cognitive schema theory we conjecture that the operational conception is, for most people, the first step in the acquisition of new mathematical notions. Thorough analysis of the stages in concept formation leads us to the conclusion that transition from computational operations to abstract objects is a long and inherently difficult process, accomplished in three steps: interiorization, condensation, and reification. In this paper, special attention is given to the complex phenomenon of reification, which seems inherently so difficult that at certain levels it may remain practically out of reach for certain students. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002546637

Over the 4 years, there were fundamental changes in the beliefs and instruction of 18 teachers such that the teachers' role evolved from demonstrating procedures to helping children build on their mathematical thinking by engaging them in a variety of problem-solving situations and encouraging them to talk about their mathematical thinking. Changes in the instruction of individual teachers were directly related to changes in their students' achievement. For every teacher, class achievement in concepts and problem solving was higher at the end of the study than at the beginning. In spite of the shift in emphasis from skills to concepts and problem solving, there was no overall change in computational performance.

(2) The unit-step function in the t-domain is transformed to unity in the u-domain. (3) Scaling of the function f(t) in the t-domain is equivalent to scaling of F(u) in the u-domain by the same scale factor.

In addition, sex differences in achievement, interest, and course selection were analyzed. At the end of Grade 10, students opted for either a basic or an advanced mathematics course. Data analyses revealed sex differences in favor of boys in mathematics achievement, interest, and opting for an advanced mathematics course. Further analyses by means of structural equation modeling show that interest had no significant effect on learning from Grade 7 to Grade 10, but did affect course selection - that is, highly interested students were more likely to choose an advanced course. Furthermore, interest at the end of Grade 10 had a direct and an indirect effect (via course selection) on achievement in upper secondary school. In addition, results suggest that, at least from Grade 7 to Grade 10, achievement affected interest - that is, high achievers expressed more interest than low achievers. The findings underline the importance of interest for academic choices and for self-regulated learning when the instructional setting is less structured.","Achievement; Gender issues; Longitudinal studies; Motivation; Secondary mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035565349

This new model inverts or 'flips' the usual classroom paradigm, in that students learn initial course concepts outside of the classroom, while class time is reserved for more active problem-based learning and practice activities. While the flipped classroom model shows promise for improving STEM learning and increasing student interest in STEM fields, discussions to date of the model and its impact are more anecdotal than data driven - very little research has been undertaken to rigorously assess the potential effects on student learning that can result from the flipped classroom environment. This study involved 55 students in 2 sections of an applied linear algebra course, using the traditional lecture format in one section and the flipped classroom model in another. In the latter, students were expected to prepare for the class in some way, such as watching screencasts prepared by the instructor, or reading the textbook or the instructor's notes. Student content understanding and course perceptions were examined. Content understanding was measured by the performance on course exams, and students in the flipped classroom environment had a more significant increase between the sequential exams compared to the students in the traditional lecture section, while performing similarly in the final exam. Course perceptions were represented by an end-of-semester survey that indicated that the flipped classroom students were very positive about their experience in the course, and particularly appreciated the student collaboration and instructional video components. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","flipped classroom; inquiry-based learning; linear algebra; student perceptions of instruction; teaching with technology",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894279223

Two questions were addressed: What can preservice teachers learn from the analysis of videotaped lessons? How can preservice teachers' analysis ability, and its improvement, be measured? Two groups of preservice teachers (approximately 140 in total) participated in the program. A three-step lesson analysis framework was applied to three lesson videos: (1) Goal(s) and parts of the lesson; (2) student learning; and, (3) teaching alternatives. Preservice teachers' ability to analyze lessons was measured through an open-ended pre- and post-assessment. In the assessment, preservice teachers were asked to mark and comment on events (in a lesson not included in the program) that they found interesting for: Teachers' actions/decisions; students' behavior/learning; and, mathematical content. A coding system was developed based on five criteria: elaboration, mathematics content, student learning, critical approach, and alternative strategies.

It also reports on an investigation of high-performing 2nd-semester calculus students' ability to reason about covarying quantities in dynamic situations. The study revealed that these students were able to construct images of a function's dependent variable changing in tandem with the imagined change of the independent variable, and in some situations, were able to construct images of rate of change for contiguous intervals of a function's domain. However, students appeared to have difficulty forming images of continuously changing rate and could not accurately represent or interpret inflection points or increasing and decreasing rate for dynamic function situations. These findings suggest that curriculum and instruction should place increased emphasis on moving students from a coordinated image of two variables changing in tandem to a coordinated image of the instantaneous rate of change with continuous changes in the independent variable for dynamic function situations.","Applications; Calculus; Cognitive development; College mathematics; Functions; Mathematical modeling; Reasoning",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036860479

Over the past decade, policymakers have funded a range of professional development efforts designed to address this need. However, there has been little success in determining whether and when teachers develop mathematical knowledge from professional development, and if so, what features of professional development contribute to such teacher learning. This was due, in part, to a lack of measures of teachers' content knowledge for teaching mathematics. This article attempts to fill these gaps. In it we describe an effort to evaluate California's Mathematics Professional Development Institutes (MPDIs) using novel measures of knowledge for teaching mathematics.

What one actually sees in them depends on the requirements of the problem to which they are applied. Not less important, it depends on what one is able to perceive and prepared to notice. It is this last statement which becomes the leading theme of this article. The main focus is on the versatility and adaptability of student's algebraic knowledge. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the theory of reification according to which there is an inherent process-object duality in the majority of mathematical concepts. It is the basic tenet of our theory that the operational (process-oriented) conception emerges first and that the mathematical objects (structural conceptions) develop afterward through reification of the processes. There is much evidence showing that reification is difficult to achieve. The nature and the growth of algebraic thinking is first analyzed from an epistemological perspective supported by historical observations. Eventually, its development is presented as a sequence of ever more advanced transitions from operational to structural outlook. This model is subsequently applied to the individual learning. The focus is on two crucial transitions: from the purely operational algebra to the structural algebra 'of a fixed value' (of an unknown) and then from here to the functional algebra (of a variable). The special difficulties experienced by the learner at both these junctions are illustrated with much empirical data coming from a broad range of sources. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24944477378

An inductive analysis of the data revealed three major sources of the students' difficulties: (a) concept understanding, (b) mathematical language and notation, and (c) getting started on a proof. Also, the students' perceptions of mathematics and proof influenced their proof writing. Their difficulties with concept understanding are discussed in terms of a concept-understanding scheme involving concept definitions, concept images, and concept usage.

This article focuses on middle school students' understanding of the equal sign and its relation to performance solving algebraic equations. The data indicate that many students lack a sophisticated understanding of the equal sign and that their understanding of the equal sign is associated with performance on equation-solving items. Moreover, the latter finding holds even when controlling for mathematics ability (as measured by standardized achievement test scores).

STEM PBL has been a critical challenge to be embedded in schools, thus the effect of STEM PBL should to be examined. Teachers in 3 high schools attended sustained professional developments provided by 1 STEM center based in a Southwestern university and were required to implement STEM PBLs once in every 6 weeks for 3 years (2008 through 2010). The participants were 836 high school students in these 3 schools who took the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test and had scores at least in the initial year. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the data using student’s mathematics TAKS scores and demographic information for the longitudinal study. STEM PBL instruction influenced student achievement in mathematics by both student demographic backgrounds and performance levels. Low performing students showed statistically significantly higher growth rates on mathematics scores than high and middle performing students over the 3 years. In addition, student’s ethnicity and economic status were good predictors of academic achievement.

In RME, context problems are intended for supporting a reinvention process that enables students to come to grips with formal mathematics. This approach is primarily described from an instructional-design perspective. The instructional designer tries to construe a route by which the conventional mathematics can be reinvented. Such a reinvention route will be paved with context problems that offer the students opportunities for progressive math-ematizing. Context problems are defined as problems of which the problem situation is experientially real to the student. An RME design for a calculus course is taken as an example, to illustrate that the theory based on the design heuristic using context problems and modeling, which was developed for primary school mathematics, also fits an advanced topic such as calculus. Special attention is given to the RME heuristic that refer to the role models can play in a shift from a model of situated activity to a model for mathematical reasoning. In light of this model-of/model-for shift, it is argued that discrete functions and their graphs play a key role as an intermediary between the context problems that have to be solved and the formal calculus that is developed. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843074629

The theoretical model includes four lesson study features (investigation, planning, research lesson, and reflection) and three pathways through which lesson study improves instruction: changes in teachers' knowledge and beliefs; changes in professional community; and changes in teaching - learning resources. The model thus suggests that development of teachers' knowledge and professional community (not just improved lesson plans) are instructional improvement mechanisms within lesson study. The theoretical model is used to examine the ""auditable trail"" of data from a North American lesson study case, yielding evidence that the lesson study work affected each of the three pathways.

In this paper, after taking a close look at two episodes that give rise to a number of difficult questions, I propose to base research on a metaphor of thinking-as-communicating. This conceptualization entails viewing learning mathematics as an initiation to a certain well defined discourse. Mathematical discourse is made special by two main factors: first, by its exceptional reliance on symbolic artifacts as its communication-mediating tools, and second, by the particular meta-rules that regulate this type of communication. The meta-rules are the observer's construct and they usually remain tacit for the participants of the discourse. In this paper I argue that by eliciting these special elements of mathematical communication, one has a better chance of accounting for at least some of the still puzzling phenomena. To show how it works, I revisit the episodes presented at the beginning of the paper, reformulate the ensuing questions in the language of thinking-ascommunication, and re-address the old quandaries with the help of special analytic tools that help in combining analysis of mathematical content of classroom interaction with attention to meta-level concerns of the participants. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010503968

Findings revealed that teachers had orientations toward using curriculum materials that influenced the way they used them regardless of whether they agree with the mathematical vision within the materials. As a result, different uses of the curriculum led to different opportunities for student and teacher learning. Inexperienced teachers were most likely to take a piloting stance toward the curriculum and engage all of its resources fully.

Drawing on analyses of discourse from videotaped classroom sessions, this paper documents the ways that agency and accountability were distributed in the classrooms through interactions between the teachers and students as they worked on mathematical content. In doing so, we problematize the assumption that competencies are simply attributes of individuals that can be externally defined. Instead, we propose a concept of individual competence as an attribute of a person's participation in an activity system such as a classroom. In this perspective, what counts as ""competent"" gets constructed in particular classrooms, and can therefore look very different from setting to setting. The implications of the ways that competence can be defined are discussed in terms of future research and equitable learning outcomes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Classroom culture; Competence; Discourse analysis; Middle school; Urban schools",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849107550

In interviews, teachers reported having learned about students' mathematical thinking, about the importance of attending to student ideas during instruction, and about their school's mathematics curriculum.

A geometrical sphere, for instance, is an abstract ideal, formally determinable entity, like every genuine concept. At the same time, it possesses figural properties, first of all a certain shape. The ideality, the absolute perfection of a geometrical sphere cannot be found in reality. In this symbiosis between concept and figure, as it is revealed in geometrical entities, it is the image component which stimulates new directions of thought, but there are the logical, conceptual constraints which control the formal rigour of the process. We have called the geometrical figures figural concepts because of their double nature. The paper analyzes the internal tensions which may appear in figural concepts because of this double nature, development aspects and didactical implications. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012156673

Most students do not find their science classes interesting and motivating. These claims are especially valid regarding those students who, in the future, will probably not embark on a career in science or engineering but will need science and technology personally and functionally as literate citizens. One key problem seems to be that few science programs around the world teach how science is linked to those issues that are relevant to students' life, environment, and role as a citizen. As a result, many students are unable to participate in societal discussions about science and its related technological applications. This paper discusses the need to incorporate socioscientific ideas into the science curricula more thoroughly. This recommendation is supported by a theoretical rationale from various sources leading to a reflection about common practices in science education in three countries: Israel, Germany, and the USA.

We present the core of a model for the genesis of abstraction. The principal components of the model are three dynamically nested epistemic actions: constructing, recognizing, and building-with.

The results of this study suggest that teachers recognize the variety of roles that proof plays in mathematics; noticeably absent, however, was a view of proof as a tool for learning mathematics.

Online teaching and learning are an unprecedented experience for most teachers and students; consequently, they have a limited experience with it. This paper examines the views of secondary school mathematics teachers on E-learning implementation barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic at four barrier levels, namely teacher, school, curriculum and student. Furthermore, it assesses the relationship between barrier levels with teachers' demographic background. Data was collected through an online questionnaire, involving 159 participants from lower and upper secondary schools in Indonesia. The findings of this study suggest that student level barrier had the highest impact on e-learning use. In addition, the student level barrier showed strong positive correlation with the school level barrier and curriculum level barrier. The study showed that teachers' backgrounds had no impact on the level of barriers. This study stimulates further discussion on the way to overcome e-learning barriers whilst simultaneously maximizing benefits of E-learning during this pandemic and beyond it by highlighting the importance of students' voices. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Modestum LTD.","Barrier to e-Learning; E-learning during COVID-19; E-learning in Indonesia; E-Learning in mathematics education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085942104

We argue that the nature of situated learning and cognition cannot be fully understood by focusing only on social, cultural and contextual factors. These factors are themselves further situated and made comprehensible by the shared biology and fundamental bodily experiences of human beings. Thus cognition itself is embodied, and the bodily-grounded nature of cognition provides a foundation for social situatedness, entails a reconceptualization of cognition and mathematics itself, and has important consequences for mathematics education. After framing some theoretical notions of embodied cognition in the perspective of modern cognitive science, we analyze a case study - continuity of functions. We use conceptual metaphor theory to show how embodied cognition, while providing grounding for situatedness, also gives fruitful results in analyzing the cognitive difficulties underlying the understanding of continuity. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23144461481

I see an aim of inquiry in teaching to be the 'critical alignment' (Wenger, 1998) of teaching within the communities in which teaching takes place.

Several studies have suggested that one of the main factors contributing to this complexity is that fractions comprise a multifaceted notion encompassing five interrelated subconstructs (i.e., part-whole, ratio, operator, quotient, and measure). Kieren was the first to establish that the concept of fractions is not a single construct, but consists of several interrelated subconstructs. Later on, in the early 1980s, Behr et al. built on Kieren's conceptualization and suggested a theoretical model linking the five subconstructs of fractions to the operations of fractions, fraction equivalence, and problem solving. In the present study we used this theoretical model as a reference point to investigate students' constructions of the different subconstructs of fractions. In particular, using structural equation modeling techniques to analyze data of 646 fifth and sixth graders' performance on fractions, we examined the associations among the different subconstructs of fractions as well as the extent to which these subconstructs explain students' performance on fraction operations and fraction equivalence.

The resulting Multidimensional Problem-Solving Framework has four phases: orientation, planning, executing, and checking. Embedded in the framework are two cycles, each of which includes at least three of the four phases. The framework also characterizes various problem-solving attributes (resources, affect, heuristics, and monitoring) and describes their roles and significance during each of the problem-solving phases. The framework's sub-cycle of conjecture, test, and evaluate (accept/reject) became evident to us as we observed the mathematicians and listened to their running verbal descriptions of how they were imagining a solution, playing out that solution in their minds, and evaluating the validity of the imagined approach. The effectiveness of the mathematicians in making intelligent decisions that led down productive paths appeared to stem from their ability to draw on a large reservoir of well-connected knowledge, heuristics, and facts, as well as their ability to manage their emotional responses. The mathematicians' well-connected conceptual knowledge, in particular, appeared to be an essential attribute for effective decision making and execution throughout the problem-solving process. © Springer 2005.","Affect; Conceptual knowledge; Control; Mathematical behavior; Mathematics practices; Metacognition; Problem solving",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444383058

Although keeping animals contributes to the increase of children's positive attitudes toward wild animals, pet owners show similar negative attitudes toward less popular animals such as insects, bats or rats than non-pet owners. Moreover, some of these animals are emblazoned with various myths (hereafter alternative conceptions) which may have a negative impact on children's attitudes toward them. We used a novel approach with two questionnaires with nearly identical items for identifying attitudes to bats and spiders in a sample of primary school participants (N = 196) aged 10-16 years. Score from each questionnaire was factor analysed and then compared with a pair-wise statistic. Children (especially girls) showed more negative attitudes toward spiders in comparison with bats. Both knowledge and alternative conceptions were distributed randomly irrespective of children's age or gender. We found a moderate, but significant correlation between alternative conceptions and attitudes, whereas more alternative conceptions resulted in more negative attitudes. Interestingly, the link between attitude and knowledge was found just for bats, but not for spiders perhaps due to greater fear from spiders.

While these schemas are developing, children continue to rely primarily on visual matching to distinguish shapes. They are, however, also capable of recognizing components and simple properties of familiar shapes. Thus, evidence supports previous claims (Clements & Battista, 1992b) that a prerecognitive level exists before van Hiele Level 1 (""visual level"") and that Level 1 should be reconceptualized as syncretic (i.e., a synthesis of verbal declarative and imagistic knowledge, each interacting with the other) instead of visual (Clements, 1992).","Cognitive development; Conceptual knowledge; Constructivism; Content knowledge; Early childhood; Geometry; Learning theories",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-22444455355

School mathematics is seen as a combination of visual representations, including geometry and graphs, together with symbolic calculations and manipulations. Pure mathematics in university shifts towards a formal framework of axiomatic systems and mathematical proof. In this paper, the transition in thinking is formulated within a framework of 'three worlds of mathematics'- the 'conceptual-embodied' world based on perception, action and thought experiment, the 'proceptual-symbolic' world of calculation and algebraic manipulation compressing processes such as counting into concepts such as number, and the 'axiomatic-formal' world of set-theoretic concept definitions and mathematical proof. Each 'world' has its own sequence of development and its own forms of proof that may be blended together to give a rich variety of ways of thinking mathematically. This reveals mathematical thinking as a blend of differing knowledge structures; for instance, the real numbers blend together the embodied number line, symbolic decimal arithmetic and the formal theory of a complete ordered field. Theoretical constructs are introduced to describe how genetic structures set before birth enable the development of mathematical thinking, and how experiences that the individual has met before affect their personal growth. These constructs are used to consider how students negotiate the transition from school to university mathematics as embodiment and symbolism are blended with formalism. At a higher level, structure theorems proved in axiomatic theories link back to more sophisticated forms of embodiment and symbolism, revealing the intimate relationship between the three worlds.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349643595

One such conceptualization that shows promise is mathematical knowledge for teaching - mathematical knowledge that is specifically useful in teaching mathematics. While mathematical knowledge for teaching has started to gain attention as an important concept in the mathematics teacher education research community, there is limited understanding of what it is, how one might recognize it, and how it might develop in the minds of teachers.

The conceptual framework was developed in research on mathematics instruction but it is supposed to generalize across subjects. It is based on general theories of schooling and teaching as well as established theories and research traditions from educational psychology. Although used frequently in German-speaking countries, no comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation as well as the existing evidence regarding the framework, including its strengths and weaknesses, exists so far. The present paper therefore presents first an overview of the theoretical rationale of the framework. Second, it gives an overview of differences and commonalities in the operationalizations of the Three Basic Dimensions in different studies, including a comprehensive set of sub-dimensions. Third, evidence on the reliability and validity of the dimensions is reviewed, with good results for reliability and mixed results for predictive validity. Fourth, an analysis of three mathematics lessons using observer ratings illustrates how the framework of the Three Basic Dimensions can be used for investigating instructional quality. Finally, strengths and limitations of the framework for capturing instructional quality are discussed and we elaborate on the framework’s potential for further development. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Classroom management; Cognitive activation; Student support; Teaching quality; Three Basic Dimensions",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048049215

The research draws from Vygotsky's historical-cultural school of psychology, on the one hand, and from Bakhtin and Voloshinov's theory of discourse on the other, and is grounded in a semiotic-cultural theoretical framework in which algebraic thinking is considered as a sign-mediated cognitive praxis. Within this theoretical framework, the students' algebraic activity is investigated in the interaction of the individual's subjectivity and the social means of semiotic objectification. An ethnographic qualitative methodology, supported by historic, epistemological research, ensured the design and interpretation of a set of teaching activities. The paper focuses on the discussion held by a small group of students of which an interpretative, situated discourse analysis is provided.

The aim of the paper is to highlight the importance of structural analysis between argumentation and proof.

Drawing substantially on their experiences in learning mathematics, many teachers are disposed to teach mathematics by ""telling"": by stating facts and demonstrating procedures to their students. Clear and accurate telling provides a foundation for teachers' sense of efficacy - the belief that they can affect student learning - because the direct demonstration of mathematics is taken to be necessary for student learning. A strong sense of efficacy supports teachers' efforts to face difficult challenges and persist in the face of adversity. But current reforms that de-emphasize telling and focus on enabling students' mathematical activity undermine this basis of efficacy. For the current reform to generate deep and lasting changes, teachers must find new foundations for building durable efficacy beliefs that are consistent with reform-based teaching practices. Although productive new ""moorings"" for efficacy exist, research has not examined how practicing teachers' sense of efficacy shifts as they attempt to align their practice with reform principles. Suggestions for research to chart the development of, and change in, mathematics teachers' sense of efficacy are presented.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344444078

We argue that by choosing video clips, posing substantive questions, and facilitating productive conversations, professional developers can guide teachers to examine central aspects of learning and instruction. We draw primarily from our experiences developing and studying two mathematics PD programs, the Problem-Solving Cycle (PSC) and Learning and Teaching Geometry (LTG). While both programs feature classroom video in a central role, they illustrate different approaches to practice-based PD. The PSC, an adaptive model of PD, provides a framework within which facilitators tailor activities to suit their local context. By contrast, LTG is a highly specified model of PD, which details in advance particular learning goals, design characteristics, and extensive support materials for facilitators. We propose a continuum of video use in PD from highly adaptive to highly specified and consider the affordances and constraints of different approaches exemplified by the PSC and LTG programs. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867473323

These key elements are illustrated with empirical examples drawn from a variety of research studies. Scaffolding, thus conceived, brings together several theoretical domains, and by situating metacognition within a framework derived from the social activity of scaffolding, a bridge is formed between the instructional support a teacher might provide and the learner's self-control of the learning process.

Switching from one modality to the other through dragging often allows them to produce fruitful conjectures and to pass from the empirical to the theoretical side of the question.

Interview data showed differences in the quality of students' thinking as they solved order and estimation tasks involving fractions.

We discuss this data from a perspective that extends the notion of concept image to that of statement image and introduces the notion of proof framework to indicate that part of a theorem's image which corresponds to the top-level logical structure of a proof. For simplified informal calculus statements, just 8.5% of unpacking attempts were successful; for actual statements from calculus texts, this dropped to 5%.

The participants were five high school teachers of ninth-grade algebra at different stages in their teaching career. The qualitative analysis of the data revealed that in general beliefs were very influential on the teachers' daily pedagogical decisions and that their beliefs about the nature of mathematics served as a primary source of their beliefs about pedagogy and student learning. Findings from the analysis concur with previous studies in this area that reveal a clear relationship between these constructs. In addition, the results provide useful insights for the mathematics education community as it shows the diversity among the inservice teachers' beliefs (presented as hypothesized belief models), the role and influence of beliefs about the nature of mathematics on the belief structure and how the teachers designed their instructional practices to reflect these beliefs.

It is argued that teachers' beliefs about the teaching and learning mathematics are critical in determining the pace of curriculum reform. Educational change is a complex process in which teachers hold strong beliefs about the quality and the process of innovation. Curriculum implementation may only occur through sufferance as many teachers are suspicious of reform in mathematics education given its equivocal success over the past decades. It is not surprising then that many teachers, when they come to enact the curriculum in their classes, rely more on their own beliefs than on current trends in pedagogy. These beliefs, conservative as they might be, have their own rationality in the practical and daily nature of the teaching profession, and in the compelling influence of educational systems from which these teachers are paradoxically the social product. The literature indicates that many of these teachers hold behaviourist beliefs, a fact that has strong implications for the success of constructivistoriented curriculum reform. In general, studies of teachers' pedagogical beliefs reveal the extreme complexity of bringing about educational change, and largely explains the failure of many past reform endeavours.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548190198

From research on school-based lesson study in Japan and from the research on and experience with lesson study in schools in the US, the authors hypothesize that certain institutional structures and practices are important for maximizing its impact, but are sometimes omitted from lesson study outside of Japan. The authors introduce a new term: collaborative lesson research (CLR), defined to include those structures and practices. A three-phase model of school-based CLR, focused on implementation of the new learning standards for mathematics, is being piloted at 15 urban schools in three major school districts in the US.

We call this a correspondence approach to functions. However, in our work with students we have found that a covariational appraoch is often more powerful, where students working in a problem situation first fill down a table column with x-values, typically by adding 1, then fill down a y-column through an operation they construct within the problem context. Such an approach has the benefit of emphasizing rate-of-change. It also raises the question of what it is that we want to cal 'rate' across different functional situations. We make two initial conjectures, first that a rate can be initially understood as a unit per unit comparison and second that a unit is the invariant relationship between a successor and its predecessor. Based on these conjectures we describe a variety of multiplicative units, then propose three ways of understanding rate of change in relation to exponential functions. Finally we argue that rate is different than ratio and that an integrated understanding of rate is built from multiple concepts. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000028397

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that the more able students planned their problems and were able to work out the answer, while their less able peers had difficulty with both the planning and the solution of their own problems.

However, there are relatively few empirical studies on what takes place during this instruction, why this instruction is used, and how it affects students' learning. In this paper, I investigate these issues by examining a case study of one professor using this type of instruction in an introductory real analysis course. I first describe the professor's actions in the classroom and argue that these actions are the result of the professor's beliefs about mathematics, students, and education, as well as his knowledge of the material being covered. I then illustrate how the professor's teaching style influenced the way that his students attempted to learn the material. Finally, I discuss the implications that the reported data have on mathematics education research. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Research suggests, however, that current instruction is not helping students to develop this idea, and that though many students know, for example, how to compute means or medians, they do not know how to apply or interpret them. Part of the problem may be that the interpretations we often use to introduce data summaries, including viewing averages as typical scores or fair shares, provide a poor conceptual basis for using them to represent the entire group for purposes such as comparing one group to another. To explore the challenges of learning to think about data as signal and noise, we examine the ""signal/noise"" metaphor in the context of three different statistical processes: repeated measures, measuring individuals, and dichotomous events. On the basis of this analysis, we make several recommendations about research and instruction.","Conceptual knowledge; Curriculum; Historical analysis; Reform in mathematics education; Statistics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036638556

In geometry, forms of software usually known as dynamic geometry environments may be useful as they can enable students to interact with geometrical theory. Yet the meanings that students gain of deductive reasoning through experience with such software is likely to be shaped, not only by the tasks they tackle and their interactions with their teacher and with other students, but also by features of the software environment. In order to try to illuminate this latter phenomenon, and to determine the longer-term influence of using such software, this paper reports on data from a longitudinal study of 12-year-old students' interpretations of geometrical objects and relationships when using dynamic geometry software. The focus of the paper is the progressive mathematisation of the student's sense of the software, examining their interpretations and using the explanations that students give of the geometrical properties of various quadrilaterals that they construct as one indicator of this. The research suggests that the students' explanations can evolve from imprecise, 'everyday' expressions, through reasoning that is overtly mediated by the software environment, to mathematical explanations of the geometric situation that transcend the particular tool being used. This latter stage, it is suggested, should help to provide a foundation on which to build further notions of deductive reasoning in mathematics. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Appropriation of learning; Computer environments; Deductive reasoning; Dynamic geometry software; Geometry; Mathematical explanation; Mathematisation; Mediation of learning; Quadrilaterals; Secondary school; Sociocultural theory",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544259846

In the first phase of the analysis, the data are dealt with on an episode- by-episode-basis in chronological order. Sample episodes are given to illustrate how inferences made while analyzing one episode are viewed as initial conjectures that can be revised when analyzing subsequent episodes. In later phases of the analysis, these conjectures become data that are (meta-)analyzed to create chronologies that are structured by general assertions and yet are grounded in the particulars of students' mathematical activity.

We go back to the origin of inquiry as a pedagogical concept in the work of Dewey (e.g. 1916, 1938) to analyse and discuss its migration to science and mathematics education. For conceptualizing inquiry-based mathematics education (IBME) it is important to analyse how this concept resonates with already well-established theoretical frameworks in mathematics education. Six such frameworks are analysed from the perspective of inquiry: the problem-solving tradition, the theory of didactical situations, the realistic mathematics education programme, the mathematical modelling perspective, the anthropological theory of didactics, and the dialogical and critical approach to mathematics education. In an appendix these frameworks are illustrated with paradigmatic examples of teaching activities with inquiry elements. The paper is rounded off with a list of ten concerns for the development and implementation of IBME. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887357200

The choice of the aspects, which form the main facets of the framework, was based on integrated knowledge from several bodies of work: the role and importance of the topic in the discipline of mathematics and in the mathematics curriculum; research and theoretical work on learning, knowledge and understanding of mathematical concepts in general and the specific topic in particular; and research and theoretical work on teachers' subject matter knowledge and its role in teaching.

We report the results of our research with these tasks at two levels. First, we present a detailed analysis of the mathematical reasoning development of one small group of students across the sequence of tasks. Second, we provide a macrolevel analysis of the diversity of thinking patterns identified on two of the problem tasks where we incorporate data from multiple groups of students. Student reasoning about the relationships between and among quantities and their application in related situations is discussed. The results suggest that students were able to create generalizable and reusable systems or models for selecting, ranking, and weighting data. Furthermore, the extent of variations in the approaches that students took suggests that there are multiple paths for the development of ideas about ranking data for decision making.","Cognitive development; Conceptual knowledge; Higher order thinking; Mathematical modeling; Middle grades 5-8; Problem solving; Reasoning; Statistics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037347038

The following questions are addressed: How do children make sense of physical devices designed by experts to foster mathematical learning? How does the use of such devices enable learners to access selected aspects of a mathematical domain? The concept of transparency is suggested as an index of access to knowledge and activities rather than as an inherent feature of objects. The analysis shows that transparency is a process mediated by unfolding activities and users' participation in ongoing socioculturel practices.","Functions; Instructional technology; Manipulatives; Middle grades, 5-8; Patterns, relationships in mathematics; Protocol analysis; Representations, modeling; Social and cultural issues",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944432729

We propose an alternative model, the Visualizer/Analyzer or VA model, that assumes visualization and analysis to be mutually dependent in mathematical problem solving, rather than unrelated opposites.

In order to understand student behaviour in classrooms we need to increase our understanding of what motivation is and how it is regulated. Two issues relevant to a critique of mainstream motivation research need consideration: (a) the importance of the unconscious in motivation and (b) focusing on motivational states and processes rather than traits. In the present paper, motivation is conceptualised as a potential to direct behaviour through the mechanisms that control emotion. As a potential, motivation cannot be directly observed. It is observable only as it manifests itself in affect and cognition, for example as beliefs, values and emotional reactions. This potential is structured through needs and goals. Based on this view of motivation and the author's earlier studies, three aspects of motivation regulation are discussed. Primarily, goals are derived from needs: in learning situations, the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and social belonging are the most significant determinants of goal choices. As a second aspect, this view accepts the influence of students' beliefs about the accessibility of different goals. As a third aspect, the influence of automatic emotional reactions for goal regulation will be discussed. The case of Frank will be used 1) to illustrate how motivation can be inferred from different kinds of data and 2) as an example of how conflicting goals lead to non-straightforward self-regulation. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Affect; Emotion; Goal; Mathematics learning; Motivation; Needs; Self-regulation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750360005

We analyzed 1 year of her classroom instruction to determine the robustness with which she integrated algebraic reasoning into the regular course of daily instruction and its subsequent impact on students' ability to reason algebraically. We took the diversity of types of algebraic reasoning, their frequency and form of integration, and techniques of instructional practice that supported students' algebraic reasoning as a measure of the robustness of her capacity to build algebraic reasoning. Results indicate that the teacher was able to integrate algebraic reasoning into instruction in planned and spontaneous ways that led to positive shifts in students' algebraic reasoning skills.","Algebra; Elementary, K-8; Professional development; Teacher education; Teachers (characteristics of); Teaching practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27744583706

This hypothesis is referred to as the reorganization hypothesis because when a new scheme is established by using another scheme in a novel way, the new scheme can be regarded as a reorganization of the prior scheme. In that case where children's fractional schemes do emerge as accomodations in their numerical counting schemes, I regard the fractional schemes as superseding their earlier numerical counting schemes. If one scheme supersedes another, that does not mean the earlier scheme is replaced by the superseding scheme. Rather, it means that the superseding scheme solves the problems the earlier scheme solved but solves them better, and it solves new problems the earlier scheme didn't solve. It is in this sense that we hypothesized children's fractional schemes can supersede their numerical counting schemes and it is the sense in which we regarded numerical schemes as constructive mechanisms in the production of fractional schemes (Kieren, 1980). © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

It is suggested that beliefs about mathematics can usefully be considered in terms of a matrix that accommodates the possibility of differing views of school mathematics and the discipline. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Belief systems; Nature of mathematics; School mathematics; Teacher beliefs",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555189799

We focus on the concepts of patterns, function, and generalization in mathematics education in examining how 15 third grade students (9 years old) come to produce and represent generalizations during the implementation of two lessons from a longitudinal study of early algebra. Many students scan output values of f(n) as n increases, conceptualizing the function as a recursive sequence. If this instructional route is pursued, educators need to recognize how students' conceptualizations of functions depart from the closed form expressions ultimately aimed for. Even more fundamentally, it is important to nurture a transition from empirical generalizations, based on conjectures regarding cases at hand, to theoretical generalizations that follow from operations on explicit statements about mathematical relations. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2007.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449190283

Recent research has begun to investigate algebra reform in the context of elementary school (grades K-5) mathematics, focusing in particular on the development of algebraic reasoning. Yet, to date, little research has focused on the development of algebraic reasoning in middle school (grades 6-8). This article focuses on middle school students' understanding of two core algebraic ideas-equivalence and variable-and the relationship of their understanding to performance on problems that require use of these two ideas. The data suggest that students' understanding of these core ideas influences their success in solving problems, the strategies they use in their solution processes, and the justifications they provide for their solutions.

In such environments, teachers will often work to create situations where students are invited to express their thinking, most especially to peers. How is this done? In the work reported here, both teacher questioning and teacher listening will play important parts, as does the teacher's background understanding of the mathematics and the children. This study focuses especially on teacher questioning in third- and fourth-grade classrooms associated with a longitudinal study now in its eleventh year. Analyses of videotaped data indicate a strong relationship between (1) careful monitoring of students' constructions leading to a problem solution, and (2) the posing of a timely question which can challenge learners to advance their understanding.

From the correct responses, 12 distinct calculation strategies were identified and grouped into categories from which the children's intuitive models of multiplication and division were inferred. It was found that the students used 3 main intuitive models: direct counting, repeated addition, and multiplicative operation. A fourth model, repeated subtraction, only occurred in division problems. All the intuitive models were used with all semantic structures, their frequency varying as a complex interaction of age, size of numbers, language, and semantic structure. The results are interpreted as showing that children acquire an expanding repertoire of intuitive models and that the model they employ to solve any particular problem reflects the mathematical structure they impose on it.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21744432699

The students that study chemistry according to this program are involved in an inquiry process that included all the inquiry skills namely: identifying problems, formulating hypotheses, designing an experiment, gathering and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions about scientific problems and phenomena. While conducting these activities in small collaborative groups, they were encouraged to discuss their ideas about the scientific phenomena they were observing with their classmates and they were provided the time needed to accomplish it. A case study of inquiry activity of a group of three students is described and analyzed using a model of metacognition that was presented by Schraw (1998). The transcripts of the interviews of 20 students were analyzed using a model of Flavell et al. (2002). It was found that while performing the inquiry activity, the students practiced their metacognitive abilities in various stages of the inquiry process. The analysis of the interviews indicated that the students that participated in the research expressed their metacognitive knowledge regarding the inquiry activity. Thus, it is claimed that an inquiry-type laboratory that is properly planned and performed can give students an opportunity to practice metacognitive skills, which are regarded in recent years as one of the key goals in our attempt to broaden the scope of learning skills developed through learning science. © 2007 National Science Council.","Inquiry-type laboratory; Laboratory work; Metacognition",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349137928

We suggest that inferentialism can serve as a valuable theoretical resource for reform efforts that advocate ISI.

Often, however, teachers' diagnosis of 'negative attitude' is a causal attribution of students' failure, perceived as global and uncontrollable, rather than an accurate interpretation of students' behaviour, capable of steering future action. In order to make this diagnosis useful for dealing with students' difficulties in mathematics, it is necessary to clarify the construct attitude from a theoretical viewpoint, while keeping in touch with the practice that motivates its use. With this aim, we investigated how students tell their own relationship with mathematics, proposing the essay ""Me and maths"" to more than 1,600 students (1st to 13th grade). A multidimensional characterisation of a student's attitude towards mathematics emerges from this study. This characterisation and the study of the evolution of attitude have many important consequences for teachers' practice and education. For example, the study shows how the relationship with mathematics is rarely told as stable, even by older students: this result suggests that it is never too late to change students' attitude towards mathematics. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Attitude towards mathematics; Narrative research; Students' failure in mathematics; Teachers' education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949295768

Written responses were examined to determine the kinds of problems posed in this task setting, to make inferences about cognitive processes used to generate the problems, and to examine differences between problems posed prior to solving the problem and those posed during or after solving. Although some responses were ill-posed or poorly stated problems, subjects generated a large number of reasonable problems during both problem-posing phases, thereby suggesting that these teachers and prospective teachers had some personal capacity for mathematical problem posing. Subjects posed problems using both affirming and negating processes; that is, not only by generating goal statements while keeping problem constraints fixed but also by manipulating the task's implicit assumptions and initial conditions. A sizable portion of the posed problems were produced in clusters of related problems, thereby suggesting systematic problem generation. Subjects posed more problems before problem solving than during or after problem solving, and they tended to shift the focus of their posing between posing phases based at least in part on the intervening problem-solving experience.

By participating over time in these varied contexts, mathematics teachers refine their conceptions about their craft - the big ideas of mathematics, mathematics-specific pedagogy, and sense of self as a mathematics teacher.

In the initial phase of this project, a questionnaire exploring students' aspirations was developed, validated and trialled with nearly 300 primary school students. Principal component analyses and Cronbach's alpha revealed that the questionnaire was comprised of a number of unidimensional components and that reliability was acceptable. Further multivariate analyses indicated that students' aspirations in science were most strongly predicted by parental attitudes to science, attitudes towards school science, self-concept in science, images of scientists and engagement in science-related activities outside of school. Moreover, 'Asian' students appeared to exhibit a highly positive set of attitudes towards science and aspirations in science, particularly when compared with White students.

Science is viewed as a hypothetico-deductive (HD) enterprise engaging in the generation and test of alternative explanations. Explanation generation and test requires the use of several key reasoning patterns and sub-patterns. Reasoning at the highest level is complicated by the fact that scientific explanations generally involve the postulation of non-perceptible entities, thus arguments used in their test require sub-arguments to link the postulate under test with its deduced consequence. Science is HD in nature because this is how the brain spontaneously processes information whether it basic visual recognition, every-day descriptive and causal hypothesis testing, or advanced theory testing. The key point in terms of complex HD arguments is that if sufficient chunking of concepts and/or reasoning sub-patterns have not occurred, then one's attempt to construct and maintain such arguments in working memory and use them to draw conclusions and construct concepts will ""fall apart."" Thus, the conclusions and concepts will be ""lost."" Consequently, teachers must know what students bring with them in terms of their stages of intellectual development (i.e., preoperational, concrete, formal, or post-formal) and subject-specific declarative knowledge. Effective instruction mirrors the practice of science where students confront puzzling observations and then personally participate in the explanation generation and testing process - a process in which some of their ideas are contradicted by the evidence and by the arguments of others. © National Science Council.","Brain functioning; Instruction; Intellectual development; Reasoning; Scientific literacy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644503207

To try to produce knowing-to, formal education focuses on forms of knowing which are easier to teach and to test: knowing-that (factual), knowing-how (technique and skills), and knowing-why (having a story in order to structure actions and from which to reconstruct actions). Together these constitute knowing-about the subject. Expertise is demonstrated by being able to respond to assessments: to write essays and to solve routine problems. The central problem of education is that knowing-about does not in itself guarantee knowing-to, as teachers have attested throughout the ages. For example, Edward Fitzgerald (Harrison, 1937) captures it beautifully in one stanza of his purported translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam: Myself when young did eagerly frequent, Doctor and Saint and heard great argument, About it and about: but ever more Came out by the same door as in I went (p. 341). Instead of trying to reach definitions, we illustrate distinctions amongst kinds of knowing as used by various authors in the past. Then we turn to our own experience, for it is in one's own experience that one can locate and enliven sources of metaphoric resonances and metonymic triggers which constitute understanding. Drawing on our experience we distinguish knowing-to from other forms of knowing, and explore implications of that distinction for teaching and learning mathematics. We propose that knowing-to act in the moment depends on the structure of attention in the moment, depends on what one is aware of. Educating this awareness is most effectively done by labelling experiences in which powers have been exhibited, and developing a rich network of connections and triggers so that actions 'come to mind'. No-one can act if they are unaware of a possibility to act; no-one can act unless they have an act to perform. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947725715

Linking these two perspectives leads to addressing situation-specific skills such as perception, interpretation and decision-making, indicative of revealing a teacher’s knowledge while in the act of teaching. The aim of this study is to systematically review empirical research into mathematics teachers’ situation-specific skills. From the databases Eric, PsycINFO and MathEduc a total of 60 articles were included in the review, based on specific criteria. The studies were categorized with respect to theoretical frameworks used, designs and methods applied as well as the main findings of each study. Teachers’ noticing or teachers’ professional vision, and teachers’ (situated) professional knowledge were found to be the most frequent frameworks. Designs ranged from comprehensive case studies with a variety of methods to confirmatory studies testing a large sample with standardized instruments. The main findings suggest: (1) Teachers’ expertise and experience positively influence noticing and teachers’ noticing can be successfully fostered by (video-based) professional development programs. (2) Pre-service teachers struggle with perceiving and interpreting students’ work. Thereby, their mathematical knowledge plays an important role. (3) Teachers’ in-the-moment decision-making is influenced by their knowledge, beliefs and goals. (4) Teachers’ knowledge and belief facets predict their situation specific-skills which in turn correlate with aspects close to instructional practice. (5) Teachers have difficulties interpreting tasks and identifying their educational potential.

The items discussed in this paper targeted mathematics teachers' perceptions of possible barriers and enablers to their intention to use technology in their teaching. The responses are varied but, overall, strength of agreement with enablers outweighed agreement with perceived barriers. However, it is clear that despite an overall positive attitude towards the use of technology for teaching mathematics, some perceived barriers to change are notable. It is, therefore, helpful if those responsible for professional development, promoting the use of technology, recognise and address these barriers as well as working to strengthening enablers. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Calculator; Computer; Secondary mathematics; Teachers' perceptions; Technology; Theory of planned behaviour",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349096314

Yet this approach, even when resulting in empirically effective educational products, remains under-conceptualized as long as researchers cannot be explicit about their craft and specifically how data analyses inform design decisions. Consequentially, design decisions may appear arbitrary, design methodology is insufficiently documented for broad dissemination, and design practice is inadequately conversant with learning-sciences perspectives. One reason for this apparent under-theorizing, I propose, is that designers do not have appropriate constructs to formulate and reflect on their own intuitive responses to students' observed interactions with the media under development. Recent socio-cultural explication of epistemic artifacts as semiotic means for mathematical learners to objectify presymbolic notions (e.g., Radford, Mathematical Thinking and Learning 5(1): 37-70, 2003) may offer design-based researchers intellectual perspectives and analytic tools for theorizing design improvements as responses to participants' compromised attempts to build and communicate meaning with available media. By explaining these media as potential semiotic means for students to objectify their emerging understandings of mathematical ideas, designers, reciprocally, create semiotic means to objectify their own intuitive design decisions, as they build and improve these media. Examining three case studies of undergraduate students reasoning about a simple probability situation (binomial), I demonstrate how the semiotic approach illuminates the process and content of student reasoning and, so doing, explicates and possibly enhances design-based research methodology. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Binomial; Cognition; College; Combinatorial analysis; Computer; Gesture; Media; Model; Multimodality; Outcome distribution; Probability; ProbLab; Problem solving; Reasoning; Semiotics; Simulation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849126299

The results of a study with 8 mathematicians are reported. The mathematicians were observed as they read purported mathematical proofs and made judgments about their validity; they were then asked reflective interview questions about their validation processes and their views on proving. The results suggest that mathematicians use several different modes of reasoning in proof validation, including formal reasoning and the construction of rigorous proofs, informal deductive reasoning, and example-based reasoning. Conceptual knowledge plays an important role in the validation of proofs. The practice of validating a proof depends upon whether a student or mathematician wrote the proof and in what mathematical domain the proof was situated.

Recognizing that adequately assessing CT implies the assessment of both domain-specific and domain-general CT skills, this study reports on the development and validation of a test designed to measure students’ acquisition of CT skills in electricity and magnetism (CTEM). The CTEM items were designed to mirror the structural components of items identified in an existing standardized domain-general CT test, and targeted content from an introductory Electricity and Magnetism (E&M) course. A preliminary version of the CTEM test was initially piloted on three groups of samples: interviews with physics experts (N = 3), student cognitive interviews (N = 6), and small-scale paper and pencil administration (N = 19). Modifications were made afterwards and the test was administered to a different group of second-year students whose major was mechanical engineering (N = 45). The results showed that the internal consistency (Cronbach’s α =.72) and inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa =.83) of the CTEM test are acceptable. The findings overall suggest that the CTEM test can be used to measure the acquisition of domain-specific CT skills in E&M, and a good basis for future empirical research that focuses on the integration of CT skills within specific subject matter instruction. A broader CT assessment framework is proposed and possible research questions that can be addressed through the CTEM test are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).","Assessment; Domain-specific critical thinking; Physics; Science education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959353046

We hypothesized that this is an instance of intuitive reasoning and thus can persist in adults, even when they respond correctly. This was tested by means of a reaction time method, relying on a dual process perspective that differentiates between intuitive and analytic reasoning. We measured fifty-eight educated adults' accuracies and reaction times in a variety of rational number tasks. In half of the items (congruent), the correct response was compatible with natural number properties (thus intuitive reasoning led to a correct answer). In contrast, in the incongruent items, intuitive reasoning would lead to an incorrect answer. In comparing two numbers, there were hardly any natural-number-based errors but correct responses to incongruent items took longer. Regarding the effect of operations, more mistakes were made in incongruent items, and correct responses required longer reaction time. Incongruent items about density elicited considerably more errors than congruent items.

Attitudes towards mathematics were extremely complex and diverse in nature. Mathematics was described by the teachers as being refined and structured. The aspects of formalism, schematic orientation (short: scheme), process and application wnich are known from former research could be reproduced by a factor analysis from the 77-item questionnaires. These are dimensions around which the teachers structure their recognition and cognitive representation of mathematics, thus, creating the central characteristics of a mathematical view of the world. These attitudes and beliefs represent a global partial structure as four main dimensions, which was primary the goal of the survey. The structure derived from the significant, partial correlations forms a graph which corresponds with the theoretical presumptions of leading antagonistic views of mathematics as a 'process' and as a system.' The 'formalism' and 'scheme' aspects (schematic orientation) positively correlate with one another and represent both aspects of a static view of mathematics as a 'system.' They stand in opposition to the dynamical view of mathematics as a process. The aspect concerning the applicability of mathematics is only significantly connected with the aspect 'process.' Thus, the mathematical world view is relatively consistent and coherent. Differences in the global view of mathematics regarding the aspects of 'formalism', 'process' and 'application' among teachers of varying school types could not be proven.

These include initiating the negotiation of classroom norms that foster argumentation as the core of students' mathematical activity, providing support for students as they interact with each other to develop arguments, and supplying argumentative supports (data, warrants, and backing) that are either omitted or left implicit. We gain two important insights from these analyses. First, an emphasis on argumentation can be used productively to provide openings in mathematical discussions for new mathematical concepts and tools to emerge. Second, the analyses demonstrate that teachers need to have both an in-depth understanding of students' mathematical conceptual development and a sophisticated understanding of the mathematical concepts that underlie the instructional activities being used. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The framework reported here is the result of investigating in depth six students' understandings through a series of task-based individual interviews and classroom observations. The two major themes of the framework, the function-as-solution dilemma theme and students' intuitions and images theme, extend previous research on student cognition at the secondary and collegiate level to the domain of differential equations and reflect the increased recognition of situating analyses of student learning within students' learning environment.

The girls were thought to profit less than boys from additional effort and to exert relatively more effort to achieve the level of actual performance in mathematics. Teachers rated mathematics as more difficult for average achieving girls than for equally achieving boys.

The arguments for using history are divided into two categories; history as a tool and history as a goal. The ways of using history are placed into three categories of approaches: the illumination, the modules, and the history-based approaches. This categorization, along with a discussion of the motivation for using history being one concerned with either the inner issues (in-issues) or the metaperspective issues (meta-issues) of mathematics, provides a means of ordering the discussion of whys and hows. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Genetic principle; History as a tool, history as a goal; Illumination, modules, and history-based approaches; In-issues and meta-issues; Indispensability of arguments; Using history in mathematics education; Whys and hows",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349135354

Researchers claim to have found both consistencies and inconsistencies between professed and attributed beliefs. In this paper, methods and research designs typically used in studies of teachers' beliefs are examined. It is asserted that, in some cases, the perceived discrepancy between professed and attributed beliefs may actually be an artifact of the methods used to collect and analyze relevant data and the particular conceptualizations of beliefs implicit in the research designs. In particular, the apparent dichotomy can be the result of a lack of shared understanding between teachers and researchers of the meaning of terms used to describe beliefs and practices. In addition, it is asserted that it is inappropriate to classify any belief as entirely professed since researchers make various attributions to teachers through choices about data collection, theory, analysis of data, and presentation of findings. Moreover, the emphasis on classifying beliefs in this manner may be inhibiting researchers from developing a more comprehensive understanding of teachers' beliefs. Traditional and alternative methods are described, a data example is provided to illustrate the claims, and implications for future research are discussed. © Springer 2005.","Mathematics teacher cognition; Research methods; Teacher beliefs; Teacher practices",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21844443352

We discuss and illustrate our use of Toulmin's model of argumentation to develop an analytical technique for documenting the emergence and stability of classroom mathematical practices. This analysis is significant in that it contributes to an emerging body of research on students' learning in social context, in particular at the undergraduate level where such analyses are lacking. Our analysis also serves as a case to examine the construct of classroom mathematical practices in new light and to extend prior research by documenting two theoretical ideas; that practices can emerge in a non-sequential fashion with regard to both time and structure. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Belief-scale scores indicated that significant changes in their beliefs and perceptions about mathematics instruction occurred across the 2-year sequence of professional course work and student teaching during their undergraduate program but that their use of knowledge of children's mathematical thinking during instructional planning and teaching was limited. Preservice teachers may acknowledge the tenets of CGI and yet be unable to use them in their teaching.

Her sensitivity in communicating her expectations for students' participation was evident during both discussion and disagreement.

This paper follows the call for more situated and performance-related ways to assess teacher competence. We discuss the theoretical and methodological challenges connected to the development of such instruments and exemplify these by an instrument developed within the follow-up study of the international “Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M)”, called TEDS-FU. Drawing on the novice-expert framework from cognitive psychology allows analysing the structure and development of mathematics teachers’ professional competence. More recent concepts on teacher noticing of classroom situations and students’ activities are incorporated into this video-based evaluation instrument, which is described in detail in this paper, by assessing perceptual, interpretative and decision-making skills. Reliability and validity concerns remain an issue of such assessments for which solutions are proposed. Overall, the paper shows that a more comprehensive evaluation of teachers’ competence comprising cognitive-affective and situated facets is possible and has been achieved. © 2015, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Decision-making; Mathematics teacher education; Noticing; Perception skills; Performance assessment; Teacher competence; Teacher knowledge; Video-based assessment",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939954212

The findings suggest that students' initial conception of a 3-D rectangular array of cubes is as an uncoordinated set of faces. Eventually, as students become capable of coordinating views, they see the array as space filling and strive to restructure it as such. Those who complete a global restructuring of the array use layering strategies. Those in transition use strategies that indicate that their restructuring is local rather than global.

Participants included 106 students; 39 received the early algebra intervention, and 67 received their district's regularly planned mathematics instruction. We share and discuss students' responses to a written pre-and post-assessment that addressed their understanding of several big ideas in the area of early algebra, including mathematical equivalence and equations, generalizing arithmetic, and functional thinking. We found that the intervention group significantly outperformed the nonintervention group and was more apt by posttest to use algebraic strategies to solve problems. Given the multitude of studies among adolescents documenting students' difficulties with algebra and the serious consequences of these difficulties, an important contribution of this research is the finding that-provided the appropriate instruction-children are capable of engaging successfully with a broad and diverse set of big algebraic ideas.","Algebra; Algebraic thinking; Early algebra; Elementary grades",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922261094

Changing students' ideas about science laboratory teaching and learning and creating more positive attitudes towards science were accomplished by using a guided open-ended approach to investigations, together with instructors who used cooperative learning groups to create a supportive environment. Ideas and attitudes prior to the course were assessed using a questionnaire focusing on the students' previous science laboratory courses, and these were compared to data collected at the end of the course. Students reported large and statistically significant improvements on all seven scales assessing the laboratory learning environment and attitudes towards science. The largest gains were observed for Open-Endedness and Material Environment (with effect sizes of 6.74 and 3.82 standard deviations, respectively). An investigation of attitude-environment associations revealed numerous positive and statistically significant associations in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

The findings suggest that what researchers typically consider a surface feature can present conceptual complexities for students that are more structural in nature than previously understood. In particular, we investigated the quantitative reasoning (meaning reasoning with measurable properties of an object) that is involved in making sense of a typical transfer situation. Two related analyses - one focused on quantitative reasoning and one on transfer - were performed on a case study. The results document how a student reconstructed his understanding of the relationships among quantities in a complex transfer situation in such a way that he was able to see the situation as fundamentally proportional in nature and subsequently make connections with previous proportional-reasoning experiences from a teaching experiment. In our discussion of the findings, we identify four relationships between quantitative reasoning and transfer. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

An analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of tasks in textbooks from four perspectives: the type of context used in tasks, the purpose of context-based tasks, the type of information provided in tasks, and the type of cognitive demands of tasks. With this framework, three Indonesian mathematics textbooks were analyzed. Our analysis showed that only about 10 % of the tasks in the textbooks are context-based tasks. Moreover, at least 85 % of these tasks provide exactly the information needed to solve them and do not leave room for students to select relevant information by themselves. Furthermore, of the context-based tasks, 45 % are reproduction tasks requiring performing routine mathematical procedures, 53 % are connection tasks requiring linking different mathematical curriculum strands, and only 2 % are reflection tasks, which are considered as tasks with the highest level of cognitive demand. A linkage between the findings of the error analysis and the textbook analysis suggests that the lacking opportunity-to-learn in Indonesian mathematics textbooks may cause Indonesian students’ difficulties in solving context-based tasks.

This definition is used in the subsequent sections to distinguish between algebraic and arithmetic generalizations and some elementary nai{dotless}̈ve forms of induction to which students often resort to solve pattern problems. The rest of the paper discusses the implementation of a teaching sequence in a Grade 7 class and focuses on the social, sign-mediated processes of objectification through which the students reached stable forms of algebraic reflection.

The programs differ in instructional design to enable comparison of 2 contrasting instructional concepts. The Realistic Program Design (RPD) stimulates flexible use of solution procedures from the beginning by using realistic context problems. The Gradual Program Design (GPD) has as its purpose a gradual increase of knowledge through initial emphasis on procedural computation followed by flexible problem solving. We found that whereas RPD pupils showed a more varied use of solution procedures than the GPD pupils, this variation did not influence the procedural competence of the pupils.

The present study reports data from interviews in which students attempted to solve problems involving the appropriate weighting and combining of means into an overall mean. While mathematically unsophisticated college students can easily compute the mean of a group of numbers, our results indicate that a surprisingly large proportion of them do not understand the concept of the weighted mean. When asked to calculate the overall mean, most subjects answered with the simple, or unweighted, mean of the two means given in the problem, even though these two means were from different-sized groups of scores. For many subjects, computing the simple mean was not merely the easiest or most obvious way to initially attack the problem; it was the only method they had available. Most did not seem to consider why the simple mean might or might not be the correct response, nor did they have any feeling for what their results represented. For many students, dealing with the mean is a computational rather than a conceptual act. Knowledge of the mean seems to begin and end with an impoverished computational formula. The pedagogical message is clear: Learning a computational formula is a poor substitute for gaining an understanding of the basic underlying concept. © 1981 D.

Thirty K.-8 preservice teachers completed 4 written tasks. Each task specified a learning goal and then asked the preservice teachers to complete a teaching activity with this goal in mind. For example, preservice teachers were asked to evaluate whether a student's responses to a series of mathematics problems showed understanding of decimal number addition. The results indicate that preservice teachers can identify mathematical subconcepts of learning goals in supportive contexts but do not spontaneously apply a strategy of unpacking learning goals to plan for, or evaluate, teaching and learning.

This study investigates the effects of using a coherent video-case curriculum in a university mathematics methods course by addressing two issues: (1) how the use of a video-case curriculum affects the reflective stance of prospective teachers (PTs); and (2) the extent to which a reflective stance developed while reflecting on other teachers' practice transfers for reflecting on one's own practice. Data sources include videotapes of course sessions and PTs' written work from a middle school mathematics methods course that used a video-case curriculum as a major instructional tool. Both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods were used, including comparative and chi-square contingency table analyses. The PTs in this study showed changes in their level of reflection, their tendency to ground their analyses in evidence, and their focus on student thinking. In particular, they began to analyze teaching in terms of how it affects student thinking, to consider multiple interpretations of student thinking, and to develop a more tentative stance of inquiry. More significantly, the reflective stance developed via the video curriculum transferred to the PTs' self-reflection in a course field experience. The results of this study speak to the power of using a video-case curriculum as a means of developing a reflective stance in prospective mathematics teachers. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Case method; Mathematics teacher education; Preservice teacher education; Reflection; Teacher learning; Video cases",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51749089317

I compare the stories of these research mathematicians with practices in mathematics classrooms and conclude with an appeal for teachers to pay attention to the practices of research mathematicians and their implications for coming to know mathematics. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54649084398

Furthermore, the effects of sample size upon measures of central tendency and variability can be learned by students working on activities such as those developed for the experimental course in this study. Making guesses for the probability of events and checking guesses with a hand-held calculator seems to help college students to be more cautious about probability estimates, and helps to make them aware about some of their own misconceptions about probability. Small-group problem solving, keeping a log of all class work and activities, and investigating the misuses of statistics all appeared to have a positive effect upon college students' attitudes towards mathematics, as indicated in the questionnaires filled out by the subjects in the experimental sections. The present results of this study support the hypotheses of Kahneman and Tversky [10, 12] which claimed that combinatorially naive college students rely upon availability and representativeness to estimate the likelihood of events. Kahneman and Tversky were skeptical about the possibility of helping students to overcome their reliance upon availability and representativeness. The results on the posttest in this study suggest that the manner in which college students learn probability makes a difference in their ability to overcome misconceptions that arise from availability and representativeness. Mere exposure to probability concepts is not sufficient to overcome certain misconceptions of probability. Fischbein [9] notes that the ""synthesis between the necessary and the possible-which is the basis of probabilistic thinking-does not in fact take place spontaneously ...."" He claims that science education emphasizes only the deterministic aspect, and neglects the study of uncertainty. Thus peoples' intuition of probabilistic thinking is distorted by science education's emphasis on the necessary, and neglect of the possible. This experiment suggests that the course methodology and the teaching model used in an elementary probability course can help develop peoples' intuition for probabilistic thinking. A course in which students carry out experiments, work through activities to build their own probability models, and discover counting principles for themselves can help students to overcome their misconceptions about probability, and can help restore the synthesis between the necessary and the possible which is essential to probabilistic thinking. © 1977 D.

Having briefly described the educational and philosophical problem regarding the origin and nature of these objects we then present the main characteristics of a pragmatic and anthropological semiotic approach to them, one which may serve as the outline of a philosophy of mathematics developed from the point of view of mathematics education.

Thus, this study is about Slovak students' attitude toward biology through six dimensions; interest, career, importance, teacher, equipment and difficulty. The study used a 30-item Biology Attitude Questionnaire (BAQ) to measure students' attitudes toward biology education. The data were obtained from 655 secondary school students attending eight typical elementary schools in Slovakia. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed a negative effect of age whereas the effect of gender was not significant. Univariate results, on the other hand, indicated that there is a significant interaction of students' interest in relation with grade and gender. One of the findings of the study is that, students' attitude toward biology teacher is strongly affected by teacher identity. This can be taken as a hint for future research. That effect of teacher should be included as a parameter to be considered for the studies related to student attitude.

The framework of Connected Mathematics is used to analyze the learners' coming to understanding of normal distributions and as a source of therapeutic intervention for the epistemological anxiety. As both a symbolizing medium and an aid to analysis, one learner is provided with an object-based parallel modeling language (OBPML) with which the learner can formulate computational hypotheses about the local probability rules that lead to the emergence of a global distribution. Through the investigation, supported by the OBPML, the learner makes connections between the micro-rules of probability and the resultant (macro-) statistical distributions. Conclusions are then drawn about the features of a Connected Mathematics learning environment that enable confrontation with epistemological anxiety and the features of modeling languages that enable learners to conduct a successful probability investigation. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000283159

Despite variation in how IBL was implemented, student outcomes are improved in IBL courses relative to traditionally taught courses,as assessed by general measures that apply across course types. Particularly striking, the use of IBL eliminates a sizable gender gap that disfavors women students in lecture-based courses.

It is thought that extrinsic factors such as family, community, and schools might be more influential than intrinsic attitudes toward science interest. However, there are relatively few valid and reliable measures of intrinsic factors such as interest relating to science. With the lack of intrinsic measures, it is difficult to determine the impact of extrinsic factors on the intrinsic construct. A fuller picture of the factors affecting intrinsic factors such as science interest will allow interventions to become more refined and targeted. Several studies suggest that student interest toward science affects the likelihood of the student pursuing advanced courses in science. The goal of this paper is to establish the validity and reliability of the Science Interest Survey and to determine if the survey meets the formal requirements of measurements as defined by the Rasch model. Results using both IRT and CRT analysis suggest that Science Interest Survey is an adequate measure of the unidimensional construct known as science interest. Results further suggest the Science Interest Survey is a valid and reliable measure for assessing science interest levels. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan.","Rasch model; Science Interest Survey; USA",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861762204

The second environment represented a 'typical' English classroom with a content based scheme being predominantly used. The research demonstrated that the procedure and performance of students in response to addition and fraction tasks varied considerably when the context of the tasks changed. This variation suggested that students' perceptions of the contexts were individually constructed and contexts did not have a uniform effect upon the difficulty of tasks. The research also suggested that students who had learned in an environment characterised by the integration of process and content were more able to transfer their learning across contexts. Students who had learned mathematical process independently of content were more likely to vary their procedure and performance in response to the contexts of the tasks.

We draw on multiple case study visits by college students and teacher-researchers to workplaces. By asking questions that 'open boxes', we 'outsiders and boundary-crossers' sought to expose contradictions between College and work, induce breakdowns and identify salient mathematics. Typically, we find that mathematical processes have been historically crystallised in 'black boxes' shaped by workplace cultures: its instruments, rules and divisions of labour tending to disguise or hide mathematics. These black boxes are of two kinds, signalling two key processes by which mathematics is put to work. The first involves automation, when the work of mathematics is crystallised in instruments, tools and routines: this process tends to distribute and hide mathematical work, but also evolves a distinct workplace 'genre' of mathematical practice. The second process involves sub-units of the community being protected from mathematics by a division of labour supported by communal rules, norms and expectations.

Sometimes pupils demonstrate content-universe fixation, by restricting their thinking about a problem to an insufficient or inappropriate range of elements. Other times they show algorithmic fixation by continuing to adhere to a routine procedure or stereotype response even when this becomes inefficient or inappropriate. The second construct employed is that of divergent production, indicated by flexibility and originality in mathematical tasks to which a large number of appropriate responses are possible. Examples of three categories of such tasks are described: (1) problem-solving, (2) problem-posing, and (3) redefinition.

In particular, the findings of a recent study of bilingual Punjabi, Mirpuri, Italian and Jamaican 11-13 year old children growing up in England are reported. It is found that first language competence is an important factor in the child's ability to reason in mathematics in English as a second language. This gives considerable support to theories which assert that a cognitively and academically beneficial form of bilingualism can only be achieved on the basis of adequately developed first language skills. However for both English monolingual and bilingual children knowledge of logical connectives in English is a crucial factor. It is suggested that published weaknesses in mathematics found among certain Asian and West Indian pupils may well be due to language factors. Furthermore there are strong cultural forces which predispose differential performance among boys and girls.

In their mathematics methods course, ninety-four prospective elementary school teachers from three institutions participated in a researcher-developed five-session module that progressively nests the three interrelated components of professional noticing-attending, interpreting, and deciding. The module embeds video excerpts of diagnostic interviews of children doing mathematics (representations of practice) to prepare the prospective teachers for similar work. The module culminates with prospective teachers implementing similar diagnostic interviews (approximations of practice) to gain experience in the three component skills of professional noticing. A pre- and post-assessment was administered to measure prospective teachers' change in the three components. A Wilcoxon signed ranks test was conducted and found the prospective elementary school teachers demonstrated significant growth in all three components. Selected prospective elementary school teacher responses on the pre- and post-assessment are provided to illustrate sample growth in the prospective teachers' abilities to professionally notice. These results, the first in an ongoing study, indicate the potential that prospective teachers can develop professional noticing skills through this module. Continued data collection and analysis from the ongoing study by these authors and future, longer-term emphasis on professional noticing for prospective teachers should be studied. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Elementary school education; Learning progressions; Number concepts and operations; Pedagogies of practice; Teacher education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883782506

This article focuses on a cohort of English pupils who have been tracked through primal T school during the first five years of the new National Numeracy Strategy. It reports a limited longitudinal study of young children's early mathematical development, initially within three testing cycles: at the mid-point and towards the end of their reception year (at five years-of-age) and again at the mid-point of Year 1 (at six years-of-age). These cycles were located within the broader context of progress through to the end of Key Stage 1 (at seven years) and Key Stage 2 (at eleven years) on the basis of national standardised assessment tests (SATs). Results showed that children who bring into school early mathematical knowledge do appear to be advantaged in terms of their mathematical progress through primal T school. Numerical attainment increases in importance across the primal T years and practical problem solving remains an important element of this. This finding is significant given the current emphasis on numerical calculation in the English curriculum. It is concluded that without active intervention, it is likely that children with little mathematical knowledge at the beginning of formal schooling will remain low achievers throughout their primal T years and, probably, beyond.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847644379

In both studies more than 70% of the pupils wrote the achievement tests in their second or third language. A national option, an English test, was included together with the TIMSS-R mathematics and science tests in an attempt to ascertain the level of the pupils' language proficiency. Furthermore, additional questions pertaining to the pupils and their teachers' exposure and usage of English both within and outside of school were also included in the background questionnaire. In this research project that included more than 8 000 pupils in 200 schools, all the items pertaining to English proficiency and language usage and their relationship to mathematics achievement were explored. Partial Least Square analysis was used to explore the relative contribution of these factors to pupils' achievement together with other background variables from the student, teacher and principal questionnaires, resulting in the presentation of a school-level, a classroom-level model, a student-level model and a combined class and school-level model. Multi-level analysis was employed whereby a 2-level model (school and class-level and the student-level) was analysed in order to investigate the main factors explaining achievement of South African pupils in mathematics. The study revealed that the pupils' proficiency of English was a strong predictor of their success in mathematics. A number of other background variables on student and class-level were found to be significant. However, home language and class size were amongst those that were not found to have significant effect on achievement, whilst the effect of socio-economic status had a lesser effect once certain class-level factors were taken into consideration. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043160809

A fraction composition scheme consists of the operations and concepts used to determine, for example, the size of 1/3 of 1/5 of a whole in relation to the whole. Students' whole number multiplicative concepts were found to be critical constructive resources for students' fraction composition schemes. Specifically, the interiorization of two levels of units, a particular multiplicative concept, was found to be necessary for the construction of a unit fraction composition scheme, while the interiorization of three levels of units was necessary for the construction of a general fraction composition scheme. These findings contribute to previous research on students' construction of fraction multiplication that has emphasized partitioning and conceptualizing quantitative units.

Students' generalizations and proof schemes were identified and categorized in order to establish connections between types of generalizations and types of justifications. These connections led to the identification of four mechanisms for change that supported students' engagement in increasingly sophisticated forms of algebraic reasoning: (a) iterative action/reflection cycles, (b) mathematical focus, (c) generalizations that promote deductive reasoning, and (d) influence of deductive reasoning on generalizing.","Algebra; Conceptual knowledge; Constructivism; Learning; Middle grades, 5-8; Patterns/relationships in mathematics; Proof; Qualitative methods",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248512314

Understanding the role of emotions in the mathematics classroom then implies understanding the nature of these situated processes and the way they relate to students' problem-solving behaviour. We will present data from a multiple-case study of 16 students out of 4 different junior high classes that aimed to investigate students' emotional processes when solving a mathematical problem in their classrooms.

Africa, T., South Africa","This paper is part of a broader study that draws on Wenger's (Wenger, E.:1998, Communities of Pratice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity, Cambridge University Press, New Work) social practice perspective to investigate teacher learning. The study extends Wenger's complex model of interrelated components of learning (as meaning, practice, identity and community) to describe and explain teacher learning that occurs within a mathematics senior-phase in-service program that was stimulated by curriculum change. The study uses qualitative ethnography in which the researcher performs the dual role of both coordinator and researcher of the in-service practice. In a longitudinal study the phenomenon of confidence emerged in teachers' descriptions and explanations of their learning. In this paper I explore this phenomenon both empirically and theoretically. The extension of Wenger's (1998) theory to include the overarching and interacting component of confidence is embedded in and derived from data analysis of 10 teachers' learning, over a 2-year period, during a time of radical curriculum change. Since it would be incoherent within this framework to draw on psychological explanations of confidence I set out to explore confidence from within a social practice frame in a way that is grounded in data of the teachers in this study. The paper offers a concept of confidence in relation to teacher learning as 'learning as mastery', and confidence as both a product and a process of learning. Teachers can at once state their confidence as mathematics teachers, and their confidence to admit to what they do not know and still need to learn. It is argued that this is a primary condition for ongoing learning in a profession like mathematics teaching. In addition, the paper provides a critique of the applicability of Wenger's work to the context of teacher education and in particular highlights the absence of the notion of confidence within his work.","communities of practice; confidence; in-service mathematics teacher learning; social practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044272953

A custom of asking students to produce and write proofs in a 'two-column format' of statements and reasons developed as the teaching profession responded to the demands of reform. I provide a historical account for how proving evolved as a task for students in school geometry, starting from the time when geometry became a high school subject and continuing to the time when proof became the centerpiece of the geometry curriculum. I use the historical account to explain how the two-column proof format brought stability to the course of studies in geometry by making it possible for teachers to claim that they were teaching students how to prove and for students to demonstrate that their work involved proving. I also uncover what the nature of school geometry came to be as a result of the emphasis in students' learning to prove by showing that students' acquisition of a generic notion of proof was made possible at the expense of reducing students' participation in the development of new ideas. I draw connections between that century-old reform and current reform emphases on reasoning and proof.

The authors’ research with teachers has led them to explore the characteristics of MKT and to refine the descriptors relating to its sub-domains, a task which has underlined the difficulty involved in unambiguously delimiting the boundaries which separate these. As a result, and taking into consideration a broader view of the specialised nature of the teacher’s mathematical knowledge, the authors propose a framework which, whilst respecting the major domains of Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge, regards the specialisation in respect of mathematical knowledge as a property which is inherent to the model and extends across all sub-domains. © 2018, © 2018 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.","mathematical knowledge for teaching; specialised knowledge; Teachers’ knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050277223

A quasi-experimental research method was adapted. Problem solving inventory test and motivation scale were used to collect data. Subjects included were 81 grade 12 students taken from Wachemo Preparatory school. There was a mean difference between comparison and experimental groups. The covariate analysis shows that the difference was statistically significant with effect size above average. However, there was insignificant difference in motivation to learn physics. The study suggested that to improve students' achievement, schools must adapt the PBL method carefully.

However, its implementation in teacher education programmes has remained generic and tacit. This paper reports on an attempt to improve the quality of PCK in chemistry pre service teachers in a specified topic—chemical equilibrium. By locating PCK at a topic level, a refined theoretical description of the construct sensitive to the specificity of the topic is suggested and its validity argued. The refined description is grounded on the notion of transformation of topic-specific concepts to PCK, and the identification of components that enable such a transformation. The components were identified as Learners' Prior Knowledge, Curricular Saliency, What makes a topic easy or difficult to understand, Representations including analogies and Conceptual Teaching Strategies. The extent to which the explicit teaching of these five components influences the improvement of the quality of PCK within Chemical Equilibrium was determined in an intervention with 16 physical science pre-service teachers. The impact of the intervention was determined through mixed methods. The intervention resulted in a significant (99% confidence) overall improvement of the quality of PCK within chemical equilibrium. The findings signal a reciprocal relationship between PCK and the pedagogical transformation of concepts, where the latter was previously reported to result from PCK.

Using ideas from enactivism and other system theories, the third dimension is elaborated.

Creativity, however, is more often associated with the arts than with mathematics. The aim of the study was to explore and document pre-service (in the UK, pre-service teachers are referred to as 'trainee' teachers) primary teachers' conceptions of creativity in mathematics teaching in the UK. A questionnaire probed their conceptions early in their course, and these were supplemented with data from semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the responses indicated that pre-service teachers' conceptions were narrow, predominantly associated with the use of resources and technology and bound up with the idea of 'teaching creatively' rather than 'teaching for creativity'. Conceptions became less narrow as pre-service teachers were preparing to enter schools as newly qualified, but they still had difficulty in identifying ways of encouraging and assessing creativity in the classroom. This difficulty suggests that conceptions of creativity need to be addressed and developed directly during pre-service education if teachers are to meet the expectations of government as set out in the above documents. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Conceptions; Creativity; Mathematics; Pre-service teachers; Primary",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951877662

Two pairs of parallel physics and mathematics questions that involved estimation and interpretation of line graph slope were constructed and administered to 114 Croatian second year high school students (aged 15 to 16 years). Each pair of questions referred to the same skill in different contexts-one question in the context of mathematics and the other in the context of kinematics. A sample of Croatian physics teachers (N = 90) was asked to rank the questions according to their expected difficulty for second year high school students. The prevalent ranking order suggests that most physics teachers expected mathematics questions to be more difficult for students than the parallel physics questions. Contrary to the prevalent teachers' expectations, students succeeded better on mathematics than on physics questions. The analysis of student answers and explanations suggests that the lack of mathematical knowledge is not the main reason for student difficulties with graphs in kinematics. It appears that the interpretation of the meaning of line graph slope in a physics context presents the largest problem for students. However, students also showed problems with the understanding of the concept of slope in a mathematical context. Students exhibited slope/height confusion in both contexts, but much more frequently in the context of physics than in the context of mathematics. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.","kinematics; line graph; mathematics education; physics education; slope",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871035084

And this is doing more harm to their academic achievement than good. Therefore, this study examined the correlates between academic procrastination and mathematics achievement among the university mathematics undergraduate students. The study used a total sample of 150 part 3 and 4 students in the department of mathematics and mathematics education students in the university of Ibadan and university of Lagos, Nigeria. The 35 items academic procrastination scale developed and validated by Tuckman (1991) was used for the collection of data, in conjunction with the subjects GPA scores till date in mathematics. Findings indicates that: a significant correlation was found in the academic procrastination and academic achievement of the subjects in mathematics, significant difference also exists in the levels of procrastination and mathematics achievement of the subjects, with low procrastinators performing better than the moderate and the high procrastinators. Results further reveals the subjects procrastinate the same way irrespective of their gender. Implications of procrastination on academic achievement of students at all levels generally and some effective ways of remediation of procrastination were suggested.

We illustrate how each of these types of understanding can be assessed in the context of a proof in number theory. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Assessment; Proof comprehension; Proof reading; Undergraduate mathematics education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555187971

The participants were asked to perform the following task: they were presented with four graphs that represented derived functions and from these graphs they were asked to construct the original functions from which they were formed. The students then had to walk these graphs as if they were displacement-time graphs. Their discussions were recorded on audio tape and their walks were captured using data logging equipment and these were analysed together with their pencil and paper notes. From these three sources of data, we were able to construct a picture of the students' graphical understanding of connections in calculus. The results confirm that at the start of the activity the students demonstrate an algebraic symbolic view of calculus and find it difficult to make connections between the graphs of a derived function and the function itself. By being able to 'walk' an associated displacement time graph, we propose that the students are extending their understanding of calculus concepts from symbolic representation to a graphical representation and to what we term a 'physical feel'. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that beginning teachers drew in two ways from the method course: they reproduced a small number of discrete tasks that had been introduced to them there, and they also deployed a professional argot - a way of talking about teaching and learning mathematics. This recontextualizing was shaped by the beginning teachers' educational biographies and school contexts, but most particularly by access to recognition and realization rules.","Longitudinal studies; Preservice teacher education; Qualitative methods; Social and cultural issues; Teacher education; Teacher knowledge; Teaching (role, style, methods); Teaching practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035646069

Consequences for teacher training towards more reflected classroom experience are drawn. © 1980 D. Reidel Publishing Co.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007328113

Besides, a survey was made among 714 individuals. The structural equation model revealed that high levels of knowledge about recycled water stimulate individuals' trust in water authorities, and reduce their perceived risk of recycled water. More specially, knowledge about recycled water was reported to be a significant predictor of individuals' acceptability of recycled water. Individuals' high levels knowledge about recycled water can affect their acceptability of recycled water indirectly through two different ways, while high levels knowledge about recycled water can reduce the individuals' perceived risk of recycled water, so it could increase their acceptability of recycled water indirectly. Another influence path is that high levels knowledge about recycled water could reduce individuals' perceived risk of recycled water by improving their trust in the water authorities, and ultimately improve their acceptability of recycled water. In this paper, it has proved that environmental education has significance guiding effect on individuals in terms of the use of recycled water, and provided a clue as how does environmental education affects individuals' behavior to use recycled water. © Authors.","Environmental education; Recycled water reuse; Structural equation modeling",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031747693

Furthermore, in order to validate the relationship between the two constructs, we will trace groups of students that differ across mathematical ability and investigate the relationships amongst these students' performance on a mathematical ability test and the components of mathematical creativity. Data were collected by administering two tests, a mathematical ability and a mathematical creativity test, to 359 elementary school students. Mathematical ability was considered as a multidimensional construct, including quantitative ability (number sense and pre-algebraic reasoning), causal ability (examination of cause-effect relations), spatial ability (paper folding, perspective and spatial rotation abilities), qualitative ability (processing of similarity and difference relations) and inductive/deductive ability. Mathematical creativity was defined as a domain-specific characteristic, enabling individuals to be characterized by fluency, flexibility and originality in the domain of mathematics. The data analysis revealed that there is a positive correlation between mathematical creativity and mathematical ability. Moreover, confirmatory factor analysis suggested that mathematical creativity is a subcomponent of mathematical ability. Further, latent class analysis showed that three different categories of students can be identified varying in mathematical ability. These groups of students varying in mathematical ability also reflected three categories of students varying in mathematical creativity. © 2012 FIZ Karlsruhe.","Alternative models; Flexibility; Fluency; Mathematical ability; Mathematical creativity; Originality",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892860246

To address this issue, a shortened version of the Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory (short ATMI) which measures four subscales-enjoyment of mathematics, motivation to do mathematics, self-confidence in mathematics, and perceived value of mathematics-was created. Its factor structure, reliability, and validity were assessed with 1,601 participants from Singapore. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the original four-factor structure. Within this structure, however, several items were found to correlate highly with others. Their removal either improved or did not impact the properties of the instrument. As a result, these items were removed to produce the short ATMI. Furthermore, a very high correlation (r = .96) was found between the enjoyment and motivation subscales. Results of further analysis suggested the removal of the motivation subscale. The short ATMI exhibited strong correlations with the original scale (mean r = .96), good overall internal consistencies, both for the full short version (α = . 93) and for the individual subscales (mean α = .87), and satisfactory test-retest reliability over a 1-month period (mean rxx = . 75). The validity of the short ATMI was further demonstrated through inter-correlations between its subscales, and through correlations with mathematics anxiety and achievement test scores. Participants were able to complete the short ATMI in less than 10 min, making it a viable option when survey administration time is limited. This time would reduce further with the removal of the motivation subscale. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory; Confirmatory factor analysis; Mathematics attitudes; Pre-tertiary",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871083151

Western scientists seek to understand how the Universe works. The basic premise of Indigenous Sciences is participating within nature's relationships, not necessarily deciphering how they work. The Two-Eyed Seeing approach used in Integrative Science seeks to avoid knowledge domination and assimilation by recognizing the best from both worlds.

The first study examined the extent to which U.S. and Chinese students' selection of solution strategies and representations is related to their opportunity to learn algebra. The second study examined the impact of teachers' beliefs on their students' thinking through analyzing U.S. and Chinese teachers' scoring of student responses. The results of the first study showed that, for the U.S. sample, students who have formally learned algebraic concepts are as likely to use visual representations as those who have not formally learned algebraic concepts in their problem solving. For the Chinese sample, students rarely used visual representations whether or not they had formally learned algebraic concepts. The findings of the second study clearly showed that U.S. and Chinese teachers view students' responses involving concrete strategies and visual representations differently. Moreover, although both U.S. and Chinese teachers value responses involving more generalized strategies and symbolic representations equally high, Chinese teachers expect 6th graders to use the generalized strategies to solve problems while U.S. teachers do not. The research reported in this paper contributed to our understanding of the differences between U.S. and Chinese students' mathematical thinking.

However, when the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study revealed an average performance of German students compared to other participating countries, a particular proportion of low-performing students, and remarkable disparities between the federal states, German policy makers decided for a major reform of the education system. A core piece of this reform was the introduction of National Education Standards. For science education, these standards were heavily influenced by the PISA results and its underlying framework. That is, with the standards, a paradigm shift took place from the German notion of Bildung towards the Anglo-American notion of literacy. With the introduction of these standards, a new field of empirical educational research was created: research on models of scientific literacy or competency models as a basis of benchmarking the standards. This article describes the German education system before PISA, summarizes the major findings from PISA, and describes how these findings informed the formulation of the performance standards for science education. It also details the measures undertaken to benchmark these standards.

Using cluster analysis, we found four patterns in the development of preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs regarding these two factors. Our analysis of semi-structured interviews with eight participants representing these four patterns suggested that preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs were mainly informed by experimentation with teaching and interaction with mentors, tutors, peers, and pupils.

As the result of an analysis which comprises both conceptual and empirical components, we suggest that journals have the potential to contribute to mathematics instruction in several ways. As the students write the journals, they can be encouraged to express and reflect upon their feelings, knowledge, processes and beliefs about mathematics, and consequently grow along each of these dimensions. By reading their students' journals, teachers may receive a wealth of information about their students and the course, and consequently improve their teaching. Finally, journals can create a new form of dialogue between the teacher and each student, thus allowing for more individualized instruction and a supportive classroom atmosphere. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038992827

It has been shown that teachers' PCK correlates with teaching effectiveness as well as with students' achievement gains. Teachers' PCK should be analyzed as one of the main important components to evaluate professional development programs. On this account, it is necessary to develop standardized measures of biology teachers' topic-specific PCK that are labor-efficient. This paper presents a study on the development, evaluation, and validation of a paper-and-pencil test to measure biology teachers' declarative PCK on the topic of blood and the human cardiovascular system. The development of the test was based, among other considerations, on a review of research literature on PCK and an analysis of 50 videotaped biology lessons. The final test instrument was comprised of 15 items distributed across 2 scales. The findings of the main study-with 93 preservice and in-service biology teachers and 12 biologists-confirmed that this measure of biology teachers' declarative PCK was reliable, objective, and valid. In-service biology teachers scored higher on the test than preservice teachers (effect size Cohen's d, 0.65) on one hand and, also, than biologists (Cohen's d, 1.00) on the other hand. Future versions of this test should explore enlarging the scales and measuring procedural aspects of PCK. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","pedagogical content knowledge; teacher assessment; teacher knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890427720

To achieve this goal, two tests were administered to students in grades 5 to 9. The results of the study showed that 3D geometry thinking could be described by four distinct types of reasoning which refer to the representation of 3D objects, spatial structuring, conceptualisation of mathematical properties and measurement. The analysis of the study also showed that 3D geometry types of reasoning and spatial abilities should be modelled as different constructs. Finally, it was concluded that students' spatial abilities, which consist of spatial visualisation, spatial orientation and spatial relations factors, are a strong predictive factor of the four types of reasoning in 3D geometry thinking. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","3D geometry; 3D geometry thinking; 3D geometry types of reasoning; Representation; Spatial abilities; Visualisation",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957896668

In order to analyze such difficulties, we take advantage of the following perspectives of VPR: (1) Perceptual organization: Gestalt principles, (2) recognition: bottom-up and top-down processing; and (3) representation of perception-based knowledge: verbal vs. pictorial representation, mental images and hierarchical structure of images. Examples given in the paper were mostly taken from Gal's study (2005) which aimed at identifying and analyzing Problematic Learning Situations (after Gal & Linchevski, 2000) in junior high school geometry classes. Gal's study (2005) suggests that while this theoretical perspective became part of teachers' pedagogic content knowledge, the teachers were aware of their students' thinking processes and their ability to analyze and cope with their students' difficulties in geometry was improved. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Geometry; Problematic learning situation; Teacher preparation; Visual perception; Visual perception processing; Visualization",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952099293

As part of a long-term research and development project in learning and teaching undergraduate mathematics, this report is one of a series of papers on the abstract algebra component of that project. The observations discussed here were collected during a six-week summer workshop where 24 high school teachers took a course in Abstract Algebra as part of their work. By comparing written samples, and student interviews with our own theoretical analysis, we attempt to describe ways in which these individuals seemed to be approaching the concepts of group, subgroup, coset, normality, and quotient group. The general pattern of learning that we infer here illustrates an action-process-object-schema framework for addressing these specific group theory issues. We make here only some quite general observations about learning these specific topics, the complex nature of ""understanding"", and the role of errors and misconceptions in light of an action-process-schema framework. Seen as research questions for further exploration, we expect these observations to inform our continuing investigations and those of other researchers. We end the paper with a brief discussion of some pedagogical suggestions arising out of our considerations. We defer, however, a full consideration of instructional strategies and their effects on learning these topics to some future time when more extensive research can provide a more solid foundation for the design of specific pedagogies. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011677030

The results of the t-test confirmed the difference in students' cognitive achievement both of the experimental and control group. The students who were taught with RME achieved better than the students who were involved in conventional learning. This research finding has suggested that it is important for teachers to empower students' intellectual ability through RME and games in order that meaningful and contextual learning can be generated.

Existing protocols, though helpful, were either too generic or too program specific. Consequently, we developed the Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP). This manuscript examines the 2-year development cycle for the creation and validation of EQUIP. The protocol evolved over several iterations and was supported by validity checks and confirmatory factor analysis. The protocol's strength is further supported by high internal consistency and solid interrater agreement. The resulting protocol assesses 19 indicators aligned with four constructs: instruction, curriculum, assessment, and discourse. For teachers, EQUIP provides a framework to make their instructional practice more intentional as they strive to increase the quantity and quality of inquiry instruction. For researchers, EQUIP provides an instrument to analyze the quantity and quality of inquiry being implemented, which can be beneficial in evaluating professional development projects. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2009.","EQUIP; Inquiry; Inquiry protocol; Inquiry-based instruction; Mathematics education; Observational protocol; Professional development; Professional development protocol; Science education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952290308

Specifically, the article contributes to the issue of understanding and describing what knowledge about proof is likely to be important for teachers to have as they engage students in the activity of proving. We explain that existing research informs the knowledge about the logico-linguistic aspects of proof that teachers might need, and we argue that this knowledge should be complemented by what we call knowledge of situations for proving. This form of knowledge is essential as teachers mobilize proving opportunities for their students in mathematics classrooms. We identify two sub-components of the knowledge of situations for proving: knowledge of different kinds of proving tasks and knowledge of the relationship between proving tasks and proving activity. In order to promote understanding of the former type of knowledge, we develop and illustrate a classification of proving tasks based on two mathematical criteria: (1) the number of cases involved in a task (a single case, multiple but finitely many cases, or infinitely many cases), and (2) the purpose of the task (to verify or to refute statements). In order to promote understanding of the latter type of knowledge, we develop a framework for the relationship between different proving tasks and anticipated proving activity when these tasks are implemented in classrooms, and we exemplify the components of the framework using data from third grade. We also discuss possible directions for future research into teachers' knowledge about proof. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Mathematical reasoning; Mathematics tasks; Proof; Proving; School mathematics; Teacher knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249172369

We present an overview of responses at the end of Year 8 (age 13 years) and an analysis of the approaches taken and follow this with an analysis of the data collected from students who answered the question again in Year 9 (age 14 years) in order to distinguish learning trajectories. From these analyses we distinguished three strategies empirical focussed-empirical and focussed-deductive that represent shifts in attention from an inductive to a deductive approach. We noted some progress from Year 8 to Year 9 in the use of the focussed strategies but this was modest at best. The most marked progress was in recognition of the logical necessity of a conclusion of an implication when the antecedent was assumed to be true. Finally we present some theoretical categories to capture different types of meanings students assign to logical implication and the rationale underpinning these meanings. The categories distinguish responses where a statement of logical implication is (or is not)interpreted as equivalent to its converse where the antecedent and consequent are (or are not) seen as interchangeable and where conclusions are (or are not)influenced by specific data. © Kluwer Academic Publishers 2002.","Deduction; Logic; Logical implication; Proof",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543017641

Much of the work in these fields has been focused on a microanalysis of how students use specific representations, such as line graphs and equations, and on the particular difficulties that students have with these representations. Here, in contrast, I will illustrate an approach that attempts to place students' work with representations in the context of the broader history of their representational experience, and the capabilities that this experience engenders. I refer to this approach as ""genetic,"" because it attempts to understand episodes of representational learning within the broader context of the genesis of representational competence. I will illustrate this new program by looking at episodes in which students are engaged in the invention of graphical representations of motion. The heart of my analysis will be the identification of what I call constructive resources, basic and somewhat generic resources that contribute to a student's ability to invent representations of motion. The analysis will include a number of core observations. I will argue for the importance of prior experiences with drawing and that some features of drawings are carried over to representations invented by students. I will describe a type of representation I call a temporal sequence that I believe develops from student experience with notational systems. Finally, I will discuss how students' abilities to make use of certain features of elements of a representational display contribute to their ability to invent novel forms. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

They assume that the algebraic system used by students inherits structural properties associated with the number system with which students are familiar. This study explored this assumption. In an attempt to discover whether wrong interpretations of the algebraic structure found in an algebraic context occur in a purely numerical one, we interviewed 53 sixth-graders individually. The assessment confirms the assumption: students' difficulties with the algebraic structure were found in purely numerical contexts. However, the study also confirms two, seemingly, contradictory observations. On the one hand, the students' interpretations of the structures of the expressions were very consistent; that is, the same tendencies were found in many students' answers. In this sense the students' behaviour was consistent. On the other hand, it was clearly observed that the same student may give an incorrect answer in one context and a correct answer in another.

The major constructs incorporated in this framework were sample space, probability of an event, probability comparisons, and conditional probability. For each of these constructs, four levels of thinking, which reflected a continuum from subjective to numerical reasoning, were established. At each level, and across all four constructs, learning descriptors were developed and used to generate probability tasks. The framework was validated through data obtained from eight grade three children who served as case studies. The thinking of these children was assessed at three points over a school year and analyzed using the problem tasks in interview settings. The results suggest that although the framework produced a coherent picture of children's thinking in probability, there was 'static' in the system which generated inconsistencies within levels of thinking. These inconsistencies were more pronounced following instruction. The levels of thinking in the framework appear to be in agreement with levels of cognitive functioning postulated by Neo-Piagetian theorists and provide a theoretical foundation for designers of curriculum and assessment programs in elementary school probability. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the framework is appropriate for children from other cultural and linguistic backgrounds. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249103360

One of the limitations of imagery found in the literature comes to bear on a unique aspect of mathematics teaching and learning. This is the notion of an uncontrollable image, which may persist, thereby preventing the opening up of more fruitful avenues of thought, a difficulty which is particularly acute if the image is vivid.

This study investigates strategy use and strategy flexibility, as well as their relations with performance in non-routine problem solving. In this context, we propose and investigate two types of strategy flexibility, namely inter-task flexibility (changing strategies across problems) and intra-task flexibility (changing strategies within problems). Data were collected on three non-routine problems from 152 Dutch students in grade 4 (age 9-10) with high mathematics scores. Findings showed that students rarely applied heuristic strategies in solving the problems. Among these strategies, the trial-and-error strategy was found to have a general potential to lead to success. The two types of flexibility were not displayed to a large extent in students' strategic behavior. However, on the one hand, students who showed inter-task strategy flexibility were more successful than students who persevered with the same strategy. On the other hand, contrary to our expectations, intra-task strategy flexibility did not support the students in reaching the correct answer. This stemmed from the construction of an incomplete mental representation of the problems by the students.

Four variables (grade level taught, content area taught, level of support received, and self-efficacy for teaching inquiry) were significantly correlated to two dependent variables, percentage of time that students are engaged in inquiry during a typical lesson and the perceived ideal percentage of instructional time that should be devoted to inquiry. Specifically, elementary school teachers reported using inquiry-based practices more than either middle-school or high-school teachers; similarly, elementary-school teachers believed such practices should be used more often. All groups, however, reported believing in an ideal percentage of time devoted to inquiry instruction that was significantly greater than their reported percentage of time actually spent on inquiry instruction. A disordinal effect was found between grade level taught and content area taught; at the elementary level, science teachers reported both an ideal and actual percentage of time on inquiry higher than those reported by the math teachers, while at the high school level math teachers reported both an ideal and actual percentage of time on inquiry higher than those reported by the science teachers.

Students' multiplicative structures are the units coordinations that they can take as given prior to activity-i.e., the units coordinations that they have interiorized. This research indicates that the construction of improper fractions requires having interiorized three levels of units. Students who have interiorized only two levels of units may operate with fractions greater than one, but they don't produce improper fractions. These findings call for a revision in Steffe's hypothesis (Steffe, L. P. (2002). A new hypothesis concerning children's fractional knowledge. Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 20, 267-307) that upon the construction of the splitting operation, students' fractional schemes can be regarded as essentially including improper fractions.

The study involved an analysis of ninth grade algebra students' written and verbal descriptions of their mathematical problem solving processes. Through this comparison, a better understanding of the connection between problem solving and writing is realized. The written and verbal data show a relationship between the number of problem solving strategies tried by students and their success. The majority of problem solving behaviors involve execution actions such as carrying out goals and performing calculations. Students who construct global plans are more successful problem solvers. Students engage in verification behaviors at various stages of problem solving though the majority of students do not verify their final answers. While both oral and written descriptions serve as a tool for understanding students' thinking processes, a comparison of the two modes of reporting, using a metacognitive framework as the lens of analysis, reveals some important variations. Students who wrote descriptions of their thinking were significantly more successful in the problem solving tasks (p < 0.05) than students who verbalized their thinking. Differences in metacognitive behaviors also support the premise that writing can be an effective tool in supporting metacognitive behaviors.","Communication; Discourse; Metacognition; Problem solving; Writing",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543046786

In problems where numbers intervene, the magnitude of the numbers considered has an effect on their probability: bigger numbers are more likely to be obtained than smaller ones. Many children seem to be unable to solve probability questions, because of their inability to consider the rational structure of a hazard situation: ""chance"" is, by itself, an equalizing factor of probabilities. Positive intuitive capacities have also been identified: some problems referring to compound events are better solved when addressed in a general form than when addressed in a particular way. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009189069

Researchers claim that one reason for these difficulties is that algebra classes often focus on symbol manipulation and procedures above, and many times at the expense of, a more conceptual understanding of the content. Teaching algebra in a more conceptual way, however, can be quite challenging for teachers. This study explores the development of teacher noticing as a way to help teachers learn to broaden their views of algebra, pay attention to a wide range of student algebraic thinking, and reason about students’ ideas in substantive ways. This study takes place in the context of a video club in which seven preservice teachers watched and discussed video excerpts from algebra classes over an 8-week period. A framework for noticing student algebraic thinking was created and used to structure the discussions in the video club. In addition, a new, online video-tagging tool was used to document the development of the teachers’ ability to notice student algebraic thinking. Results suggest that participating in the video club helped teachers more consistently attend to substantive student algebraic thinking and to reason about this thinking they noticed in deeper ways. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Algebra; Professional development; Teacher education; Teaching and learning of algebra; Video clubs",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945472420

While the experimental group received cognitive conflict based physics instruction, control group were taught by traditionally designed physics instruction. The data were obtained through Thermal Concept Evaluation test (TCE). Prior to instruction, students in both groups were pre-tested by TCE in order to determine their initial understanding of heat and temperature at the beginning of instruction. The same tests were applied as posttest after the instruction. Independent samples t-test on pre-test scores showed that there was no statistical significant difference between experimental and control group at the beginning of the instruction in terms of understanding of heat and temperature concepts. ANCOVA results showed that mean scores on the post-TCE of students in experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group.

Through a consideration of elements of theory such as knowledge and inquiry in teaching and of learning as knowledge growth through research/inquiry leading to enhancement of students' learning of mathematics, a framework is suggested. Its purposes include analysis of a research project's contribution to teaching development and conceptualization of research which has teaching development as one of its aims.

In particular, the study suggests that mathematicians build the visual representation in steps which are clearly separated by a few moments, during which they attempt to analyze the visual representation with respect to the problem situation.

This project began as an attempt to explore calculus students' understanding of the chain rule and its applications. Based on the initial description of how the chain rule concept may be learned (genetic decomposition) an attempt to interpret the data using the Action-Process-Object theoretical framework is made. The insufficiency of this alone led to an extension of the Action-Process-Object-Schema epistemological framework (APOS) which includes a theory of schema development based on ideas of Piaget and Garcia. The Piagetian Triad is suggested as a mechanism for describing schema development in general, and the chain rule is used as an example. The Triad of the Intra, Inter and Trans stages of schema development provides the structure for interpreting the students' understanding of the chain rule and classifying their responses to interview questions about the chain rule. The results of this data analysis allowed for a proposed revised epistemological analysis of the chain rule.

The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O'Malley (2005). First, research questions are identified. Second, the last five years in ERIC database is explored by using the search term 'augmented reality.' Third, studies are investigated through inclusion and exclusion criteria, and PRISMA (2009) model is utilized for article selection. Fourth, selected articles are charted with respect to numerous dimensions and summaries. Finally, findings are reported in the light of research questions.

Whereas the U.S. teachers were supportive of both traditional and nontraditional elementary school mathematics instruction and had different scripts for the two lessons, the Japanese teachers had only one ideal lesson script that was closely tied to typical Japanese mathematics instruction.

Following an analysis of the cognitive obstacles involved, this paper reports the results of an alternative approach. We designed an individualized teaching experiment which was tested in six case studies. In the first part the students' natural tendency to group singletons in the unknown within the equations was expanded to a process of grouping like terms. In the second part we introduced a reverse process to grouping like terms, that of decomposition of a term into a sum. This process, combined with the cancellation of identical terms, provides a procedure for the solution of first degree equations with the unknown on both sides of the equality sign. The last part of the teaching experiment involved the decomposition of an additive term into a difference. The first two parts proved very successful and the students developed procedures on their own that were more efficient than the initial ones. The results of the third part, however, revealed the limits of this approach. The students experienced difficulties in choosing the required decomposition.

This longitudinal study compares the development of knowledge and creativity between the experimental and control groups as reflected in students' written tests. Geometry knowledge was measured by the correctness and connectedness of the solutions presented. The criteria for creativity were: fluency, flexibility, and originality. The findings show that students' connectedness as well as their fluency and flexibility benefited from implementation of MSTs. The study supports the idea that originality is a more internal characteristic than fluency and flexibility, and therefore more related with creativity and less dynamic. Nevertheless, the MSTs approach provides greater opportunity for potentially creative students to present their creative products than conventional learning environment. Cluster analysis of the experimental group identified three clusters that correspond to three levels of student performance, according to the five measured criteria in pre- and post-tests, and showed that, with the exception of originality, performance in all three clusters generally improved on the various criteria. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Geometry knowledge; Mathematical creativity; Multiple solution tasks",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155172312

The results indicated that using writing-to-learn strategies was advantageous for students compared to those students working with more traditional science writing approaches. Using diversified types of writing enabled students in treatment groups to score significantly better on conceptual questions and total test scores than those in comparison groups. Importantly, when the cognitive demand of the question is increased from an extended recall to a design type question, there are significant performance differences between comparison and treatment groups in favour of treatment. The authors argue that the use of writing-to-learn strategies requires students to re-represent their knowledge in different forms and, as such, greater learning opportunities exist.

The guiding research questions were (a) What are teachers’ perceptions of SSI and the place of these issues in the science curriculum? and (b) What are some factors that impede or facilitate addressing SSI in Korean secondary classrooms? The factors that were explored included teachers’ perceptions of the necessity of addressing SSI, teachers’ personal science‐teaching efficacy (PSTE) beliefs regarding SSI, and other relevant situational factors. The 86 participants (65% female) completed a questionnaire comprising Likert‐type and open‐ended questions. Next, follow‐up, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with a random sample of 12 participants. Results indicated that participants perceived a need to address SSI positively. However, only a minority dealt with such issues in their classrooms and then only sporadically. Participants had low PSTE beliefs related to teaching about SSI. They perceived the lack of instructional time and the unavailability of relevant materials as the primary obstacles that hindered the teaching of SSI.

This paper describes the results of a study investigating the degree to which teachers' use of instructional practices aligned with these reforms is related to improved student achievement, after controlling for student background characteristics and prior achievement. In particular we focus on the effects of curriculum on the relationship between instructional practices and student outcomes. We collected data on tenth-grade students during the 1997-98 academic year. Some students were enrolled in integrated math courses designed to be consistent with the reforms, whereas others took the more traditional algebra and geometry sequence. Use of instructional practices was measured through a teacher questionnaire, and student achievement was measured using both the multiple-choice and open-ended components of the Stanford achievement tests. Use of standards-based or reform practices was positively related to achievement on both tests for students in integrated math courses, whereas use of reform practices was unrelated to achievement in the more traditional algebra and geometry courses. These results suggest that changes to instructional practices may need to be coupled with changes in curriculum to realize effects on student achievement.","Curriculum; High school, 9-12; Integrated curriculum; Reform in mathematics education; Teaching practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035564541

This study hence focuses not solely on teachers’ noticing, but also on their knowledge and views, which allows insight into how noticing is informed and shaped by professional knowledge. As a discipline-specific perspective for noticing we chose dealing with multiple representations, since they play a double role for learning mathematics: On the one hand they are essential for mathematical understanding, but on the other hand they can also be an obstruction for learning. This comparative study takes into account pre-service as well as in-service teachers in order to explore the role of teaching experience for such professional knowledge, views and noticing. The participants answered a questionnaire addressing different components of specific knowledge and views. For eliciting the teachers’ theme-specific noticing, vignette-based questions were used. The data analysis was done mainly by quantitative methods, but was complemented by a qualitative in-depth analysis focusing on how the teachers’ theme-specific noticing was informed by different components of their professional knowledge. The results suggest that pre-service as well as in-service teachers do not fully understand the key role of multiple representations for learning mathematics in the sense of their discipline-specific significance.

From this perspective, we are compelled to ask how learning of mathematics beyond modeling may occur as students generate and validate mathematical models. We consider a diagrammatic model of mathematical modeling as a process that allows us to identify how mathematical understandings may develop or surface while learners engage in modeling tasks. Through examples from prospective teachers' mathematical modeling work, we illustrate how our diagrammatic model serves as a tool to unpack the intricacies of students' mathematical experience while engaging in modeling tasks. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Learning; Mathematical modeling; Prospective teachers; Theory; Understanding",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748992286

The data shows that although students in these East Asian countries did not talk a lot in the classroom, they were exposed to more instructional content. The mathematics problems they worked on were set up mainly using mathematical language, and compared with the problems solved by students in other countries, the problems took a longer duration to solve and more proof was involved. According to the judgement of an expert panel on the Hong Kong lessons (Japan did not participate in this part of the study), more advanced contents were covered and the lessons were more coherent. The mathematics presentations were more developed, and the students were more likely to be engaged in the lessons. In sum, the overall quality of the teaching in this East Asian country was judged to be high. The findings show that high quality teaching and learning can take place even in a teacher directed classroom. It is argued that these East Asian classroom practices are deeply rooted in the underlying cultural values of the classroom and the wider society. The paper ends by drawing some implications of the study for the mathematics education community in other cultures. © Springer 2005.","Advanced mathematics content; Culture; East Asia; Mathematical language; Quality of teaching; Teacher directed classroom; Teacher talk; Video study",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944432208

This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the 'illusion of linearity'. For example, in geometry it is known that many students believe that if the sides of a figure are doubled, the area is doubled too. In this article, the empirical evidence for this phenomenon is expanded to the domain of probabilistic reasoning. First, we elaborate on the notion of chance and provide some reasons for expecting the overgeneralization of linear models in the domain of probability too. Afterwards, a number of well-known and less-known probabilistic misconceptions are described and analysed, showing that they have one remarkable characteristic in common: they can be interpreted in terms of the improper application of linear relations. Finally, we report on an empirical investigation aimed at identifying the ability of 10 th and 12 th grade students to compare the probabilities of two binomial chance situations. It appears that before instruction in probability, students have a good capability of comparing two events qualitatively, but at the same time they incorrectly quantify this qualitative insight as if the variables in the problem were linked by a linear relationship. Remarkably, these errors persist after instruction in probability. The potential of this study for improving the teaching and learning of probability, as well as suggestions for further research, are discussed.","Illusion of linearity; Misconception; Probability; Ratio and proportion",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843115620

Considering the role that context plays in developing ISI calls into question the need to be more explicit about the reasoning that underpins ISI. This paper uses educational literature on informal statistical inference and philosophical literature on inference to argue that in order for students to generate informal statistical inferences, there are a number of interrelated key elements that are needed to support their informal inferential reasoning. In particular, we claim that ISI is nurtured by statistical knowledge, knowledge about the problem context, and useful norms and habits developed over time, and is supported by an inquiry-based environment (tasks, tools, scaffolds). We adopt Peirce's and Dewey's view that inquiry is a sense-making process driven by doubt and belief, leading to inferences and explanations. To illustrate the roles that these elements play in supporting students to generate informal statistical inferences, we provide an analysis of three sixth-graders' (aged 12) informal inferential reasoning-the reasoning processes leading to their informal statistical inferences. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78951488907

Children worked in pairs on laptop computers, using Flash Macromedia programs with the array representation to carry out multiplication calculations. In using this approach, we were able to record all the actions carried out by children on the computer, using a recording program called Camtasia. The analysis of the obtained audiovisual data identified ways in which the array representation helped children, and also problems that children had with using the array. Based on these results, implications for using the array in the classroom are considered.","Array; Multiplication; Reasoning; Representations; Understanding",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349094954

Consistent with our way of working, we delay definition until after appropriate reader experience has been brought to the surface and several 'examples' have been discussed. Of special interest is the notion of accessibility of examples: an individual's access to example spaces depends on conditions and is a valuable window on a deep, personal, situated structure. Through the notions of dimensions of possible variation and range of permissible change, we consider ways in which examples exemplify and how attention needs to be directed so as to emphasise examplehood (generality) rather than particularity of mathematical objects.

In this paper, we contribute to this debate by illustrating three learning opportunities that group discussions can create. In analyzing a videotaped episode of eight middle school students discussing a statistical problem, we observed that these students frequently challenged the arguments that their colleagues presented. These challenges invited students to be explicit about what mathematical principles, or warrants, they were implicitly using as a basis for their mathematical claims, in some cases recognize the modes of reasoning they were using were invalid and reject these modes of reasoning, and in other cases, attempt to provide deductive support to justify why their modes of reasoning were appropriate.

We are also led to challenge the cause-and-effect model underlying much attitudinal research. We now see attitude as at best a complex notion, and we conjecture that perhaps it is not a quality of an individual but rather a construct of an observer's desire to formulate a story to account for observations. The difficulty in making attitudinal research precise, and in testing the validity of attitudinally based conjectures, lies therefore in conceptual and hence methodological issues. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54649084542

This article discusses and supports the recent claim that Constructivism is an alternative paradigm, that has rich and significant consequences for mathematics education. In the United States there is a growing body of published research that claims to demonstrate the distinct nature of the implications of this view. There are, however, many critics who maintain that this is not the case, and that the research is within the current paradigm of cognitive psychology. The nature and tone of the dispute certainly at times appears to describe a paradigm shift in the Kuhnian model. In an attempt to analyse the meaning of Constructivism as a learning theory, and its implications for mathematics education, the use of the term by the intuitionist philosophers of mathematics is compared and contrasted. In particular, it is proposed that Constructivism in learning theory does not bring with it the same ontological commitment as the Intuitionists' use of the term, and that it is in fact a relativist thesis. Some of the potential consequences for the teaching of mathematics of a relativist view of mathematical knowledge are discussed here. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042238820

This paper presents some initial results from the investigation of recent science graduates' and employers' views of employability skills needs. More specifically, this paper will discuss: (a) whether there is a mismatch between the knowledge and skills developed through undergraduate study and those actually required in post-graduation activities, (b) what knowledge and skills employers view as important when employing graduates in the current and future work climate, and (c) what graduates and employers consider universities can do to better support employment for graduates.","Employer views; Generic skills; Graduate employability; Science graduate views",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009986174

Until recently research has focused on working memory, but studies are beginning to show that inhibition skills—the ability to suppress distracting information and unwanted responses—are also important for mathematics. However, these studies employed general mathematics tests and therefore are unable to pinpoint how inhibition skills relate to specific components of mathematics. We explored how inhibition skills are related to overall achievement as well as factual, procedural and conceptual knowledge in 209 participants aged 11–12, 13–14 and adults. General mathematics achievement was more strongly related to inhibition measured in numerical compared with non-numerical contexts. Inhibition skills were related to conceptual knowledge in older participants, but procedural skills in younger participants. These differing relationships can shed light on the mechanisms by which inhibition is involved in mathematics. © 2015, The Author(s).",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940046380

Drawing on cultural historical activity theory (CHAT), this paper adopts Leont'ev's notion of leading activity in order to explore the key 'significant' activities that are implicated in the development of students' reflexive understanding of self and how this may offer differing relations with mathematics. According to Leont'ev (1981), leading activities are those which are significant to the development of the individual's psyche through the emergence of new motives for engagement. We suggest that alongside new motives for engagement comes a new understanding of self-a leading identity-which reflects a hierarchy of our motives. Narrative analysis of interviews with two students (aged 16-17 years old) in post-compulsory education, Mary and Lee, are presented. Mary holds a stable 'vocational' leading identity throughout her narrative and, thus, her motive for studying mathematics is defined by its 'use value' in terms of pursuing this vocation. In contrast, Lee develops a leading identity which is focused on the activity of studying and becoming a university student. As such, his motive for study is framed in terms of the exchange value of the qualifications he hopes to obtain. We argue that this empirical grounding of leading activity and leading identity offers new insights into students' identity development. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Aspirations; Cultural models; Cultural-historical activity theory; Identity; Leading activity",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-72149086392

We describe learning situations that were the subject of the empirical study, which involved forty students in two 8th-grade classes. The aim was to teach the formal solving method, which involved performing the same operations on both sides of the equation using, notably, the balance model. Analysis of students' reasoning showed that the presence of negative numbers gave rise to many errors. The difficulties presented by negative numbers were reviewed, eight months later, during an interview with five students, chosen from those who took part in the experiment.

In addition, the following kinds of errors were displayed by less than 10% of the subjects: conceiving a generalized, stereotypic idea of a graph, using arrows or stairs to represent the direction of the covariation, and connecting the ticks on the axes by lines or curves.

Expertise research usually uses low-inference measures like eye tracking to identify qualitative difference between expert and novice behaviors and cognition. In this study, we used mobile eye-tracking technology to create a low inference quality indicator for the comparison of experienced and student teachers. The distribution of visual fixations on students was measured using Gini coefficients based on the observation of van den Bogert, van Bruggen, Kostons, and Jochems (Teacher and Teacher Education, 37, 208–216, 2014) that expert teachers show better classroom monitoring. Results confirm that student teachers have a higher Gini coefficient than experienced teachers indicating weaker classroom monitoring. However, the Gini coefficient did not correlate in the predicted way with trained observer coding of video footage of the same classrooms using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) (Pianta, Hamre, Haynes, Mintz, & La Paro, 2007) although the mean differences in behavioral management were higher for the experienced teachers as expected.

The present paper evaluates a model based on students' own creation of knowledge, denoted creative mathematically founded reasoning (CMR), and compare this to a procedure-based model of teaching that is similar to what is commonly found in schools, denoted algorithmic reasoning (AR).

In Indonesia, algebra performance is an important issue. In the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007, Indonesian students’ achievement in the algebra domain was significantly below the average student performance in other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. This fact gave rise to this study which aims to investigate Indonesian students’ difficulties in algebra. In order to do so, a literature study was carried out on students’ difficulties in initial algebra. Next, an individual written test on algebra tasks was administered, followed by interviews. A sample of 51 grade VII Indonesian students worked the written test, and 37 of them were interviewed afterwards. Data analysis revealed that mathematization, i.e., the ability to translate back and forth between the world of the problem situation and the world of mathematics and to reorganize the mathematical system itself, constituted the most frequently observed difficulty in both the written test and the interview data. Other observed difficulties concerned understanding algebraic expressions, applying arithmetic operations in numerical and algebraic expressions, understanding the different meanings of the equal sign, and understanding variables. The consequences of these findings on both task design and further research in algebra education are discussed. © 2014, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Algebra; Difficulties; Indonesian students; Linear equations; Linear inequalities",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907788445

The data of 321 K-11 students (49 % women) were analyzed. Human biology and gene technology was the most interesting topics of biology among the students. The students’ self-efficacy belief was highest in geography and lowest in mathematics. Male students had higher self-efficacy in mathematics and science subjects, but in biology, no gender difference was found. Self-efficacy in biology and geography intercorrelated, as did self-efficacy in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Regression analysis revealed that interest and self-efficacy in biology and positive attitudes to biology as school subjects explained girls’ orientation towards a biology-related career, as did low self-efficacy in physics and geography. For boys, only interest in biology, positive attitudes to biology as a school subject, and self-efficacy in biology explained their biology-related career orientation.

Eye movements of 40 university students were recorded while they were rearranging simple algebraic equations. The participants also reported on their strategies during equation solving in a separate questionnaire. The analysis of the behavioral and eye tracking data, namely the accuracy, reaction times, and the number of fixations, revealed that the participants improved their performance during the time course of the measurement. The type of equation also had a significant effect on the score. The results indicated that the number of fixations represents a reliable and sensitive measure that can give valuable insights into participants' flow of attention during equation solving. A correlation between the number of fixations and participants' efficiency in equation solving was found, suggesting that the more efficient participants developed adequate strategies, i.e. ""knew where to look."" The comparison of eye movement data and questionnaire reports was used for assessing the validity of participants' metacognitive insights. The measures derived from eye movement data were found to be more objective and reliable than the participants' reports.

One would think that a comprehensive theory of decision-making would provide the bases for a classroom observation scheme. It turns out, however, that, although the theoretical and practical enterprise are in many ways overlapping, the theoretical underpinnings for the observation scheme are sufficiently different (narrower in some ways and broader in others) and the constraints of almost real-time implementation so strong that the resulting analytic scheme is in many ways radically different from the theoretical framing that gave rise to it. This essay characterizes and reflects on the evolution of the observational scheme. It provides details of some of the failed attempts along the way, in order to document the complexities of constructing such schemes. It is hoped that the final scheme provided will be of some value, both on theoretical and pragmatic grounds. Finally, the author reflects on the relationships between theoretical and applied research on teacher behavior, and the relevant research methods. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.","Classroom observations; Coding scheme; Decision making; Rubric; Teaching quality",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892897108

It has been reported consistently that it can be hard or take time to establish norms for discussion of video but little has been said about reasons why, or the role of the discussion facilitator. As a starting point in this area, I suggest fives aspects or decision points in the role of the facilitator. Two aspects are taken from the literature and the others are drawn from empirical data, collected as part of an enactivist study into the use of video in one secondary school. At the school, teachers commented on finding video watching in a group more useful than lesson observation, with no evidence of this taking time to develop. I offer speculations, based on enactivist category theory, as to why the use of video in this school is effective. Having presented key aspects of the role of the facilitator of video use, a further look at the detail of the data from discussions serves to highlight some of the complexities involved in just one of the categories (and, by implication, the others). I conclude that the role of the facilitator cannot be separated from a consideration of the historical context in which discussion takes place. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Continuing professional development; Enactivism; Facilitating discussion; Mathematics teacher learning; Video use",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877605284

We claim that the combined ""construction-evaluation"" activity helps illuminate certain aspects of prospective teachers' and presumably other individuals' understanding of proof that tend to defy scrutiny when individuals are asked to evaluate given arguments. For example, some prospective teachers in our study provided empirical arguments to mathematical statements, while being aware that their constructions were invalid. Thus, although these constructions considered alone could have been taken as evidence of an empirical conception of proof, the additional consideration of prospective teachers' evaluations of their own constructions overruled this interpretation and suggested a good understanding of the distinction between proofs and empirical arguments.

This study focuses on the impact of these AHA! experiences on undergraduate mathematics students' affective domain. In particular, the role of the positive emotion that accompanies such moments of illumination in changing the attitudes and beliefs of 'resistant' students is examined. That is, pre-service elementary school teachers who deem themselves to be incapable and/or phobic of mathematics and the learning of mathematics but are forced to take an undergraduate mathematics course as qualification for entry into a teacher education programme.

The analysis describes in detail the impact that interaction with a tutor had on a learner, how the learner appropriated goals, actions, perspectives, and meanings that are part of mathematical practices, and how the learner was active in transforming several of the goals that she appropriated. The paper describes how a learner appropriated two aspects of mathematical practices that are crucial for working with functions (Breidenbach, Dubinsky, Nichols and Hawks, 1992; Even, 1990; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld and Arcavi, 1993; Schwarz and Yerushalmy, 1992; Sfard, 1992): a perspective treating lines as objects and the action of connecting a line to its corresponding equation in the form y = mx + b. I use examples from the analysis of two tutoring sessions to illustrate how the tutor introduced three tasks (estimating y-intercepts, evaluating slopes, and exploring parameters) that reflect these two aspects of mathematical practices in this domain and describe how the student appropriated goals, actions, meanings, and perspectives for carrying out these tasks.

These models of instruction, however, have been criticized for their lack of explicitness. Detailed descriptions of cognitive processes within self-regulated learning (SRL) and attribution theories (e.g., Borkowski et al., 1988; Butler, 2002; Zimmerman, 2000) lend support for and provide examples of explicit instruction embedded within sociocultural models of mathematics instruction. Self-regulated learners are active participants in their own learning, are able to select from a repertoire of strategies and to monitor their progress in using these strategies toward a goal. In this article, we describe the collaborative efforts of a seventh-grade mathematics teacher and a university faculty member to develop students' mathematical thinking and self-regulation within one middle school classroom. We argue that implementing mathematics instruction consonant with NCTM (1989, 2000) standards documents makes the development of self-regulated learners possible and is at the same time dependent upon some degree of self-regulation within the community of practice. Several factors are crucial to this development: multiple representations and rich mathematical tasks; classroom discourse; environmental scaffolding of strategic behavior; and varying needs for explicitness and support. This work constitutes beginning efforts to describe contexts that support the development of mathematical thinking and SRL in the middle school mathematics classroom.","Cognitive processes; Mathematics instruction; Middle school; Self-regulated learning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442634377

Here, we investigated how factors including numerosity ratio, set size and visual cues influence task performance. Forty-four children aged 7–9 years completed a dot comparison task with a range of to-be-compared numerosities. We found that as the size of the numerosities increased, with ratios held constant, accuracy decreased due to the heightened salience of incongruent visual information. Furthermore, in trials with larger numerosities participants’ accuracies were influenced more by the convex hull of the array than the average dot size. The numerosity ratio between the arrays in each trial was an important predictor for all set sizes. We argue that these findings are consistent with a ‘competing processes’ inhibition-based account, where accuracy scores are influenced by individual differences in both ANS acuity and inhibitory control skills. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Approximate Number System; Dot comparison; Inhibition; Numerical cognition; Visual cues",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940039005

We then use the refined theory to analyze strong examples from mathematics education literature as a source of insight into how this theory is being and could be used in the field.

Behaviorists wanted to get rid of it; many researchers prefer other terms like ""conception"" or ""reasoning"" or even ""encoding;"" and many cognitive science resarchers have tried to avoid the problem by reducing thinking to production rules. There are at least two simple and naive reasons for considering representation as an important subject for scientific study. The first one is that we all experience representation as a stream of internal images, gestures and words. The second one is that the words and symbols we use to communicate do not refer directly to reality but to represented entities: objects, properties, relationships, processes, actions, and constructs, about which there is no automatic agreement between two persons. It is the purpose of this paper to analyse this problem, and to try to connect it with an original analysis of the role of action in representation. The issue is important for mathematics education and even for the epistemology of mathematics, as mathematical concepts have their first roots in the action on, and in the representation of, the physical and social world; even though there may be a great distance today between that pragmatical and empirical source, and the sophisticated concepts of contemporary mathematics.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032324612

Our guiding presupposition was that socioscientific issues (SSIs) could be used as an effective pedagogical tool for promoting students’ communication skills by increasing peer interactions, stimulating students’ reasoning, and in constructing shared social knowledge. We implemented a SSI program on gene modification (GM) technology to 132 9th graders in South Korea and investigated to what extent this SSI instruction contributed to enhancing students’ communication skills. Data sources included pre- and post-scores on the Communication Skills Questionnaire (CSQ), semi-structured interviews with the students and instructor, and classroom observations. The results demonstrated that SSI instruction could bring about a moderately large impact on students’ ability to understand the key ideas of others and to value others’ perspectives, as well as a marginal positive effect on developing active assertions. However, SSI instruction appeared to have a lesser impact on students’ ability to develop shared understanding.

The three categories of knowledge-school, advanced, and teaching-build on the work of Ball and others for elementary school teaching and take into account the recommendations of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (2001, 2012) for secondary school teachers' knowledge of post-secondary mathematics. Three categories of teaching practices-trimming, bridging, and decompressing-address mathematical uses of knowledge specific to teaching.

His students learned to establish claims and warrants, construct counterarguments, offer supportive arguments, and provide evidence for each one. Data consisted of student responses to questionnaires and individual follow-up interviews. A multiple regression analysis revealed that success in learning argumentation skills was not substantially related to pre-instruction argumentation skills, but significantly related to the student ability levels. High-ability students were significantly better than low-ability students at generating complete arguments. Most students elaborated their arguments, and more high-ability students offered rebuttals after instruction.

In this paper, we describe results from several interviews with experts to explore strategy flexibility for solving equations. We conducted interviews with eight content experts, where we asked a number of questions about flexibility and also engaged the experts in problem solving. Our analysis indicates that the experts that were interviewed did exhibit strategy flexibility in the domain of linear equation solving, but they did not consistently select the most efficient method for solving a given equation. However, regardless of whether these experts used the best method on a given problem, they nevertheless showed an awareness of and an appreciation of efficient and elegant problem solutions. The experts that we spoke to were capable of making subtle judgments about the most appropriate strategy for a given problem, based on factors including mental and rapid testing of strategies, the problem solver's goals (e.g., efficiency, error-free execution, elegance) and familiarity with a given problem type.

Because we take the view that appreciating structure is powerfully productive, attention to structure should be an essential part of mathematical teaching and learning. This is not to be confused with teaching children mathematical structure. We observe that children from quite early ages are able to appreciate structure to a greater extent than some authors have imagined. Initiating students to appreciate structure implies, of course, that their appreciation of it needs to be cultivated in order to deepen and to become more mature. We first consider some recent research that supports this view and then go on to argue that unless students are encouraged to attend to structure and to engage in structural thinking they will be blocked from thinking productively and deeply about mathematics. We provide several illustrative cases in which structural thinking helps to bridge the mythical chasm between conceptual and procedural approaches to teaching and learning mathematics.

The results of this study also showed that across the four tasks, as the grade level advances, a higher percentage of students in that grade level show evidence of having correct answers. Surprisingly, the overall statistically significant differences across the three grade levels are mainly due to statistically significant differences between fourth and fifth grade students. Between fifth and sixth grade students, there are no statistically significant differences in most of the analyses. Compared to the findings concerning US and Chinese students' mathematical thinking, Singaporean students seem to be much more similar to Chinese students than to US students. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29444457355

Pre- and post-instruction interviews documenting learning and analysis of classroom interactions suggest mechanisms of that learning. I propose that three main factors account for these two students' success: use of tasks that elicited the students' prior understanding, creation of a variety of participant frameworks (Goffman, 1981) in which the students were treated as mathematically competent, and frequency of opportunities for identity-enhancing interactions.","Discourse analysis; Elementary, K-8; Fractions; Learning; Social factors",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844294715

An argument will be given here that defines as 'real mathematics' any activity of participating in a mathematical practice. The acknowledgement of the discursive nature of school practices requires an indepth analysis of the notion of classroom discourse. For a further analysis of this problem Bakhtin's notion of speech genre is used. The genre particularly functions as a means for the interlocutors for evaluating utterances as a legitimate part of an ongoing mathematical discourse. The notion of speech genre brings a cultural historical dimension in the discourse that is supposed to be acted out by the teacher who demonstrates the tools, rules, and norms that are passed on by a mathematical community. This has several consequences for the role of the teacher. His or her mathematical attitude acts out tendencies emerging from the history of the mathematical community (like systemacy, non-contradiction etc.) that subsequently can be imitated and appropriated by pupils in a discourse. Mathematical attitude is the link between the cultural historical dimension of mathematical practices and individual mathematical thinking. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Activity; Attitude; Discourse; Genre; Participation; Tool",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0043176077

Such discursive construction is observed in analysis of one classroom episode.

This study sought to examine the relationships among attitude towards mathematics, ability and mathematical achievement. This examination was also supported by a focus on gender effects. By drawing on a sample of Australian secondary school students, it was demonstrated through the results of a multivariate analysis of variance that females were more likely to hold positive attitudes towards mathematics. In addition, the predictive capacity of prior achievement and attitudes towards mathematics on a nationally recognised secondary school mathematics examination was shown to be large (R2 = 0.692). However, when these predictors were controlled, the influence of gender was non-significant. Moreover, a structural equation model was developed from the same measures and subsequent testing indicated that the model offered a reasonable fit of the data. The positing and testing of this model signifies growth in the Australian research literature by showing the contribution that ability (as measured by standardised test results in numeracy and literacy) and attitude towards mathematics play in explaining mathematical achievement in secondary school. The implications of these results for teachers, parents and other researchers are then considered. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.","achievement; attitudes; gender issues; mathematics; structural equation modelling",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955636962

Therefore, it has become clear that, in addition to enriching preservice teachers' (PSTs) knowledge, teacher education programs should also create opportunities for prospective teachers to develop productive beliefs and attitudes toward teaching and learning mathematics. This study explored the effectiveness of a mathematics preparatory program based on the history of mathematics that aimed at enhancing PSTs' epistemological and efficacy beliefs and their attitudes toward mathematics. Using data from a questionnaire administered four times, the study traced the development of 94 PSTs' beliefs and attitudes over a period of 2 years. The analysis of these data showed changes in certain dimensions of the PSTs' beliefs and attitudes; however, other dimensions were found to change in the opposite direction to that expected. Differences were also found in the development of the PSTs' beliefs and attitudes according to their mathematical background.

Most of the students and teachers in the two schools positively appraised teaching and learning with the developed materials. Since the teachers were actively involved in developing the materials, they felt a sense of ownership and recognised that their students' classroom experiences of the materials helped them avoid standard difficulties. That appears to be a particular benefit of the bottom-up approach characteristic of the PMRI movement. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.","Dissemination; Pedagogy; Realistic mathematics education; Sustainability; Teacher learning",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867411095

The subject of authority is particularly important in mathematics education, on the one hand, because of the immense authority mathematics itself seems to possess and pass on to its practitioners, but also, on the other hand, because of the anti-authoritarianism present, to some degree, in many trends in mathematics education such as cooperative learning approaches and constructivist pedagogies. Such an anti-authoritarian stance appears justified by data from an 8th grade mathematics classroom (supplemented with data from a second 8th grade classroom) which suggest that teachers possess immense authority in the eyes of the students and that this and other authority relations are strongly evident in the students' non-reflective ways of interacting not only with their teachers but also among themselves. However, theoretical considerations on authority show that the problem may not be authority per se but the way one conceives the notion of authority, that there exist kinds of authority, such as Benne's 'anthropogogical' authority, which can encourage reflective and also fruitful collaborative work. © Springer 2005.","'Anthropogogical' authority; Learners' perspective study (LPS); Mathematical classroom authority; Reflective mathematical interaction; Sociological perspectives",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144365446

The analysis invokes theoretical notions of didactical contract and double bind to uncover and explain conflicting demands that the practice of assigning two-column proofs imposes on high school teachers. Two aspects of the work of teaching-what teachers do to create a task in which students can produce a proof and what teachers do to get students to prove a proposition - are the focus of the analysis of the episode. This analysis supports the argument that the traditional custom of engaging students in doing formal, two-column proofs places contradictory demands on the teacher regarding how the ideas for a proof will be developed. Recognizing these contradictory demands clarifies why the teacher in the analyzed episode ends up suggesting the key ideas for the proof. The analysis, coupled with current recommendations about the role of proof in school mathematics, suggests that it is advantageous for teachers to avoid treating proof only as a formal process.","Classroom interaction; Communication; Geometry; Knowledge; Proof; Teaching practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036016398

We draw from her interactions with children around fraction story problems in both one-on-one interviews and class lessons. The framework identifies categoriesof teaching moves, rather than specific comments or questions, because how teachers enact a category depends on the situation. We discuss four major categories of teaching moves: (a) ensuring the child is making sense of the story problem, (b) exploring details of the child’s existing strategy, (c) encouraging the child to consider other strategies, and (d) connecting the child’s thinking to symbolic notation. Our findings also highlight both the potential usefulness of one-on-one interviews for professional developers and researchers and the need for increased attention to the part of class lessons in which teachers circulate and engage in one-on-one conversations with children. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Children’s thinking; Elementary school; Fractions; Responsive teaching; Teacher learning; Teaching practices",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962788982

The analysis is based on the year 10 (age, 15 years) responses of 5,034 students from 137 England schools as learners of physics during the academic year 2008-2009. Factor analyses uncovered a range of physics-specific constructs, 7 of which were statistically significantly associated with intention to study physics post-16 in our final multi-level model; in descending order of effect size, these are extrinsic material gain motivation, intrinsic value of physics, home support for achievement in physics, emotional response to physics lessons, perceptions of physics lessons, physics self-concept and advice-pressure to study physics. A further analysis using individual items from the survey rather than constructs (aggregates of items) supported the finding that extrinsic motivation in physics was the most important factor associated with intended participation. In addition, this item-level analysis indicated that, within the advice-pressure to study physics construct, the encouragement individual students receive from their teachers is the key factor that encourages them to intend to continue with physics post-16. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","attitudes; gender; methodology; motivation; physics; science",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899441958

Because stance bundles communicate personal feelings, attitudes and values, we noted the importance of positioning in mathematics classrooms. In this article, we interpret the stance bundles as they relate to authority in mathematics classrooms by organizing them into groups that relate to the ways in which students are assumed to have choice in the discourse and to have obligations. Gradations of obligation and choice are important because they can help mathematics educators think about the ways in which they might open up or close down discourse in the classroom. We argue that it is important for university researchers, classroom teachers, and even mathematics students to engage in conversations about issues of authority, as they relate to developing mathematical understanding in their classroom discourse. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Appraisal linguistics; Authority; Collocation; Concordance; Corpus linguistics; Critical discourse analysis; Lexical bundle; Mathematics education; Positioning; Socio-cultural; Stance bundle; Systemic functional linguistics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955816989

These clusters were based on the objects, relationships, and logic related to intuitions about (a) a collapse in dimension, (b) approximation and error analyses, (c) proximity in a space of point-locations, (d) a small physical scale beyond which nothing exists, and (e) the treatment of infinity as a number.

The introduced concepts of self-system and self-system process stress the importance of self-appraisals of personal competence and agency in affective responses and self-regulation in problem solving. Students are viewed as agents who constantly interpret and evaluate their experiences and regulate their behaviour, in interaction with their mathematics learning environment. This perspective is used to interpret two data sets: Finnish secondary school students' questionnaire responses and their mathematics achievement, and Frank's problem solving episode. The former study examines statistical relations between self-confidence, positive and negative affective responses, self-regulatory patterns, and math performance. The latter focuses on Frank's appraisals and self-regulatory processes with his affective responses while problem solving.

We first argue that when one is validating a proof, it is not sufficient to make certain that each statement in the argument is true. One must also check that there is good reason to believe that each statement follows from the preceding statements or from other accepted knowledge, i.e., that there is a valid warrant for making that statement in the context of this argument. We then report an exploratory study in which we investigated the behavior of 13 undergraduates when they were asked to determine whether or not a particular flawed mathematical argument is a valid mathematical proof. The last line of this purported proof was true, but did not follow legitimately from the earlier assertions in the proof. Our findings were that only six of these undergraduates recognized that this argument was invalid and only two did so for legitimate mathematical reasons. On a more positive note, when asked to consider whether the last line of the proof followed from previous assertions, a total of 10 students concluded that the statement did not and rejected the proof as invalid. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The case of a high school algebra teacher who learned to notice the mathematical strengths of students from marginalized groups is used to illustrate how this might be done. The teacher’s noticing involved not only cognitive processes like attending to, interpreting, and deciding how to respond to students’ thinking, but also managing dominant ideologies that position students—especially students from non-dominant communities—as mathematically deficient rather than as sense-makers whose ideas should form the basis for further learning.

Building on the international IEA Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) and its follow-up study, TEDS-FU, the paper compares cognitive and situated approaches on professional competencies of teachers. In TEDS-FU, the cognitive oriented framework of TEDS-M has been enriched by a situated orientation including the novice-expert framework and the noticing concept as theoretical approaches on the analyses of classroom situations. Correspondingly, the evaluation instruments were extended by using video vignettes for assessing teachers’ perception, interpretation, and decision-making competencies in addition to cognitive oriented knowledge tests. The paper discusses the different kinds of theoretical frameworks and the consequences for the evaluation methods, the strengths, and weaknesses of both approaches. Furthermore, connecting the results of TEDS-FU with TEDS-M allows comprehensive insight into the structure and development of the professional competencies of mathematics teachers, the complex interplay between the different facets of teachers’ competencies, and the high relevance of teaching practice for the development of these competencies. The analyses show on the one hand that both approaches—cognitive and situated—are needed for a comprehensive description of teachers’ professional competencies. On the other hand, it is shown that both approaches can be integrated in a productive way.

This cross-sectional study investigated the natural number bias in first and fifth year secondary school students. Relying on dual process theory assumptions that differentiate between intuitive and analytic processes, we measured accuracies and reaction times on fraction comparison tasks. Half of the items were congruent (i.e., natural number knowledge leads to correct answers), the other half were incongruent (i.e., natural number knowledge leads to incorrect answers). Against expectations, students hardly made errors on incongruent items. Longer reaction times on correctly solved incongruent than on correctly solved congruent items indicated that students were indeed hampered by their prior knowledge about natural numbers, but could suppress their intuitive answers. © 2013 Copyright British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.","dual process theory; fractions; natural number bias; reaction time study",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879643447

However, the number of lessons devoted to the topic is similar in the two curricula. In contrast, division of fractions is developed at about the same time in both curricula, but due to different beliefs about the importance of the topic, KM contains five times as many lessons and about eight times as many problems about division of fractions as EM. Both curricula provide opportunities to develop conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. However, in EM, conceptual understanding is developed first followed by procedural fluency, whereas in KM, they are developed simultaneously. The majority of fraction multiplication and division problems in both curricula requires only procedural knowledge. However, multistep computational problems are more common in KM than in EM, and the response types are also more varied in KM. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Division of fractions; Multiplication of fractions; Reform curriculum; Textbook analysis",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952090882

Teachers who had participated in professional development were found to be more confident in using technology and more convinced of its benefits in supporting students' learning of mathematics. Experienced, specialist mathematics teachers in large metropolitan schools were more likely than others to have attended technology-related professional development, with lack of time and limited access to resources acting as hindrances to many.

My commentary draws on the papers contained in this ZDM issue and is divided into three parts. In the first part, following semiotician Yuri Lotman, I suggest that a network of theories can be conceived of as a semiosphere, i.e., a space of encounter of various languages and intellectual traditions. I argue that such a networking space revolves around two different and complementary ""themes""-integration and differentiation. In the second part, I advocate conceptualizing theories in mathematics education as triplets formed by a system of theoretical principles, a methodology, and templates of research questions, and attempt to show that this tripartite view of theories provides us with a morphology of theories for investigating differences and potential connections. In the third part of the article, I discuss some examples of networking theories. The investigation of limits of connectivity leads me to talk about the boundary of a theory, which I suggest defining as the ""limit"" of what a theory can legitimately predicate about its objects of discourse; beyond such an edge, the theory conflicts with its own principles. I conclude with some implications of networking theories for the advancement of mathematics education. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951960546

Second, individual, institutional, and systemic factors are modeled that may influence the acquisition of this competence during teacher education.

Often good teaching is situated in the context of broader educational goals, such as preparing literate citizenry. Researchers generally define good teaching implicitly with attention to various processes such as reasoning and problem solving. In a series of three interviews, we examined nine experienced and professionally active teachers' views of good mathematics teaching and how it develops. The interviews were couched in the context of the teachers mentoring student teachers. In general, these teachers thought good teaching requires a sound knowledge of mathematics, promotes mathematical understanding, engages and motivates students, and requires effective management skills. Furthermore, the teachers felt that good teaching is developed from experience, education, personal reading and reflection, and interaction with colleagues. Experience was considered the primary contributor.

The case study begins on the 29th of November of their 5th-Grade in school and ends on the 5th of April of the same school year. Two basic problems were of interest in the case study. The first was to provide an analysis of the concepts and operations that are involved in the construction of three fractional schemes: a commensurate fractional scheme, a fractional composition scheme, and a fractional adding scheme. The second was to provide an analysis of the contribution of interactive mathematical activity in the construction of these schemes. The phrase, ""commensurate factional scheme"" refers to the concepts and operations that are involved in transforming a given fraction into another fraction that are both measures of an identical quantity. Likewise, ""fractional composition scheme"" refers to the concepts and operations that are involved in finding how much, say, 1/3 of 1/4 of a quantity is of the whole quantity, and ""fractional adding scheme"" refers to the concepts and operations involved in finding how much, say, 1/3 of a quantity joined to 1/4 of a quantity is of the whole quantity. Critical protocols were abstracted from the teaching episodes with the two children that illustrate what is meant by the schemes, changes in the children's concepts and operations, and the interactive mathematical activity that was involved. The body of the case study consists of an on-going analysis of the children's interactive mathematical activity and changes in that activity. The last section of the case study consists of an analysis of the constitutive aspects of the children's constructive activity, including the role of social interaction and nonverbal interactions of the children with each other and with the computer software we used in teaching the children. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

He described the construction of a new kind of number sequence that we refer to as a connected number sequence (CNS). A CNS can result from the application of a child's explicitly nested number sequence, ENS (Steffe, L. P. (1992). Learning and Individual Differences, 4(3), 259-309; Steffe, L.P. (1994).

It requires the child to incorporate a notion of unit length into the abstract unit items of their ENS. Connected numbers were instantiated by the children within the context of making number-sticks using the computer tool TIMA: sticks. Steffe conjectured that children who had constructed a CNS might be able to use their multiplying schemes to construct composite unit fractions. (In the context of number-sticks a composite unit fraction could be a 3-stick as 1/8 of a 24-stick.) In the case of Jason and Laura, his conjecture was not confirmed. Steffe attributed the constraints that Jason and Laura experienced as possibly stemming from their lack of a splitting operation for composite units. In this paper we shall demonstrate, using the case study of Joe, how a child might construct the splitting operation for composite units, and how such a child was able to not only confirm Steffe's conjecture concerning composite unit fractions, but also give support to our reorganization hypothesis by constructing an iterative fractional scheme (and consequently, a fractional connected number sequence (FCNS)) as a reorganization of his ENS. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Both tests showed significant differences between the samples; on average, the Bristol students were ahead of the Columbus students by the equivalent of 3 years of development, and a similar gap separated the Columbus and Kingston students. Also, significant differences between the two sexes were found on both tests in the Kingston sample and on the drawing test in the Bristol sample. In discussion, it is suggested that the observed differences in spatial and drawing ability reflect cross-cultural differences in attitude toward the use of spatial models in thinking, an attitude which is partly revealed by the degrce of geometrical emphasis in the school mathematics curriculum.

The main lesson in our opinion concerns the growing awareness that students' mathematical thinking is deeply affected by their work with technology in a complex and subtle way. Theories on instrumentation and orchestration make explicit this subtlety and help to design and realise technology-rich mathematics education. As a conclusion, extrapolation of these lessons to a future with mobile multi-functional handheld technology leads to the issues of connectivity and in- and out-of-school collaborative work as major issues for future research. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2010.","Handheld technology; Instrumentalisation; Instrumentation; Mathematics education; Orchestration",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052020545

Students' prior knowledge, beliefs, values, and attitudes might affect their understandings about and actions toward the environment. This study explored the cultural influences on children's self-reported environmental behaviors, perceptions, and understandings; investigated the differences between two culturally distinct groups; and developed models of children's responsible environmental behavior. English and Mandarin questionnaires developed with reasonable validity and reliability were used to collect data regarding children's environmental behaviors, attitudes, concerns, emotional dispositions, knowledge, and situational factors causing children's irresponsible behavior. Useable data collected from 278 grade 5 children from Victoria, BC, Canada, and 483 grade 5 children from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and multiple regression analyses. The results revealed more similarities than differences with small to moderate effect sizes within and between these Canadian and Taiwanese children. Television was the most popular source of environmental information for both groups of children. Canadian children had much more variety and frequency of nature activities than Taiwanese children. Children from both countries expressed positive environmental behavior, positive attitudes toward the environment, high concern about the environmental problems, high emotional disposition toward current environmental situations, and moderate environmental knowledge. The original model of children's responsible environmental behavior did not fully reflect these Canadian and Taiwanese data; therefore, alternative models were developed. Affective variables appear to be stronger influences on children's responsible environmental behavior than the cognitive variable. © 2004 National Science Council, Taiwan.","And behaviors; Children's perceptions; Comparative study; Environmental education; Understandings",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644440843

As a consequence, student teachers should be prepared carefully to learn how to teach this difficult issue. This article presents a naturalistic case study of the development of eight student teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of the multiple meanings of chemistry topics. The student teachers (all M.Sc.) participated in a teacher education program of which the initial phase focused on learning from teaching instead of learning of teaching. They were asked individually to choose and teach a chemistry curriculum topic with a focus on the macro-micro-symbolic issue. Research data were obtained by interviewing the student teachers individually before and after the lessons. The outcomes indicated a development of student teachers' knowledge of teaching difficulties, for instance, too fast and mainly implicit reasoning between macro- and micro-meaning, and a dominant orientation towards the micro-meaning of topics. A development of knowledge of students' difficulties was also indicated, for instance, difficulties in understanding the macro- and micro-meaning of reaction equations.

Our theoretical perspective draws primarily on Vygotsky (1978, 1986) and Bakhtin (1981, 1986) each of whom examines how social forms of meaning influence individual cognition. The episode described in this paper examines the process whereby individual and group developmental trajectories are constructed, and allows us to explore the relationship between discourse and knowing. We combine a longitudinal design with a case study approach to focus on the collaborative mathematical problem solving. We use video capture to help us listen to children's discussions in classroom activities and small group interactions. Our analysis of the verbal data recorded on video identifies patterns of interaction, development and change in participants' use of mathematical language and concepts, and their evolving understanding, through discussion and argument, of an algebraic expression constructed by one of the children. The findings lead us to argue for i) a more generative view of the zone of proximal development as a site of learning and of identity formation, ii) an expanded view of the role of the teacher in inquiry classrooms, and iii) an appreciation for the valuable roles difference and resistance play in knowledge building. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Algebraic thinking; Bakhtin; Collaborative problem solving; Dialogic inquiry; Vygotsky; ZPD",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012592075

Exploratory interviews to discover existing conceptions and difficulties and to discover how pupils made use of diagrams, simpler numbers, and strategies. These interviews exposed difficulties with the understanding of place value, the effect of multiplying and dividing by a positive number less than one, the symbolisms of division and its noncommutative nature, the units associated with the numbers and also with familiar names for the operations. The three strategies were all found to be unfamiliar to pupils and their difficulties are discussed. 2. The design and administration of a diagnostic test, based on the results of these interviews, to a class of less able 14 year olds. 3. The preparation and use of calculator enriched teaching materials designed to remedy the identified misconceptions. From the pre- and post-test results we note the dramatic success of the teaching in improving pupils' understanding of place value, although there is a more modest improvement in enabling pupils to choose the correct operation by drawing diagrams, using easier numbers and estimating. © 1981 D.

These challenges, among them rapid science and technological changes, a rise of information technology use, and continuing movement towards a knowledge-based society all highlight the need for deep education in science including biology, chemistry, environmental science, physics, and sustainability. In fact, the impact of teacher characteristics of self-efficacy level is important for science education and students' learning outcomes in science. In an effort to highlight this, this study investigated the impacts of teacher efficacy and motivation on students' academic achievement in science education in secondary and high schools located in Iran and Russia using motivation for academic performance scale (α = 0.89) and teacher self-efficacy scale (α = 0.91) as measuring instruments and achievement test in science education. Two hypotheses were tested using the statistical programme. For evaluating the demographical differences of the students in terms of their academic achievement, comparative analyses were performed using t-test. Results showed that gender difference was not significant but nationality difference was significant in terms of students' academic achievement in science education. Also other findings reported significant impact of teacher self-efficacy and motivation on academic achievement in science education. Implications, suggestions and recommendations for students, teachers, school administrators, parents, government, education counselors, etc. were discussed and presented. © 2018 by the authors.","Academic achievement; Learning motivation; Learning outcome; Science education; Teacher self-efficacy",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046415166

The notions of this practices' system, onto-semiotic configuration, didactical configuration, normative dimension, and didactical suitability, are introduced in this theoretical system as analytical tools of mathematical and didactical practices. These tools are used as a basis to define five sub-competencies within the mathematics' teacher general competence of didactic analysis and intervention. Investigations are being carried out with this theoretical framework that articulates knowledge and competencies, and support the relevance and possibility that the teacher knows, understands and is able to apply the tools of analysis.

One barrier to the inclusion of mathematical problem solving in assessment is that the skills involved are difficult to define and assess objectively. We present two studies that test a method called comparative judgement (CJ) that might be well suited to assessing mathematical problem solving. CJ is an alternative to traditional scoring that is based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than item-by-item scoring schemes. In study 1, we used CJ to assess traditional mathematics tests and found it performed validly and reliably. In study 2, we used CJ to assess mathematical problem-solving tasks and again found it performed validly and reliably.

The connections between the participants' reasoning, their teaching response, and their beliefs about mathematics teaching were investigated. We found that there were not only differences but also similarities between the prospective elementary and secondary teachers' reasoning and responses. We also found that those who unpacked the mathematical underpinning of the student's non-traditional strategy tended to use what we call ""teacher-focused"" responses, whereas those doing less analysis work tended to construct ""student-focused"" responses.

Two small groups of Grade 9 students are investigated through a four-dimensional analysis: video, audio, transcripts, and written material. The resulting qualitative analysis shows how discourse, gestures, actions, and rhythms orchestrate one another and how, through a complex and subtle coordination of them, the students objectify different aspects of their spatial-temporal mathematical experience. The analysis also suggests connections between the syntax of the students' algebraic formulas and the semiotic means of objectification through which the formulas were forged, thereby shedding some light on the meaning of students' algebraic expression.

Success in this goal depends highly on teachers' knowledge of proof, but limited research has examined this knowledge. This paper contributes to this domain of research by investigating preservice elementary and secondary school mathematics teachers' knowledge of proof by mathematical induction. This research can inform the knowledge about preservice teachers that mathematics teacher educators need in order to effectively teach proof to preservice teachers. Our analysis is based on written responses of 95 participants to specially developed tasks and on semi-structured interviews with 11 of them. The findings show that preservice teachers from both groups have difficulties that center around: (1) the essence of the base step of the induction method; (2) the meaning associated with the inductive step in proving the implication P(k) → P (k + 1) for an arbitrary k in the domain of discourse of P(n); and (3) the possibility of the truth set of a sentence in a statement proved by mathematical induction to include values outside its domain of discourse. The difficulties about the base and inductive steps are more salient among preservice elementary than secondary school teachers, but the difficulties about whether proofs by induction should be as encompassing as they could be are equally important for both groups.

When building the questionnaire, we also considered the combinatorial operation and the nature of elements as task variables. The analysis of variance of the answers from 720 14-15 year-old pupils showed the influence of the implicit combinatorial model on problem difficulty and the interaction of all the factors with instruction. Qualitative analysis also revealed the dependence of error types on task variables. Consequently, the implicit combinatorial model should be considered as a didactic variable in organising elementary combinatorics teaching. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344562556

Close observation of the children's actions and utterances have led to formulations that provide a description of children's cognitive development with respect to counting (Gelman, 1972; Schaeffer, Eggleston and Scott, 1974; Steffe, Von Glasserfeld, Richards and Cobb, 1983) and to addition and subtraction (Carpenter, Moser and Romberg, 1982; Fuson, 1984; Baroody, 1984) This paper presents an analysis of children's solution strategies for multiplication tasks. Consideration is also given to the difficulties experienced by unsuccessful children. This study looks at the development of understanding of multiplication from the early school years, before its formal introduction in school, through to the top primary age group. Concrete tasks based on different aspects of multiplication were presented to 152 children in individual interviews. The children's behaviours were observed and successful solution strategies were analysed to reveal a development from unitary counting, through rhythmic counting in groups to the application of a single multiplication fact. Progressive abstraction in the observed procedures is related to the children's developing understanding of number and to their procedures for addition. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142247651

The authors analyzed the internet addiction problem among students (14-19 years) from the standpoint of the social health of the individuals and society as a whole. In a pilot study, which involved more than 600 adolescent participants aged 14-19 years (secondary school, college and university students), the authors have defined internet addiction as a complex phenomenon. The prerequisites of its development identify and highlights its formation in stages among students (mild fascination, passion, addiction, attachment). At the ascertaining stage of the experiment, a screening study was carried out to examine the state of internet addiction in young students in social networks. The results showed the necessity to design and implement internet addiction prevention programs for young students, which include three main blocks (motivational and cognitive, practice-oriented, reflexive), and a systematic plan for its implementation in the educational space framework. The stages of the experiment provided evidence of the authors' proposed effectiveness of methodologies for young people aged 14-19 years.

The investigation draws on a cultural-historical theory of teaching and learning-the theory of objectification. Within this theory, thinking is conceived of as a form of reflection and action that is simultaneously material and ideal: It includes inner and outer speech, sensuous forms of imagination and visualisation, gestures, rhythm, and their intertwinement with material culture (symbols, artifacts, etc.). The theory articulates a cultural view of development as an unfolding dialectic process between culturally and historically constituted forms of mathematical knowing and semiotically mediated classroom activity. Looking at the experimental data through these theoretical lenses reveals a developmental path where embodied forms of thinking are sublated or subsumed into more sophisticated ones through the mediation of properly designed classroom activity. © 2013 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Algebraic thinking; Development; Embodied thinking; Objectification; Semiotics; Vygotsky",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901634927

This study demonstrates how mathematical identities can shift in dramatic ways in response to minor changes in context so that a student might be, in one moment, engaged in an identity that undermines learning and then later engaged in an academically productive identity.

Nevertheless, mathematics textbook research as a field of research is still at an early stage of development, and its philosophical foundations, theoretical frameworks and research methods for disciplined inquiry are still lacking or fundamentally underdeveloped. To this end, by drawing on the literature and the author's own work, this paper provides a critical analysis of contemporary issues and methods for mathematics textbook research. Based on the analysis, the paper puts forward a conceptual framework which conceptualizes textbooks as an intermediate variable in the context of education and hence defines mathematics textbook research as disciplined inquiry into issues about mathematics textbooks and the relationships between mathematics textbooks and other factors in mathematics education. The paper argues that researchers need to expand research issues from descriptive issues such as how a special topic is treated in textbooks to correlational issues and, especially, causal issues including how they are affected by other factors and how they affect other factors concerning education. For this purpose, researchers must also go beyond textbook analysis, textbook comparison and textbook use to a new and shifted paradigm of research that employs more empirical and experimental methods and view more rigorously textbook research as scientific research. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.","Kuhn's paradigm shift; Mathematics textbooks; Research issues; Research methods; Scientific research; Textbook research",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884126219

The secondary aim of the study was to detect whether misconceptions vary according to gender, educational level, and culture. The study was conducted with 79 student-teachers attending to one of the largest faculties of education in Turkey. Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was used to diagnose student-teachers' misconceptions. FCI is a conceptual test consisting of 29 multiple choice items. Each wrong choice for each question reflects a specific misconception about the force and motion concepts. Data from the study was analyzed by using frequencies, t-test, and ANOVA for making comparisons according to gender and years of education. Results of the study showed that student-teachers of physics hold very strong misconceptions about impetus and active force. No significant differences were found between male and female students' scores on the concept test. The results also showed that misconceptions about force and motion decreased through the years of education. However, they did not disappear completely. Findings of the study are very similar to the other research findings conducted on the subject in other countries. Student-teachers' conceptions about Newton's Third Law, on the other hand, were significantly better than those observed in other research done in other countries such as the US and Finland. © 2008 National Science Council, Taiwan.","Force and motion; Misconceptions; Pre-service teachers; Science education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849084150

The purpose of the research reported here was to assess homework practices in the home, and to examine interactions between mothers and their 5th grade children as they worked challenging mathematics problems (pre-algebra equivalence problems). Results indicated that children spent on average 23 min per day on mathematics homework, with an average of 8 min of help from parents. Videotapes of mother-child interactions indicated that mothers varied considerably in the quality of the mathematics content that they conveyed while teaching, and in the quality of their scaffolding of the material for the child. As expected, mothers who themselves had more mathematics preparation performed better in conveying mathematical content and in scaffolding. Mothers with more mathematics self-confidence also performed better. The results suggest that children face inequities in the parental resources available to them for math learning; these inequities might be remedied by school-family partnership programs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, students' ubiquitous algebra errors have been taken as indicating the need to embed algebra in rich contextual settings (Kaput, 1995; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] Algebra Working Group, 1998). This study explored a nonrepresentational account of symbolic algebra skills as feature correlation within the visual field. We present evidence that algebra students respond spontaneously to the visual patterns of the notational display apart from engagement with the declarative content of the rules. Thus, persistent algebra errors may reflect disengagement from declarative content rather than an inability to deal with it. We sketch a Lexical Support System designed to sustain students' engagement with the declarative content of algebraic rules and processes, thus complementing the exciting curricular possibilities being developed for referentially rich algebra.","Algebra; Cognitive theory; Epistemology; Language and mathematics; Logic and proof; Oral communication; Reform in mathematics education; Spatial visualization",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042818128

In this paper, we conjecture that the challenge of generating integrated STEM curriculum units that overcome this limitation and facilitate in-depth learning of and about STEM can be met by the use of three types of big ideas: within-discipline big ideas that have application in other STEM disciplines, cross-discipline big ideas, and encompassing big ideas. We provide a six-component framework (together with an example of the framework in action) that can be used to scaffold pre- and in-service teachers’ development of integrated STEM curriculum units based around these types of big ideas.

Therefore, students should be given opportunities in their science classes to be engaged in learning experiences that promote SL and CT, which may trigger the need to build and develop knowledge, attitudes/values, thinking abilities, and standards/criteria in an integrated way, resulting in their ability to know how to take responsible action in contexts and situations of personal and social relevance. This paper reports on a study to design, implement, and assess science learning experiences focused on CT toward SL goal. Results support the conclusion that the learning experiences developed and implemented in a grade 6 science classroom had a significant influence on the students’ CT and SL.

The main results are that there is little or no consistency in the conceptualization and nomination of subject-specific aspects. We therefore structured these different aspects along two perspectives, a mathematical perspective on mathematics educational quality of instruction as well as a pedagogical perspective. Furthermore, referring to the usage of these observational instruments in the field, in this paper we inquire into methodological challenges in measuring instructional quality in mathematics classrooms, e.g., the optimal number of raters and lessons to be observed. The results are twofold: on the one hand, there are recent studies that provide a useful answer to these questions. On the other hand, these results appear to be specific to the given data.

Research findings of 47 studies that meet the criteria for meta-analysis are included in the meta-analysis of the study to determine the effects of problem-based learning on students’ attitudes as compared to traditional teaching. Also, some mediator variables are as follows: the status of a study, application time, education levels, scientific field of application, and sample size. As a result of the analysis, it has been found that problem-based learning has a low positive effect on students’ attitudes.

Utilizing the constructs of core practices and the professional noticing as lenses with which to examine the development of preservice teachers' questioning practice, we conducted a case study of 1 pair of preservice teachers as they performed weekly formative assessment interviews to elicit student thinking during 1 semester. Our study was driven by the following research questions: (1) How do preservice teachers develop their questioning practice and ability to notice students' thinking about mathematical and science concepts? (2) How can these questioning practices be further developed? Results suggest that with weekly practice and reflection, preservice teachers can develop their questioning practice within the context of face-to-face interaction with students and that the ways they question students can change when given opportunities to interact with them and analyze their thinking. By having participants attend to what they were professionally noticing about students' thinking, we contend that they learned to adapt their questioning techniques to ask students more competent questions. Participants also exhibited 2 areas of questioning practice ripe for improvement-asking leading questions and missed opportunities to probe students' thinking. While providing clinical field experiences to preservice teachers is not novel, we suggest the importance of foregrounding practices that elicit student mathematical and scientific thinking through an iterative process of enactment and reflection to develop questioning practice and the ability to notice. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","core practices; formative assessment; preservice teacher education; professional noticing; questioning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899423804

Within these transformations, the passage between successive phases of the problem-solving process determines four operational categories: decoding (transposing the text into more explicit relations among the data and the operating schemes, induced by the constraints of the problem), representing (transposing the problem via a generated mental model), processing (identifying an associated mathematical model based on the mental configurations suggested by the problem and own mathematical competence), and implementing (applying identified mathematical techniques to the particular situation of the problem, with the purpose of drafting a conventional solution).

In the particular domain of logical thinking, there is the belief that students have less difficulty reasoning in verbal than in logically equivalent symbolic tasks. Thus far, this belief has remained relatively unexplored in the domain of teaching and learning of mathematics, and has not been examined with respect to students' major field of study. In this study, we examined the performance of 95 senior undergraduate mathematics and education majors in symbolic and verbal tasks about the contraposition equivalence rule. The selection of two different groups of participants allowed for the examination of the hypothesis that students' major may influence the relation between their performance in tasks about contraposition and the context (symbolic/verbal) wherein this is placed. The selection of contraposition equivalence rule also addressed a gap in the body of research on undergraduate students' understanding of proof by contraposition. The analysis was based on written responses of all participants to specially developed tasks and on semi-structured interviews with 11 subjects. The findings showed different variations in the performance of each of the two groups in the two contexts. While education majors performed significantly better in the verbal than in the symbolic tasks, mathematics majors' performance showed only modest variations. The results call for both major- and context-specific considerations of students' understanding of logical principles, and reveal the complexity of the system of factors that influence students' logical thinking.","Contraposition equivalence rule; Logic; Proof; Reasoning; Reasoning domains; Undergraduate education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543025771

We base our theoretical development on fundamental cognitive activities, namely, perception of the world, action upon it and reflection on both perception and action. We see an emphasis on one or more of these activities leading not only to different kinds of mathematics, but also to a spectrum of success and failure depending on the nature of the focus in the individual activity. For instance, geometry builds from the fundamental perception of figures and their shape, supported by action and reflection to move from practical measurement to theoretical deduction and euclidean proof. Arithmetic, on the other hand, initially focuses on the action of counting and later changes focus to the use of symbols for both the process of counting and the concept of number. The evidence that we draw together from a number of studies on children's arithmetic shows a divergence in performance. The less successful seem to focus more on perceptions of their physical activities than on the flexible use of symbol as process and concept appropriate for a conceptual development in arithmetic and algebra. Advanced mathematical thinking introduces a new feature in which concept definitions are formulated and formal concepts are constructed by deduction. We show how students cope with the transition to advanced mathematical thinking in different ways leading once more to a diverging spectrum of success. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444404993

These alternatives were frequently seen as the 'best way' of finding a solution. This paper considers the relationship between the various strategies used by mixed ability children aged 7 to 12. An analysis of alternatives suggests that the selection is not underpinned by regression through the learning sequence, but by regression dominated by the child's preference for certain strategies over others. Through the evaluation of a hierarchy of preferences, divergence between the strategies available to the less able and the more able child is revealed. The alternative strategies used are based either on counting - procedural strategies, or on the use of selected known knowledge - deductive strategies. Above average children have both available as alternatives; evidence of deduction is rare amongst below average children. The more able child appears to build up a growing body of known facts from which new known facts are deduced. Less able children - relying mainly on procedural strategies - do not appear to have this feedback loop available to them. The paper contends that, for some children, procedural methods do not encourage the need to remember; the procedure provides security. On the other hand, deductive methods initially enhance the ability to remember other basic facts and eventually help children make extensive use of facts that are known to remove the need to remember new ones. More able children appear to be doing a qualitatively different sort of mathematics than the less able. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042419454

Piaget and Inhelder's, 1975, combinatoric operations). A significant number of children independently adopted more efficient solution procedures as they progressed on the tasks, with many displaying an algorithmic procedure reflecting the ""odometer strategy"" (holding one item constant while systematically varying each of the other items). Given that children as young as 7 years demonstrated this systematic strategy, it would appear that, within the appropriate learning environment, young children can discover a procedure for forming n x n combinations prior to the stage of formal operations postulated by Piaget and Inhelder.

I suggest that from a consideration of the schools of thought in philosophy of mathematics, two distinct movements emerge. These are the Euclidean programme, an attempt to base mathematics on firm foundations, and the quasi-empirical programme, the recognition that mathematics progresses heuristically, and through the re-transmission of falsity. As a consequence, two teaching perspectives can be identified, knowledge-centred and problem-solving respectively.

A sample of 1316 grade 11 students representing Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim ethnic groups from the three categories of public schools, which provide instructions in the vernacular languages of Sinhala or Tamil, participated in the study. Girls showed significantly higher performance in science compared to boys, and there was a significant gender difference in the levels of motivational dimensions in favor of girls. Although Tamil medium students possessed a higher level of motivation to learn science, Sinhala medium students outperformed their Tamil medium counterparts in science performance. Significant differences in science performance between Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim students were also observed. However, motivation towards learning science between Tamils and Muslims was not significantly different. Highly significant differences in both motivation to learn science and performance in science were found between three categories of schools. The present study provides information to education officials who have to achieve equity across gender, ethnicity, medium of instruction, and school category, teachers who deliver the subject and school principals who design academic support programs. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Motivation; Performance in science; Secondary school students; Students’ demography",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027336963

But what mathematical reasoning consists of is not always clear; it is generally assumed that everyone has a sense of what it is. Wanting to clarify the elements of MR, this research project aimed to qualify it from a theoretical perspective, with an elaboration that would not only indicate its ways of being thought about and espoused but also serve as a tool for reflection and thereby contribute to the further evolution of the cultures of the teaching and research communities in mathematics education. To achieve such an elaboration, a literature search based on anasynthesis (Legendre, 2005) was undertaken. From the analysis of the mathematics education research literature on MR and taking a commognitive perspective (Sfard, 2008), the synthesis that was carried out led to conceptualizing a model of mathematical reasoning. This model, which is herein described, is constituted of two main aspects: a structural aspect and a process aspect, both of which are needed to capture the central characteristics of MR. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anasynthesis; Commognition; Mathematical reasoning; Process aspect of mathematical reasoning; School mathematics; Structural aspect of mathematical reasoning; Theoretical model",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019103144

In this paper, we examine the teachers’ discussions that are an integral part of the Lesson Study research cycle. In particular, we investigate the ‘dialogic mechanisms’ that enable teachers’ pedagogical intentions to be developed within the context of discussions that stem from observations of students as they address mathematical problems. In so doing we hypothesize about the nature of the ‘dialogic space’ that is created and how this allows teachers to move from the collaborative analysis of student outcomes to an enhanced understanding of pedagogical intentions in mathematics. Data for this paper derive from a large research project taking place in Camden, London. This project aims to implement Lesson Study in the context of the introduction of a New National Curriculum for Mathematics in England. It involves a large cohort of mathematics teachers across primary and secondary schools. Quantitative analysis of video-recorded Lesson Study discussions is reviewed and one illustrative case study is included to contextualise the quantitative data. Findings suggest that a focus on student outcomes enables teachers to collaborate effectively on developing pedagogical intentions to directly address student need. Further, it seems that particular features of dialogue are evident where teachers move to an agreed perspective on pedagogic change; and evidence of ‘supportive moves’ in interactions suggest that a form of dialogic space is necessary if all teachers in a Lesson Study group are to learn from shared understandings about future teaching and learning needs. © 2016, The Author(s).","Dialogic space; Dialogue; Lesson Study; Mathematics vocabulary; Teacher learning",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976384243

Some of these studies, based on the analysis of reaction times, have recorded latencies for counter-intuitive or incongruent stimuli compared to intuitive or congruent ones. The proposed interpretations were that prior knowledge survives learning and still coexists with new closer-to-scientific knowledge, producing conflicts that delay correct answers. But these conclusions are based on the assumption that stimuli from different conditions only differ in the presence/absence of interfering misconceptions, which is sometimes, in our opinion, a rather fragile claim. Thus, we have designed a task in which it is possible to test different levels of interference and not only its effects in contrast to another condition. Then, we have used it to see if different intensities of interference produce different levels of conflict. The task tested the persistence of the misconception that “heavy objects sink more than lighter ones”. One hundred twenty-eight 14- to 15-year-olds were asked to tell which of the 2 balls presented (3 different materials and 3 different sizes) would “sink more” than the other. Analysis verified the presence of latencies and negative priming. For the most part, results show that the intensity of interference does produce corresponding latencies, which suggests greater conflict and therefore supports the hypothesis of persistence and coexistence of conceptions, even after correct answers are produced, and beyond other plausible effects due to the used stimuli. Prescriptions for theory and teaching are proposed. © 2014, The Author(s).","buoyancy (sink/float); conceptual change; misconception; negative priming; persistence; reaction time; science education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894704912

Working as individuals or pairs in tutorial clinical interviews, students solved non-symbolic interaction problems that utilized remote-sensing technology. Next, they used symbolic artifacts interpolated into the problem space as semiotic means to objectify in mathematical register a variety of both additive and multiplicative solution strategies. Finally, they reflected on tensions between these competing visualizations of the space. Micro-ethnographic analyses of episodes from three paradigmatic case studies suggest that students reconciled semiotic conflicts by generating heuristic logico-mathematical inferences that integrated competing meanings into cohesive conceptual networks.

The intervention group students also showed significant increase in their test scores between pre- and post-test. While at least 80 % of the students in the intervention group abandoned their initial ideas on all of the 17 alternative conceptions that were identified by the authors but one, the percent of student abandoning their initial ideas in the control group was less than 50. The discussion focuses on the implications of these results for addressing students' alternative conceptions, promoting the argumentation-pedagogy in college science courses and the challenges associated with the use of argumentation in college science classrooms. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.","alternative misconceptions; argumentation; college science; gases",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871102315

With the growing availability of mobile handheld technology (HHT), a number of location-based games for handheld mobile phones with GPS have been designed for educational use. The exploitation of this potential for engaging students into meaningful learning, however, so far remains unexplored. In an explorative design research, we investigated whether a location-based game with HHT provides opportunities for engaging in mathematical activities through the design of a geometry game called MobileMath. Its usability and opportunities for learning were tested in a pilot on three different secondary schools with 60 12-14-year-old students. Data were gathered by means of participatory observation, online storage of game data, an online survey and interviews with students and teachers. The results suggest that students were highly motivated, and enjoyed playing the game. Students indicated they learned to use the GPS, to read a map and to construct quadrilaterals.

In the first task, children were instructed to solve all items as accurately and as fast as possible with their preferred strategy. The second task was to generate at least two different strategies for each item. Results demonstrated that children of all grades and all achievement levels hardly applied the compensation and indirect addition strategy in the first task.

After a review of related theories, a property-oriented view of function is described which is based on visual aspects of functional growth. The theory is supported with data on student learning. The property-oriented view of function incorporates and extends previously described frameworks used in analyzing functional understandings, including the covariance and correspondence views (Confrey & Smith, 1991; Thompson, 1994). The property-oriented view differs from the covariance view in that less emphasis is placed on the manner in which the variables are changing and more emphasis is placed on the properties that result from these changes. The property-oriented view differs from a correspondence view in that functional properties such as invertibility and domain give rise to a different kind of thinking about functions than do properties such as symmetry, linearity, continuity, etc. Implications for further research and curriculum development are also provided. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010078170

The discussion will consider two different, but not antithetical, points of view. On the one hand, the problem of definitions will be considered in the general context of geometrical reasoning; on the other hand, the problem of definition will be considered an educational problem and consequently, analysed in the context of school activities. An introductory discussion focuses on definitions from the point of view of both Mathematics and education. The core of the paper concerns the analysis of some examples taken from a teaching experiment at the 6th grade level. The interaction between figural and conceptual aspects of geometrical reasoning emerges from the dynamic of collective discussions: the contributions of different voices in the discussion allows conflicts to appear and draw toward a harmony between figural and conceptual components. A basic role is played by the intervention of the teacher in guiding the discussion and mediating the defining process. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008016862

Thirty-six in-service mathematics teachers and 67 preservice mathematics teachers participated in the study. All participants were presented with a task calling for the generation of a counterexample, namely, a binary operation that is commutative but not associative. Responses to the task were analyzed according to four categories: correctness, productiveness, mathematical content, and underlying difficulties. The findings point to similarities and differences between the two groups. Both groups exhibited a weak concept by failing to produce a correct example and by using a limited content search-space. These findings suggest two main inhibiting factors: one related to the overgeneralization of the properties of basic binary operations and the other related to pseudo-similarities attributed to these properties, which seem to be created by the recurring theme of order.

The computer approach is formulated within a wider framework of versatile thinking in which global, holistic processing complements local, sequential processing. This is done through a combination of programming in BASIC, physical activities which simulate computer storage and manipulation of variables, and specific software which evaluates expressions in standard mathematical notation. The software is designed to enable the user to explore examples and non-examples of a concept, in this case equivalent and non-equivalent expressions. We call such a piece of software a generic organizer because if offers examples and non-examples which may be seen not just in specific terms, but as typical, or generic, examples of the algebraic processes, assisting the pupil in the difficult task of abstracting the more general concept which they represent. Empirical evidence from several related studies shows that such an approach significantly improves the understanding of higher order concepts in algebra, and that any initial loss in manipulative facility through lack of practice is more than made up at a later stage. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000095627

By comparing the analysis of three focal mathematics lessons through the lens of each framework as presented in the preceding papers, this paper also examines the similarities, differences, and potential complementarities of these frameworks to describe and evaluate mathematics instruction. To do so, a common structure for comparing all frameworks is suggested and applied to the analyses of the three selected lessons.

For this, we apply the general pedagogical knowledge test previously developed in the Teacher Education and Development Study—Mathematics (TEDS-M) comprising knowledge of structuring lessons (‘structure’); motivating students and managing the classroom (‘motivation/classroom management’); dealing with heterogeneous learning groups (‘adaptivity’); and assessing students (‘assessment’). Using test data of 188 novice teachers, advanced beginners, and expert teachers, we raise questions regarding the two tests’ (1) structural relations, (2) expert-novice differences, and (3) predictive validity. Findings: (1a) classroom management expertise can be empirically separated from general pedagogical knowledge, although the two constructs are positively inter-correlated (medium effect size), (1b) classroom management expertise is more highly correlated with pedagogical knowledge of classroom management than with pedagogical knowledge of ‘adaptivity’, ‘structure’, and ‘assessment’, (1c) classroom management expertise is more highly correlated with procedural pedagogical knowledge (cognitive demand ‘generate’) than with declarative pedagogical knowledge (cognitive demands ‘recall’ and ‘understand/analyze’), (2) novice teachers as well as advanced beginners are outperformed by expert teachers, and (3) classroom management expertise, compared with general pedagogical knowledge, is a stronger predictor for instructional quality aspects of classroom management as rated by students. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Assessment; Classroom management; General pedagogical knowledge; Instructional quality; Teacher expertise; Test; Video clips",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962858076

This paper reports on the definition of effective mathematics teacher education in TEDS-M, distinguishing between mathematics content knowledge and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge as essential cognitive components of mathematics teachers’ professional competencies. These competence facets were implemented as proficiency tests based on extensive coordination and validation processes by experts from all participating countries. International acceptance of the tests was accomplished whereas, by necessity, national specifications had to be left out, as is common in comparative large-scale assessments. In this paper, the nature of the TEDS-M tests for the primary study is analysed and commented on detail. The aims are to increase our understanding of mathematics content knowledge and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge, which are still fuzzy domains, to provide a substantive background for interpretations of the test results and to examine whether some educational traditions may be more accurately reflected in the test items than others.

Action research understands the change of practice as being already a central aim of the research process itself, and it also seeks to contribute to the professional development of all participants in the particular field of study. Even though (or maybe even because) action research has a long history in the literature, there is a wide variety of interpretations of it. These range all the way from research supportive, via interactive, to emancipatory approaches. There is also a broad range of objectives covering both improving professional environments and generating results of general interest. This paper explores the spectrum of justifications given for action research with a specific focus on science education. Two completely different examples of action research selected from Israel and Germany help illustrate the diversity of the topic. The Israeli case focuses primarily on the professional development of a group of teachers; the German example hones in on the development of suitable curricula and lesson plans for wide dissemination. Comparison of these two projects is embedded in a theoretical framework which categorizes the different action research modes and contemplates teachers' professional development. The aim of this paper is to reflect upon the common potential inherent in differing forms of action research on science education, including the aspect of professional development among teachers. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan.","action research; network of teachers; pedagogical content knowledge; professional development of teachers; reflective teachers",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861789947

In reader-oriented theory, the reader is viewed as actively constructing meaning from a text through the reading process; this endeavor is shaped and constrained by the intentions of the author, the beliefs of the reader, and the qualities the text requires the reader to possess. This paper also discusses how reading mathematics textbooks is further constrained by the authority and closed structure of these textbooks.

It has been argued that students with learning disabilities can succeed in science if they receive the kind of instruction they need. To facilitate such instruction, the special education teacher is often incorporated into the class along with the learning disabled students. We observed 53 high school science lessons from ten pairs of science and special-education teachers who were responsible for delivering instruction to groups of students, some of whom were learning-disabled. We analyzed narrative notes collected in these lessons reflecting the kinds of classroom activities, organization of work, and teachers' roles. In addition, we interviewed the teachers individually to gain a better understanding of these inclusive classes. The underlying question of this research was whether inclusive classes with two teachers delivered the type of science education that is better than solo-teaching in addressing the needs of learning-disabled students. Our evidence indicates that even with a special-education teacher present in the class, learning-disabled students usually did not receive a science education that met their needs.

The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N∈=∈31) and a second group (N∈=∈28) who were taught in a more traditional manner. Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument, the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable, helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2007.","Acids and bases; Chemistry teaching; Concept maps; Laboratory activities",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849088228

Pre-service science teacher trainees' prior knowledge about the dissolution of salts and sugar in water were elicited by the use of a simple diagnostic tool. The test revealed widespread alternative conceptions. These evaluation data were used to produce two segments of 'conceptual change text': concise summaries that present alternative and scientific conceptualizations for the concepts under study. The texts were administered to 21 pre-service elementary trainee teachers whose understandings of number of conceptions were subsequently re-evaluated employing a pre-test post-test approach in which their answers and reasons for their answers were solicited. The findings suggest that these pre-service elementary trainees' alternative conceptions are changed to become more in accord with the scientific view, with more participants providing correct answers along with correct reasons than before the intervention.

Each day, Jackie teaches two very different sections of accelerated eighth-grade mathematics using each of these curricular materials. Drawing from students' survey responses, classroom observations, and teacher interview data, we show ways in which Jackie's pedagogy differs considerably between the two courses and we shed light on reasons underlying this variation. By examining one teacher who enacts different practices in each of the two curricular contexts, this paper highlights factors that contribute to teachers' enacted curricula - factors that have been understated in previous mathematics education research on teacher development.

It is virtually impossible to take any kind of accurate snapshot of the state of its development. Undergraduate mathematics courses presented on the internet are relative newcomers to the race but nevertheless seem to be increasing in numbers also at a phenomenal rate. Internet education in mathematics is developing as a new mode of teaching with its own characteristics and possibilities, different from any traditional way of teaching. Research on this new mode of teaching is sparse and open research questions are temptingly plentiful. In a study presented in two parts, we try to capture the world of internet teaching of undergraduate mathematics with its myriad of possibilities. In this, the first part, we briefly list some of the technologies involved and we attempt to create some order in the huge number of activities that are available on the web. We give an overview of the scope of mathematics courses presented via the internet and attempt a graphical classification of the different types of web courses. In the second part (Engelbrecht, J. and Harding, A.: 2004a, Teaching undergraduate mathematics on the web 2: Attributes and possibilities) we discuss characteristics and implications of this mode of teaching/learning mathematics, list possible research issues and envisage possible future trends. © Springer 2005.","Mathematics teaching; Undergraduate mathematics; Web-based mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17144394817

Twenty-eight pre-service teachers participated in two workshops in which they had to pose problems on the basis of given problems. Analysis of the posed problems revealed a wide range of problems including those containing a change of one of the numerical data to another specific one, to a proof problem. Different kinds of posed problems enlightened some phenomena such as a bigger frequency of posed problems with another numerical value and a lack of posed problems including formal generalization. We also discuss the educational strengths of problem posing in solid geometry using the ""what if not?"" strategy, which could make the learner rethink the geometrical concepts he uses while creating new problems, make connections between the given and the new concepts and as a result deepen his understanding of them. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

All assumptions are supported by the traditional independent variables of the TPB model that affect the hoarding intention of food. However, the results of this study are completely different from previous studies when using the risk perception variable in the planned behavior theory model. In previous studies, the risk perception variable always negatively affected attitude and perceived behavior and buying intention. In this study, in contrast, the higher the risk perception the consumers get, the stronger the attitude the consumers purchase reserve goods. This demonstrates that a high-risk perception, in the case of COVID-19 pandemic or other civil unrests, will cause the intention to buy goods that no longer follows the common sense.

A lesson plan based on the socio-scientific issue of doping in professional sports and in fitness studios was designed and cyclically refined by a group of teachers and science education researchers. Along this case, together with previous studies of SSI-oriented curriculum development, the action research group started reflecting on the question of operational criteria for reflecting and carrying out socio-scientific issues in science classroom situations.

We define a taxonomy of external visual representations used in probability problem solving that includes pictures, spatial reorganization of the given information, outcome listings, contingency tables, Venn diagrams, trees, and novel graphical representations. We also propose a process model for probability problem solving (PPS) and use it as a framework to better understand how and why external visual representations are used. In a study of 34 novice probability problem solvers, participants worked to solve six probability word problems covering six probability subtopics. Both written and verbal structured interview protocols were analyzed to investigate when and how external visual representations are spontaneously used by problem solvers. Analyses of the coded transcripts showed that participants' probability problem-solving efforts move through the stages of PPS in a sequential but not always linear manner, sometimes exhibiting iterated attempts to represent the problem mathematically and to find a solution strategy. Results showed that use of specific external visual representations was associated with specific probability topics, and that certain choices of representation are associated with higher rates of solution success. These findings suggest that an external visual representation can facilitate probability problem solving, but only when an appropriate representation is chosen. Finally, we present evidence to show that external visual representations are usually created and first used during the stages of representing the problem mathematically and finding a solution strategy. However, pictures are often created during the initial stage of problem text understanding, and tables are sometimes created during computation of the solution. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951557509

Twenty upper secondary and five tertiary students were interviewed. In addition, 31 university students participated in a group discussion and answered a questionnaire regarding the animation. A model, based on variation theory, was then tested as a tool for distinguishing between what is expected to be learned, what is present in the visualizations, and what is actually learned by the students. Three critical features of the ability to visualize biomolecular processes were identified from the students' interpretations of the animation: the complexity of biomolecular processes, the dynamic and random nature of biomolecular interactions, and extrapolation between 2D and 3D.

Similarly, the PD facilitators discussed effective PD as having classroom application and experiences for teachers as learners. In addition, PD facilitators shared the need to develop collegial relationships with teachers and improve teacher knowledge. These views correspond to some of the standards and recommendations described in policy and research documents on effective PD. Criteria of effective PD in these documents that the participants did not mention included: (1) challenging teachers' content and pedagogical content knowledge with transformative learning experiences, (2) encouraging teacher leadership for sustained support, and (3) focusing on student learning by instructing teachers on how to use student data to inform their teaching practice.

Drawing on recent work by Watson and Mason stimulated by the ideas of Zygfryd Dyrszlag, the paper proposes that mathematical themes, powers, heuristics and activities generate a mathematical discourse which is not always represented in the questions students are asked, and that the real purpose of questions is to provoke students into construal, into constructing their own stories which constitute meaning and understanding, and which equip them for the future. The use of questions of whatever type depends on both scaffolding and fading their use with and in front of students, so that students internalize the questions into their own learning and doing of mathematics. The framework directed—prompted—spontaneous is proposed as an alternative to scaffolding—fading for informing interactions with students. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344993630

We begin by operationalizing the keyword routine. Two categorizations of routines are then offered. First, we distinguish between practical and discursive routines, discuss the process of their historical co-development, and claim that over time, new discourses germinated in routines straddling different types of practical and discursive activities. Second, the distinction between process-oriented and product-oriented routines is introduced. The former type of routine is called ritual and the latter deed or exploration, depending on whether the routine is practical or discursive. The claim is made that in the process of learning mathematics, the germinal routines, from which a discourse new to the learner is to emerge, are initially implemented as rituals. In the longer run, these routines are expected to undergo gradual de-ritualization until they become fully fledged explorations. The question of how to identify the gradual advances in this latter process is then addressed, and this is followed by a brief discussion of the ways in which teachers may support or hinder transforming rituals into explorations. We conclude by taking a critical look at relative advantages of conceptualizing learning as the process of routinization. © 2018, The Author(s).","Discourse; Exploration; Ritual; Routine; Task",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047906016

Drawing on the influence framework (Engle, Langer-Osuna, & McKinney de Royston, 2014), I examined interactions when students appropriated their peers’ ideas during collaborative mathematical problem solving and noted that each moment tended to follow particular interactions around authority. Notably, social and intellectual forms of authority became linked in ways that were directly related to how students’ ideas and behaviors were evaluated by the teacher. I close by discussing how the study of authority and influence offers fertile analytic ground to generate new understandings about collaborative student work in mathematics classrooms. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964206616

Little research exists, however, on what the struggles look like for middle school students and how they can be productive. This exploratory case study, which used episodes as units of analysis, examined 186 episodes of struggles in middle school students as they engaged in tasks focused on proportional reasoning. The study developed a classification structure for student struggles and teacher responses with descriptions of the kinds of student struggle and kinds of teacher responses that occurred. The study also identified and characterized ways in which teaching supported the struggles productively. Interaction resolutions were viewed through the lens of (a) how the cognitive demand of the task was maintained, (b) how student struggle was addressed and (c) how student thinking was supported. A Productive Struggle Framework was developed to capture the episodes of struggle episodes from initiation, to interaction and to resolution. Data included transcripts from 39 class session videotapes, teacher and student interviews and field notes. Participants were 327 6th- and 7th-grade students and their six teachers from three middle schools located in mid-size Texas cities. This study suggests the productive role student struggle can play in supporting ‘‘doing mathematics’’ and its implications on student learning with understanding. Teachers and instructional designers can use this framework as a tool to integrate student struggle into tasks and instructional practices rather than avoid or prevent struggle. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Instructional practice; Middle school mathematics; Persistence; Productive struggle; Student learning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943351699

We had two experimental groups: In one experimental group, students were required to provide two solutions for modelling problems related to the topic of Pythagoras’ theorem; in the other group, they were asked to find one solution for each problem. Students’ performance in solving tasks with and without a connection to the real world was assessed before and after a five-lesson teaching unit. In addition, the number of solutions developed and students’ experience of competence were assessed with a questionnaire during the teaching unit. The findings showed that, similar to previous studies, prompting students to find multiple solutions does not improve their performance directly.

How to integrate such goal statements with the instructional core, in ways that promote curricular and instructional coherence and continuity of student learning, is a perennial challenge. In the United States, the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, or CCSS-M, have been widely adopted, and are claimed to be based on research on learning in general and on learning trajectories in particular. The relationships, however, are tacit and incompletely, and sometimes controversially, articulated. This paper describes a body of work that associates the first nine grades of Standards (K-8) to eighteen learning trajectories and, for each learning trajectory, unpacks, interprets, and fills in the relationships to standards with the goal of bringing the relevant research to teachers (TurnOnCCMath.net). The connections are made using a set of descriptor elements, comprised of conceptual principles, coherent structural links, student strategies, mathematical distinctions or models, and bridging standards. A more detailed description of the learning trajectory for equipartitioning (EQP) shows the detailed research base on student learning that underpins a particular learning trajectory. How curriculum materials for EQP are designed from the learning trajectory completes the analysis, illustrating the rich connections possible among standards, descriptors, an elaborated learning trajectory, and related curricular materials. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Descriptors; Equipartitioning; Learning trajectories; Mathematics curriculum; Mathematics standards",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907504250

Although there are notable examples of classroom-based intervention studies in mathematics education research since at least the 1930s, the number of such studies is small and acutely disproportionate to the number of studies that have documented problems of classroom practice for which solutions are sorely needed. In this paper we first make a case for the importance of research on classroom-based interventions and identify three important features of this research, which we then use to review the papers in this special issue. We also consider the issue of 'scaling up' promising classroom-based interventions in mathematics education, and we discuss a major obstacle that most such interventions find on the way to scaling up. This obstacle relates to their long duration, which means that possible adoption of these interventions would require practitioners to do major reorganizations of the mathematics curricula they follow in order to accommodate the time demands of the interventions. We argue that it is important, and conjecture that it is possible, to design interventions of short duration in mathematics education to alleviate major problems of classroom practice. Such interventions would be more amenable to scaling up, for they would allow more control over confounding variables and would make more practicable their incorporation into existing curriculum structures. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.","Classroom-based interventions; Design experiment methodology; Educational innovations; Mathematics education; Scaling up; Theory and practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887343939

These pivotal teaching moments (PTMs), however, are key to instruction that builds on student thinking about mathematics. Video of beginning secondary school mathematics teachers' instruction was analyzed to identify and characterize PTMs in mathematics lessons and to examine the relationships among the PTMs, the teachers' decisions in response to them, and the likely impacts on student learning. These data were used to develop a preliminary framework for helping teachers learn to identify and respond to PTMs that occur during their instruction. The results of this exploratory study highlight the importance of teacher education preparing teachers to (a) understand the mathematical terrain their students are traversing, (b) notice high-leverage student mathematical thinking, and (c) productively act on that thinking.

In a series of task-based interviews, students evaluated the propriety of statements describing the convergence of sequences through a specially designed hands-on activity, called the □-strip activity.

Two subskills were hypothesized to represent, at least in part, what is required to learn from practice: (1) the ability to collect evidence about students' learning in order to analyze the effects of instruction, and (2) the ability to use the analysis to revise the instruction. Because it seems likely that different teaching situations and contexts reveal these learning-from-practice skills in different ways and to different degrees, this study examined the skills that pre-service teachers exhibited under two experimental conditions. Thirty pre-service teachers were asked to analyze the effects of a videotaped mathematics lesson on student learning, to support their analysis with evidence, and to use their analysis to revise the lesson. Based on the results, it appears that many entry level pre-service teachers can carry out a cause-effect type of analysis of the relationships between specific instructional strategies and students' learning, and can use this analysis to make productive revisions to the instruction. However, prospective teachers' ability to collect evidence that supports their analysis appears to be less developed. In addition, the type of analysis that prospective teachers carried out about the effects of instruction on students' learning differed dramatically across the two experimental task conditions. © Springer 2006.","Knowledge for mathematics teacher education; Knowledge for mathematics teaching; Learning from practice; Learning to teach",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947644181

However, this is not a study which shows how certain methods lead to better results. While it was found that learning improved, the methods and strategies the teachers used were not always generalisable across the project, indeed some were contradictory. Continued searching led to the identification of common underlying principles of teaching which different teachers manifested in different ways. Overt methods were less important than the collection of beliefs and commitments which underpinned teachers' choices. There was, however, a convergence of practice around a focus on long-term development, the process of becoming a learner of mathematics, rather than short-term gains.

The four-tiered teaching experiment explored in this paper involves participants at different levels of development who work interdependently towards the common goal of finding meaning in, and learning from, their respective experiences. The research examined here is concerned with the design and implementation of experiences that maximise learning at each level.

Perhaps as a result, they have been the object of a tremendous amount research over the past 50 years. This opening article gives an overview of the research literature on word problem solving, by pointing to a number of major topics, questions, and debates that have dominated the field. After a short introduction, we begin with research that has conceived word problems primarily as problems of comprehension, and we describe the various ways in which this complex comprehension process has been conceived theoretically as well as the empirical evidence supporting different theoretical models. Next we review research that has focused on strategies for actually solving the word problem. Strengths and weaknesses of informal and formal solution strategies—at various levels of learners’ mathematical development (i.e., arithmetic, algebra)—are discussed. Fourth, we address research that thinks of word problems as exercises in complex problem solving, requiring the use of cognitive strategies (heuristics) as well as metacognitive (or self-regulatory) strategies. The fifth section concerns the role of graphical representations in word problem solving. The complex and sometimes surprising results of research on representations—both self-made and externally provided ones—are summarized and discussed. As in many other domains of mathematics learning, word problem solving performance has been shown to be significantly associated with a number of general cognitive resources such as working memory capacity and inhibitory skills. Research focusing on the role of these general cognitive resources is reviewed afterwards. The seventh section discusses research that analyzes the complex relationship between (traditional) word problems and (genuine) mathematical modeling tasks. Generally, this research points to the gap between the artificial word problems learners encounter in their mathematics lessons, on the one hand, and the authentic mathematical modeling situations with which they are confronted in real life, on the other hand. Finally, we review research on the impact of three important elements of the teaching/learning environment on the development of learners’ word problem solving competence: textbooks, software, and teachers. It is shown how each of these three environmental elements may support or hinder the development of learners’ word problem solving competence. With this general overview of international research on the various perspectives on this complex and fascinating kind of mathematical problem, we set the scene for the empirical contributions on word problems that appear in this special issue. © 2020, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078280813

However, it can be difficult to create technology-mediated, collaborative and contextual activities within a conventional classroom setting. This paper explores how a combination of a transformative, mobile technology-mediated approach, RME, and a particular model of 21st century learning facilitates the development of mathematics learning activities with the potential to increase student engagement and confidence. An explanatory case study with multiple embedded units and a pre-experimental design was conducted with a total of 54 students in 3 schools over 25 hours of class time. Results from student interviews, along with pre-test/post-test analysis of questionnaires, suggest that the approach has the potential to increase student engagement with, and confidence in, mathematics.

Analysis of the data indicates that the teachers were constructing distinct identities for teaching mathematics as they worked in the institutional context of the school and the context of ongoing professional development.

The notion of creative thinking level has been discussed .by experts. The perspective of mathematics creative thinking refers to a combination of logical and divergent thinking which is based on intuition but has a conscious aim. The divergent thinking is focused on flexibility, fluency, and novelty in mathematical problem solving and problem posing. As students have various backgrounds and different abilities, they possess different potential in thinking patterns, imagination, fantasy and performance; therefore, students have different levels of creative thinking. A research study was conducted in order to develop a framework for students' levels of creative thinking in mathematics. This research used a qualitative approach to describe the characteristics of the levels of creative thinking. Task-based interviews were conducted to collect data with ten 8th grade junior secondary school students. The results distinguished five levels of creative thinking, namely level 0 to level 4 with different characteristics in each level.

This is reflected in an increase in environmental education research focussing on children's awareness and attitudes toward the environment. In this study, we focused on this issue from a school effectiveness perspective and evaluated (a) which student characteristics predict environmental attitudes and awareness, (b) whether schools make a difference in their students' environmental attitudes and awareness and (c) if school effects are different for students with varying levels of science ability. The cross-sectional Flemish data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment 2006 (4,999 students in 156 schools) were re-analysed using a multivariate multilevel model to address these issues. Results show that gender, immigrant status, socioeconomic status and educational track are important in explaining students' environmental attitudes and awareness. Furthermore, the results show that schools do matter; schools in which science is taught in a more hands-on manner are associated with higher student environmental awareness whilst environmental learning activities are associated with more pro-environmental attitudes amongst students. After controlling for student characteristics, these school effects do not differ between more science-literate children and their less or average science-literate peers. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2010.","Constructivist teaching; Environmental attitudes; Environmental awareness; PISA; School effectiveness; Scientific literacy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952323593

Research suggests that academic success can be achieved by focusing on both the individual and social aspects of learning. Within the area of mathematics education, the development of metacognitive skills and the incorporation of discourse in classroom instruction has resulted in students having deeper conceptual understandings of the content and increased mathematical achievement. However, studies in this field tend to focus on the effects of these practices separately, making research that seeks to harness the potential of both quite rare. This paper reports on a study that was aimed at addressing this gap in the literature by examining the effects of writing and argumentation on achievement. Two hundred and eleven students and five teachers participated in this multimethod study that investigated the effects of three treatment conditions on mathematical achievement. These conditions were writing alone, argumentation alone, and writing and argumentation combined. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between the groups, and tests of the contrasts showed that students who engaged in both argumentation and writing had greater knowledge gains than students who engaged in argumentation alone or neither activity. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2008.","Learning environments; Mathematical argumentation; Mathematics achievement; Writing",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349669399

In this article, we propose equity analytics as a quantitative approach to analyzing aspects of equity and inequity in classrooms. We introduce a classroom observation tool that focuses on relatively low-inference dimensions of classroom discourse, which are cross-tabulated with demographic markers (e.g., gender, race) to identify patterns of more and less equitable participation within and across lessons. We argue that equity analytics can support researchers and practitioners in identifying subtle patterns of inequity in classroom discourse. As we show, even in classrooms with highly experienced, equity- minded teachers, subtle inequities can emerge that are detectable through this quantitative methodology. To conclude, we discuss how equity analytics can complement qualitative approaches in the study of equity and inequity in classrooms. © 2018 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

In this study our main objective is (1) to identify the problematic areas in the psycho-pedagogical and methodological components of teacher education in a multicultural setting and (2) to test the effectiveness of simulation technologies in preparing teachers to deal with risks. Our main research methods were pedagogical modeling and the project-based approach which enabled us to create a model of working students in problem-focused groups with the use of simulation technologies and to create an assessment complex which helps evaluate the preparedness of future teachers to work under risks in a multicultural environment. Moreover, we have developed an assessment complex tool which enables to assess if teachers are prepared to work in the context of increased migration. This tool helps establish the ethnic identity types of future teachers as well as evaluate their coping strategies. We have evaluated the increasing potential of simulation technologies and how they can be used for effective multicultural teacher education; we have established the criteria for teacher competences and preparedness to deal with risks; we have identified the conditions of the effective use of simulation technologies in the informational space of a university. In order to develop the noxological competence of future teachers we have developed an educational model which aims to develop the preparedness of teachers to deal with risks with the use of simulation technologies.

We illustrate our arguments with data taken from research contexts in Catalonia-Spain and South Africa. In these two parts of the world, the language policy in education has long been an issue, with a monolingual orientation that values one language (i.e., Catalan in Catalonia and English in South Africa) over others. Throughout the introduction of specific examples of policy documents, classroom practices, and participants’ reports, our main point is that the right of using the students’ languages makes sense because it is itself more than an intrinsic human right; it is an option that potentially benefits the creation of mathematics learning opportunities. Especially for the instances of classroom practices, our examples can be considered as representative in that they point to a common situation in our data: despite the fact of the language of learning and teaching being fixed, there is room for the learners and the teacher to take or react to a decision on what language to use, with whom, and how in concrete moments of the interaction. However, on the basis of our studies and drawing on the literature in mathematics education and language diversity, we argue that language rights are not sufficiently connected to language as a pedagogical resource. The enactment of these rights is still contributing in many ways to the social and political construction of problems concerning the role of certain languages in classroom interaction. We conclude the paper by discussing some possibilities for framing language as a resource that provide effective support to all students’ learning of mathematics. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919915115

Students' visual behaviors were tracked and recorded when they read a report demonstrating the relationship between the greenhouse effect and global climate change in 2 diagrams and 4 textual sections. Based on the pretest scores, 13 participants were categorized into high and low prior knowledge (PK) groups. Eye-tracking measures including the total reading time, total fixation duration, and total regression number on each area of interest of the 2 groups were compared. A heat map was further used to show the overall visual distribution of each group. In addition, the inter-scanning transitions between the textual and graphical information of the 2 groups were compared and further confirmed by the patterns of the scan paths. The results revealed that overall students spent more time reading the textual than the graphical information. The high PK students showed longer fixation durations and more regressions on the graphics than the low PK students. Meanwhile, the high PK students showed more inter-scanning transitions than the low PK students not only between the text and graphics but also between the 2 data diagrams. This suggests that the high PK students were more able to integrate text and graphic information and inspect scientific data which is essential for online inquiry learning. This study provides eye-tracking evidence to show that low PK students have difficulties integrating scientific diagrams with expository texts and inspecting scientific data diagrams that are commonly shown in websites.

In this study, a multi-dimensional instrument, the SLSE instrument, was developed and validated to assess students' SLSE based on the previous literature. Besides, the interrelations between students' approaches to learning science and SLSE were explored. A total of 311 Taiwanese eighth graders were invited to respond to the SLSE instrument and the Approaches to Learning Science (ALS) questionnaire. After ensuring several types of validity (e.g. construct validity and criterion-related validity) and the reliability of the SLSE questionnaire, the results suggested that the SLSE instrument should have satisfactory validity and reliability to measure Taiwanese eighth graders' SLSE in terms of 5 dimensions: Conceptual Understanding, Higher-Order Cognitive Skills, Practical Work, Everyday Application, and Science Communication. Moreover, through Pearson correlation analyses, the results revealed that the Taiwanese eighth graders who perceived themselves as having a deep motive, along with the orientation of surface motive, tended to report higher SLSE. Also, those students who reported adopting deep strategies to learn science were more likely to possess higher SLSE. The regression results indicated that, overall, the students' deep strategies and deep motive were strong predictors of their SLSE, particularly for the Higher-Order Thinking Skills SLSE. Yet, the Practical Work SLSE could only be predicted by the Deep Strategy dimension of ALS. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.","approaches to learning science; high school students; science learning self-efficacy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884756883

The instructional treatment took place over 7 weeks during the Junior Year of 15 students from our target population. Immediately after instruction, a written instrument was administered followed, several weeks later, by in-depth interviews. The results are that many of our participants achieved a level of knowledge and understanding of functions on a par with beginning college students, including preservice teachers, as reported in the literature. Many conceptual difficulties that have been reported in the research literature were not as prevalent for our participants and some of them were capable of solving difficult problems involving composition of functions.

Research on student learning has identified the vital roles of two particular operations-splitting and units coordination-play in students' development of advanced fractions knowledge. Whereas Steffe and colleagues (e.g., Steffe, 2001; Steffe & Olive, 2010) describe these knowledge structures in terms of fractions schemes, Piaget introduced the possibility of modeling students' psychological structures with formal mathematical structures, such as algebraic groups. This paper demonstrates the utility of modeling students' development with a structure that is isomorphic to the positive rational numbers under multiplication-the splitting group. We use a quantitative analysis of written assessments from 58 eighth grade students to test hypotheses related to this development. Results affirm and refine an existing hypothetical learning trajectory for students' constructions of advanced fractions schemes by demonstrating that splitting is a necessary precursor to students' constructions of 3 levels of units coordination.","Constructivism; Fractions; Learning theory; Middle grades; Piaget",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870344066

The analysis tracks the learning of informal inferential reasoning before, during, and after the introduction of sampling variability concepts.

However, despite the vast investments in technology resources for schools and universities, the realities of schooling and the complexities of technology-equipped environments resulted in a much slower integration process than was predicted in the 1980s. Hence researchers, together with teachers and mathematicians, began examining and reflecting on various aspects of technology-assisted teaching and learning and on the causes of slow technology integration. Studies highlighted that as technology becomes increasingly available in schools, teachers' beliefs and conceptions about technology use in teaching are key factors for understanding the slowness of technology integration. In this paper, I outline the shift of research focus from learning and technology environment-related issues to teachers' beliefs and conceptions. In addition, I highlight that over the past two decades a considerable imbalance has developed in favour of school-level research against university-level research. However, several changes in universities, such as students declining mathematical preparedness and demands from other sciences and employers, necessitate closer attention to university-level research. Thus, I outline some results of my study that aimed to reflect on the paucity of research and examined the current extend of technology use, particularly Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) at universities, mathematicians' views about the role of CAS in tertiary mathematics teaching, and the factors influencing technology integration. I argue that due to mathematicians' extensive use of CAS in their research and teaching, documenting their teaching practices and carrying out research at this level would not only be beneficial at the university level but also contribute to our understanding of technology integration at all levels. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Mathematicians; Review; Technology; University level",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867506909

We present a general model for skills instruction, characterized by explicit and spiral instruction, integration into content learning, practice in several scientific topics, and application of performance tasks. The model was applied through an instructional program that focuses on the following learning skills: information retrieval, scientific reading and writing, listening and observing, data representation, and knowledge presentation. Throughout the 7th-8th grades, 160 students learned the whole program or one of its components: structured instruction (SI) of SC skills, or performance tasks (PT). A comparison group of 42 students did not receive instruction of SC skills. Students' performances were assessed through a questionnaire and a complex task that measured students' scientific content knowledge, SC skills, and the quality of the final products. Results indicated that students who learned the whole program or one of its components achieved higher scores in all categories than the comparison group students. High achievers can benefit from just one component of the program: either structured instruction (SI) or learning from practice (PT). However, they can hardly acquire SC skills spontaneously. Low and average achievers require both components of the SC program to improve their performances. Results show that without planned intervention, the spontaneous attainment of SC skills occurs only to a limited extent. Systematic teaching of skills can make a significant difference. The explicit instruction of skills integrated into scientific topics, the opportunities to implement the skills in different contexts, the role of performance tasks as 'assessment for learning'-all these features are important and necessary for improving students' scientific literacy. Our general model of skills instruction can be applied to the instruction of other high-order skills. Its application can lead to the realization of the central goal of science education: literate students possessing scientific knowledge. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2009.","Learning skills; LSS- learning skills for science; Performance-based assessment; Scientific communication; Scientific literacy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349678828

The results reveal a wide gap between sampled pre-service middle school teachers' general perceptions/confidence and their limited mathematics knowledge needed for teaching fraction division conceptually.

Attitudes toward ICT were positive and gender differences were weak. Although we found school had an effect on the behavioural dimension of attitudes, it was not caused by the accessibility of computers per se. However, large numbers of students per computer (up to N = 68) greatly reduced student's use of computers at schools. Lack of internet connection at home caused greater supplementation of internet-related activities in schools relative to home. Gender and age-related differences in ICT participation were greatly influenced when comparing the home and school environment.

Specifically, we used classroom discourse to identify what the participating teachers promoted (zone of promoted action) or allowed (zone of free movement) in the classroom as a way to understand better their potential for development. We found that teachers who promoted actions or events that they ultimately did not allow students to experience seemed to be at a point in their development analogous to Vygotsky's pseudo-conceptual stage, prior to full concept formation. Moreover, we found that, at this illusionary zone, the teacher's capacity to listen actively to students' thinking seemed to affect the teacher's transition toward more inquiry-based forms of practice. We concluded that understanding the zone of promoted action and the zone of free movement the teacher organizes in the classroom can indicate the existence or absence of an illusionary zone and thereby provide insight into a teacher's potential for development. © Springer 2005.","Sociocultural theory; Teacher development; Teacher practice; Zone of free movement; Zone of promoted action; Zone of proximal development",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17344366178

In this paper, we support the thesis that these difficulties are closely related with the complexity of this notion. In order to study this complexity, we refer to Tarski's semantic truth theory, which contributes to clarifying the different aspects of implication: propositional connective, logically valid conditional, generalized conditional, inference rules. We will show that for this purpose, it is necessary to extend the classical definition of implication as a relation between propositions to a relation between open sentences with at least one free variable. This permits to become aware of the fact that, in some cases, the truth-value of a given mathematical statement is not constrained by the situation, contrary to the common standpoint that, in mathematics, a statement is either true or false. In the present paper, the didactic relevance of this theoretical stance will be illustrated by an analysis of two problematic situations and the presentation of some experimental results from our research on first-year university students' understanding of implication.","Contingent statement; Designation; Implication; Inference rules; Logical validity; Open sentence; Quantification; Satisfaction; Semantic; Truth-value",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543039125

Some of the pupils' responses in interviews and in a questionnaire were consistent with the 'outcome approach' and with the use of certain heuristics: 'representativeness'; 'availability'; 'equiprobability.' A significant proportion of pupils revealed superstitions. Standard 'random devices' such as dice were regarded by some children as subject to personal, religious or causative influences. In a comparison between two culturally-contrasted subgroups in the same school, we found significant differences in scores on probability tests, even when taking account of numerical and non-verbal ability.

Recent theories of human cognitive evolution suggest that human cognition has evolved through four distinct stages: episodic, mimetic, mythic, and theoretical. This progression was driven by three cognitive advances: the ability to 'represent' events, the development of symbolic reference, and the creation of external symbolic representations. In this paper, we suggest that we are developing a new cognitive culture: a 'virtual' culture dependent on the externalization of symbolic processing. We suggest here that the ability to externalize the manipulation of formal systems changes the very nature of cognitive activity. These changes will have important consequences for mathematics education in coming decades. In particular, we argue that mathematics education in a virtual culture should strive to give students generative fluency to learn varieties of representational systems, provide opportunities to create and modify representational forms, develop skill in making and exploring virtual environments, and emphasize mathematics as a fundamental way of making sense of the world, reserving most exact computation and formal proof for those who will need those specialized skills. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54649084513

The paper presents an original methodology that can be used for building immersive virtual reality (VR) applications dedicated to training medical skills. The methodology is named ""knowledge-oriented medical virtual reality"" (KOMVR), as it uses basic knowledge-engineering tools during processes of planning, building and verification of interactive educational solutions. The paper shows successive stages of the methodology and the tools used for its execution. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated with a simple example - a human body atlas. Major time reduction can be achieved while using the methodology - time reduction in the presented case was from 50 to 14 working days.

However, in-depth research on these relations can only be carried out if a sound theoretical model for subject-specific teacher cognition (knowledge and competence/practical skills) and—in the case of a quantitative research approach—corresponding measures are available. The subject-specific cognition can be modeled as basic professional knowledge (BK) complemented by two further components of reflective competence (RC) and action-related competence (AC) with a close connection to professional demands. In order to implement these subject-specific demands rigorously, we developed innovative standardized measures for primary mathematics teachers.

Directed at the rather difficult to comprehend human blood circulation unit in the biology materials for junior high school students, a Mobile Meaningful Blood Circulation Learning System, called MMBCLS gamification learning, was developed. In the study, the instructional design is based on meaningful learning and follows the principles of digital game-based learning models to design after-class multimedia materials, which allow learners to enjoy learning. With a quasi-experimental design, Kolb's learning styles scale and meaningful learning scale were utilized as research instruments. Taking a G8 class as the subject, 46 valid questionnaires were returned. The research findings show divergences in mobile game-based learning styles: students with convergent styles highly regarded the well-designed curriculum in meaningful learning; student gender presented no significant difference in curriculum design and learning achievement in meaningful learning; students with different learning styles revealed remarkable differences in learning achievement; and students in the experimental group apparently had a higher learning achievement than the students in the control group, with notable differences. The research outcomes could be cited by teachers for designing material and provide educators with a reference for the mobile as meaningful media material design. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","3D mobile game education; Gamification; Learning achievement; Learning styles; Meaningful learning",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948775397

Different models of implementing ESD in the teaching of science and technology are presented and illustrated by various case studies, which were developed by the University of Bremen chemistry education group. These examples and the corresponding evaluation case studies show that thoroughly combining the ESD framework with science teaching that follows a socio-scientific issues-based approach to education has great potential for helping students develop many general educational skills. It also opens a path to a more balanced view of science in its societal and professional context. This allows career orientation both in and beyond science and engineering. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","Education for sustainable development; Educational reform; Science education; Socio-scientific issues-based science education; Sustainability; Teacher education",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923039846

In this issue of ZDM, we have compiled a collection of scholarship on language in mathematics education research, representing a range of approaches to the topic. In this survey paper, we outline a categorisation of ways of conceiving of language and its relevance to mathematics education, the theoretical resources drawn upon to systematise these conceptions, and the methodological approaches employed by researchers. We identify four broad areas of concern in mathematics education that are addressed by language-oriented research: analysis of the development of students’ mathematical knowledge; understanding the shaping of mathematical activity; understanding processes of teaching and learning in relation to other social interactions; and multilingual contexts. A further area of concern that has not yet received substantial attention within mathematics education research is the development of the linguistic competencies and knowledge required for participation in mathematical practices. We also discuss methodological issues raised by the dominance of English within the international research community and suggest some implications for researchers, editors and publishers. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Interaction; Language; Linguistic competence; Multilingual contexts",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919913237

The final version called the Thermodynamic Concept Survey (TCS) has both Thai and English versions and is divided into two parts-Part I consists of temperature and heat transfer, and ideal gas law and Part II consists of the first law of thermodynamics and processes. The content validity was analyzed by both Thai and Australian physicists. The reliability of the survey was determined by using more than 2,000 student responses from Australia and Thailand. The statistical analyses showed that the survey is reliable and valid. We also report on the implementation of the survey to investigate alternative conceptions in thermodynamics.

Our analyses focus on performance, strategy use, and mistake patterns. Results suggest that personalization supported situational reasoning (Nathan, Kintsch, & Young, 1992) about the actions and relationships in the scenario, improving performance for weaker students and on harder problems. However, personalized scenarios seemed to act as a distraction when stronger students in the sample worked on easier problems.

However, there is concern that the availability of online materials may reduce lecture attendance. Given that we did not observe a significant drop in lecture attendance following the introduction of WBLTs in the School of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Sydney, we surveyed 563 undergraduate students to discover why they attended lectures despite the availability of copious online materials. 82 % of responding students reported that they always or mostly attend lectures and 74% expressed a negative emotion when asked how they would feel if lectures were abolished.Free-form comments indicated that students attend lectures for reasons either positive about lectures or negative about WBLTs. Students feel that lectures provide a better learning environment. They also appreciate the discipline imposed by scheduled lectures where they can concentrate in a scholarly community of learners. Lectures intrinsically contribute to the 'university experience' and the social aspect is also important. Some students are motivated to attend through habit, guilt or by financial concerns. The perceived difficulty of a lecture was often cited as a reason to attend, and WBLTs were appreciated to revisit difficult concepts. Negative comments highlighted perceptions that WBLTs do not fully capture lecture content, can be inefficient and unreliable, and predispose students to procrastination. The majority of students use WBLTs in addition to attending lectures and they perceive distinct roles for each mode. Most students who did not attend lectures claimed they were unable to for logistical reasons, including sickness or timetable clash. Some cited inconvenience or distraction in overcrowded theatres as reasons not to attend. Students also make strategic decisions to prioritise competing commitments, such as work or assessments. Only a minority of students prefer WBLTs to lecture attendance. These students prefer the ability to work at their own pace, at a time of their choosing and without peer-distraction. This study supports the contention that WBLTs alone do not reduce lecture attendance, and highlights features of lectures which can be improved to increase attendance and student engagement.","Asynchronous learning; Blended learning; Lectopia; Lecture attendance; On-campus education; Web-based lecture technologies",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84255200436

The study investigated how the teachers drew on the materials, what they understood about the curriculum resources, and how they connected their use of the materials to their observations of student thinking. There were similarities across the teachers, particularly with respect to their goals and how they read and followed recommendations in the teacher resource materials. There were differences in how their task revisions were in response to what they observed about student thinking. The teacher who most intensively observed student thinking made connections between her interpretations of students' strategies and her use of the curriculum resources, allowing her to design learned adaptations. Learned adaptations required both an understanding of the design rationale and empirically developed knowledge of how that rationale played out in practice. The empirically developed knowledge could not be totally anticipated by the designers, in part because it developed within a particular context by a teacher with particular characteristics. The case of the teacher who developed learned adaptations showed how these complementary forms of knowledge helped her to use the curriculum resources in ways that enhanced students' opportunities for sense making. Furthermore, her adaptations were intended to facilitate success not only at the task level, but also across instructional sequences as well.

It begins by identifying in recent literature two categories of criticism of ethnomathematics: epistemological, related with the way ethnomathematics positions itself in terms of mathematical knowledge; and pedagogical, related to the way ethnomathematical ideas are implicated in formal education. After a description of both of these categories, the pedagogical implications of ethnomathematics are considered by means of confronting the criticisms of recent research in the field. Ethnomathematics research conceives its pedagogical implications in different ways, some of them contradictory. Such contradictions are related with the societal role of school, with the idea that we can ""transfer"" knowledge from one setting to another and the tendency to reduce ethnomathematics to a ready-to-apply ""tool"" for the school-learning of mathematics. The author discusses the first two criticisms in the light of recent research concerned with the social and political dimensions of mathematics education. Concerning the latter, a typical case of an ethnomathematical research study looking at bringing local knowledge into school in the name of promoting diversity is analyzed. It is the author's contention that ethnomathematical research runs the risk of conveying an idea of culture where the Other is squeezed from its otherness. The article concludes by arguing that a deeper theoretical discussion is needed in the majority of the research currently done in ethnomathematics so that well-intentioned actions do not end up having a result opposite to their aims. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Criticism; Ethnomathematics; Multiculturalism; Philosophy; School mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951957798

It is argued that variation problems as an ""indigenous"" Chinese practice aim to discern and to compare the invariant feature of the relationship among concepts and solutions. This practice also aims to provide opportunities for making connections, since comparison is considered the pre-condition to perceive the structures, dependencies, and relationships that may lead to mathematical abstraction. In the first part of the article, the ""indigenous"" practice is discussed against its philosophical Daoism and Confucianism backgrounds.

Using structural equation modeling to analyze data on 151 elementary mathematics teachers' concerns and efficacy beliefs 5 years into a mandated curriculum reform on problem solving, the study provides empirical support to a model integrating teachers' concerns and efficacy beliefs. This model suggests that teachers' concerns of preceding stages inform their concerns of succeeding stages; that teachers' efficacy beliefs about using the reform affect their task and impact concerns and are, in turn, informed by their self concerns; and that efficacy beliefs about employing pre-reform instructional approaches influence all types of teacher concerns. A qualitative analysis of data from 53 teacher logs provided additional insights into teachers' concerns about the reform.

The aim of the study was to examine teachers' conceptions of representation as a process in doing mathematics, and their perspectives on the role of representations in the teaching and learning of mathematics at the middle-school level. Interviews with middle school mathematics teachers suggest that teachers use representations in varied ways in their own mathematical work and have developed working definitions of the term primarily as a product in problem solving. However, teachers' conception of representation as a process and a mathematical practice appears to be less developed, and, as a result, representations may have a peripheral role in their instruction as well. Further, the data suggested that representation is viewed as a topic of study rather than as a general process, and as a goal for the learning of only a minority of the students-the high-performing ones.

Qualitative analysis of the responses revealed six expert themes surrounding the potential challenges that learners face, and the required cognitive abilities for transfer and translation processes. Consultation with relevant curriculum documents identified four types of biological knowledge that students are required to develop at the secondary level. The expert themes and the knowledge types exposed were used to determine how pupils might acquire and apply these four types of biological knowledge during learning.

The aims were to understand better students' confidences and explore which factors affected performance and how these were inter-related. Questionnaires were administered which posed questions regarding previous mathematics qualifications, student confidences, attitude, liking of the subject and motivation. The responses were analysed and compared with marks achieved by the students in their first year engineering mathematics examinations. The majority of students were fairly confident, reported improved confidence acquired during their first year of university study and had positive attitudes. Better mathematically qualified students were generally more confident and successful in mathematics. A regression model was produced which predicted a 12% increase in mathematics marks per increase in GCSE mathematics grade, and 5% increase in marks for each increase in confidence level. Thus, better qualifications (and the skills represented) were shown to be associated with better university marks and student confidence also produced a notable association with the marks achieved. The findings suggest that having attended to the mathematics syllabi, lecturers could seek to boost student confidence in their ability in mathematics as a further means to improve student performance at university. © The Author 2009.

We ground our discussion in ideas of trigonometry and modular functions and draw from a professional development research project to illustrate our approach. In this project, many teachers experienced dissonance that was rooted in their commitments to their curricular knowledge of trigonometry. Teachers who built new meanings into a coherent whole were those who coordinated them at a micro level. Teachers who saw implications of their own reasoning for student learning were also successful at expressing that reasoning in natural language. We saw a similar pattern in the case of teachers' creation of meanings for action and process conceptions of mod(f(x),g(x)). Teachers who gained insight into implications of their own activities for student learning were the teachers who reasoned at a micro level in regard to the meaning of mod, who coordinated that meaning with a covariational perspective on the behavior of functions, and who expressed that coordination in natural language. We conclude that a primary feature of tasks that promote teachers' construction of coherent mathematical meanings is that they support an overall effort to have teachers engage in the coordination of meanings in the context of explaining significant ideas and relationships. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Coherence; Covariation; Meaning; Professional development; Reflection; Tasks; Teachers; Trigonometry",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349095729

This study reports on six case studies exploring Year 3 students' procedures for and understanding of mental addition and subtraction, and understanding of number sense and other cognitive, metacognitive, and affective factors associated with mental computation. The case studies indicate that the mental computation process is composed of four stages in which cognitive, metacognitive and affective factors operate differently for flexible and inflexible computers.

It turns out that many authors have contributed to the debate why we should apply history. Their arguments can be divided into conceptual, (multi-) cultural and motivational ones. The number of authors who concentrated on the methodological question ""How could we introduce history into mathematics lessons?"" is considerably smaller. Those who want to make history an integral part of mathematics education have to bridge the gap between theoretical arguments and practical ideas, and, connected with this, between historians and teachers, and ultimately between mathematicians from the past and present day students. We divided the various surveyed publications, mainly journal articles, into categories according to a framework in order to clarify the discussion on the role of the history of geometry in education.

Flipping has garnered a large amount of hype fromthe popular education media and has been adopted in a variety of contexts. Despite this high amount of interest, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of classroom flipping on student academic outcomes. Specifically, no rigorous studies of the effects of flipping amathematics course on students'mathematical understandings and achievement appear in the literature. This article reports results from a control group study of flipping a large (N = 690), first-year university calculus course for life sciences students. Students in the flipped course sections on average outperformed their counterparts in the traditional sections on the final exam, though only by approximately 8%. A more detailed analysis reveals the true beneficiaries in a flipped classroomçthose with high basic mathematical ability and low initial calculus knowledge. Gains for this group are considerable: approximately 10% on the final, with an effect size of d = 0.56, and comparable gains on an independent measure of calculus conceptmastery.This study positions classroomflipping as an effective practice in undergraduate mathematics and calls for further research into the mechanisms behind its effectiveness. © The Author 2015.

In contrast, students who provided incorrect solutions consistently constructed an image of the problem's context that was misaligned with the intent of the problem. We also observed that students who caught errors in their solutions did so by refining their image of how the quantities in a problem's context are related.

We conclude that children think and learn through their bodies.

We narrow our findings and discussion to a particular type of lexical bundle (called a ""stance bundle"" or bundles that relate to feelings, attitudes, value judgments, or assessments) because it was the most significant type found. Through comparing our corpus from secondary mathematics classrooms with two other corpora (one from university classrooms (not including mathematics classrooms) and one from conversations), we show that most of the stance bundles were particular to secondary mathematics classrooms. The stance bundles are interpreted through the lens of interpersonal positioning, drawing on ideas from systemic functional linguistics. We conclude by suggesting additional research that might be done, discussing limitations of this work, and pointing out that the findings warrant further attention to interpersonal positioning in mathematics classrooms. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Corpus linguistics; Hegemonic practices; Hidden curriculum; Lexical bundle; Mathematics education; Socio-cultural; Stance bundle",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955846106

To do so, grade kindergarten-12 teachers have been using differentiated instruction, a process of proactively modifying instruction based on students' needs. It is supported by literature on learning and has resulted in the improvement of grade K-12 students' learning.Yet, there is no research literature that reportsworkon differentiated instruction at the undergraduate level for meeting the diverse needs of college students, particularly in mathematics courses. Students frequently report their collegemathematics classes to be unstimulating, boring, irrelevant, poorly taught or transmissive.This study examined the use of differentiated instruction in an undergraduate mathematics course for addressing such concerns and thereby improving students'mathematical learning.Aconcurrentmixed methods research study was used to address the central research question:What impact does differentiated instruction in a college mathematics class have on students' mathematical understandings? A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control-group research design measured the relationship between the differentiated instruction in the course and the students'mathematical understandings. Simultaneously, the impact of the differentiated instruction on the students' mathematical understandings was explored using interviews and analyses of students' work. The participants included elementary education majors enrolled in a mathematics course covering the topic of number and operations. Results showed that students receiving differentiated instruction experienced greater gains in theirmathematical understandings. Suggestions for incorporating differentiated instruction in undergraduate mathematics courses are provided along with plans for further research. © The Author 2010.

Procedural learning involves only memorizing operations with no understanding of underlying meanings. Conceptual learning involves understanding and interpreting concepts and the relations between concepts.The relationship between these learning types has been discussed for a long time. For some researchers, procedural knowledge forms the basis for conceptual knowledge, while for others the relationship is reversed. The aims of the study reported here were first to explore the nature of students' learning in traditional differential equations (DEs) courses and second to clarify the relationship between procedural and conceptual learning.To address these aims an achievement test with13 open-ended questions, probing procedural and conceptual learning with regard toDEs, was administered to 77 candidate mathematics teachers, enrolled in a traditional DEs course. The analysis of students' responses to the test items showed that 85% of candidate teachers gave correct responses on procedural questions whilst only 30% of them gave correct responses to the conceptual questions. These findings suggest that the candidate teachers' learning was primarily procedural in the context of traditional instruction and content and that this did not lead themto develop the conceptual knowledge needed to interpret newsituations properly and to produce new ideas beyond the ones they had memorized. In addition, based upon the student levels in both procedural and conceptual learning, it was concluded that conceptual learning supports and generates procedural learning but procedural learning does not support conceptual learning. © The Author 2010.",,"Students; Teaching; Conceptual knowledge; Conceptual learning; Mathematics education; Mathematics teacher; Open-ended questions; Procedural knowledge; Procedural learning; Student learning; Student response; Traditional instruction; Differential equations","English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953934652

In the collection of the data, the researcher employed two types of instruments: the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and the Mathematics Teaching Anxiety Scale (MATAS). The LSI determined the participants' learning style preference: divergent, assimilator, convergent, and accommodator. The MATAS found the participants' mathematics teaching anxiety level. The researcher used the one-way ANOVA with α = 0.05 in the analysis of the data. The study revealed that there were statistically significant differences in mathematics teaching anxiety between convergent and the other three types of learners: divergent, accommodator, and assimilator. The difference was in favour of convergent learners. In other words, convergent learners had less mathematics teaching anxiety than the other types of learners.

They have been established in order to ease widespread and serious difficulties that a significant number of students have with mathematics, particularly at the school-university transition. They usually offer mathematics and/or statistics support to students across the full range of disciplines studied. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those students who make good use of such centres are not just those who struggle with mathematics. Many frequent users are quite competent and simply want to do better. The study reported here describes and analyses data from one cohort of engineering students. A novel aspect is the quantification of the proportion of support centre visitors who fall into these, and other, categories. We conclude of the cohort in the study, mathematics support has improved the pass rate by ∼3%. Of the failures, about half (∼4% of the sample total) could well have passed had they attended the mathematics support centre regularly. Furthermore, the majority of those attending were not students who were in danger of failing. This has important implications not only for the design of mathematics support provision, but also for the performance of the high fliers.

One of the main challenges is the design of good problem solving tasks that are original, nonroutine and new to the students.

My analysis of the students' incident reports found that the issues raised focused on four main areas: teaching and classroom management; student factors such as pre-requisite knowledge, understanding, resistance and motivation; issues concerning relationships with colleagues, students and parents; and school organizational issues such as policies and access to resources. Their learning about teaching for understanding focused on three broad areas: the conditions necessary to teach for understanding; facilitators of teaching for understanding; and barriers to teaching for understanding. The paper concludes with a discussion of the lessons learned about fostering reflection in novice teachers, and suggestions for further research. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Critical incident reflections; Self-study; Teaching for understanding",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750285180

This everyday knowledge is compared to what children were expected to learn about money in school. The data support the conclusion that certain kinds of differences between everyday and school mathematics can make the inclusion of everyday mathematical topics in classrooms problematic.

However, epistemological reform that is based on the constructivist referent of learning as conceptual change has a very limited viability in traditional mathematics classrooms because of its cultural insensitivity. By contrast, the social epistemology of critical constructivism addresses the socio-cultural contexts of knowledge construction and serves as a powerful referent for cultural reform. From this perspective, the social reality of traditional mathematics classrooms is governed by powerful cultural myths that restrain the discursive practices of teachers and students. The power of the repressive myths of cold reason and hard control is evident in the ways in which they act in concert to create a highly coherent and seemingly natural social reality. Epistemological reform, of traditional mathematics classroom learning environments is, therefore, synonomous with cultural reconstruction. Critical constructivism, which has a central concern with discourse ethics and the moral agency of the teacher, draws on the social philosophy of Jurgen Habermas and argues for an alternative culture of communicative action to be established in mathematics classrooms.

In this paper we examine and discuss these differences while maintaining the position that while some differences may be inherent, many differences can be narrowed so that mathematics learning and practice in school and out of school can build on each other and be connected. Before discussing a framework that we think sheds some light on connecting these experiences, we present some research from several of our studies that illustrates some of the differences between in-school and out-of-school mathematics practice and lays the groundwork for the discussion of the framework. We then discuss Saxe's (1991) research framework for 'gaining insight into the interplay between sociocultural and cognitive development processes through the analysis of practice participation' (p. 13). Although Saxe's framework is a method for studying the interplay between sociocultural and cognitive development processes, we propose that it may be helpful in working towards connecting in-school and out-of-school mathematics learning and practice. Thus, we discuss the framework with illustrations from our own research, and then elaborate on ways to make this interplay between in-school and out-of-school contexts more deliberate. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009028140

Therefore, it is essential to support numerical learning from basic to more advanced competency levels. From educational psychology it is known that learning is most effective when the respective content is neither too easy nor too demanding in relation to learners’ prerequisites. However, so far it is difficult to assess individual’s cognitive workload independently from performance to adapt learning environments accordingly. In the present study, we aim at identifying learners’ cognitive workload induced by addition tasks of varying difficulty using electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, a classifier using specific features in the EEG-signal is trained to differentiate between different levels of task difficulty significantly above chance level and with high consistency over all participants. Importantly, our model even allows for the prediction of cognitive demands induced by the addition tasks in a cross-participant approach. Closer inspection of the crucial EEG features indicates that oscillations in the theta and alpha band recorded from parietal electrodes are most reflective of current task difficulty. In summary, we are able to differentiate cognitive workload of participants independently from performance based on data of only a small number of electrodes. This suggests that a reduced EEG-setup combined with cross-participant classification may be a feasible approach to assess learners’ cognitive workload. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Arithmetic; Brain-computer interface; Cognitive workload; Electroencephalography (EEG); Numerical cognition",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970016351

Pupils have the most difficulty when trying to understand the sub-microscopic level because it is outside their range of experience. A virtual laboratory enables a simultaneous demonstration of all three levels of a chemical concept along with dynamic visualisation at the submicroscopic level. This study presents the effective usage of a virtual laboratory that can overcome the gap between the previously-mentioned conceptual levels. We carried out a didactic experiment to test the effectiveness of a virtual laboratory that enables dynamic visualisation. The experiment involved seventh-grade pupils (N = 109) from five different primary schools in Slovenia. We asked ourselves the question as to whether the learning outcomes of pupils are better when they use a virtual laboratory rather than in science classes without a virtual laboratory where dynamic visualisation at the sub-microscopic and sub-micro levels are only explained by means of static demonstrations. A virtual laboratory has many significant advantages. The results of the didactic experiment showed that, in terms of knowledge acquisition, using a virtual laboratory is better than science classes without visualisation elements. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","Chemistry; Dynamic visualisation; Knowledge; Primary school; Submicro animations; Virtual laboratory",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960871931

Despite the foundational role of geometry and spatial reasoning for later mathematics success, the strand receives inadequate instructional time and is limited to concepts of static geometry. Moreover, early years teachers typically lack both content knowledge and confidence in teaching geometry and spatial reasoning. We describe our attempt to deal with these issues through a research initiative known as the Math for Young Children project. The project integrates effective features of both design research and Japanese Lesson Study and is designed to support teachers in developing content knowledge and new approaches for teaching geometry and spatial reasoning. Central to our Professional Development model is the integration of four adaptations to the Japanese Lesson Study model: (1) teachers engaging in the mathematics, (2) teachers designing and conducting task-based clinical interviews, (3) teachers and researchers co-designing and carrying out exploratory lessons and activities, and (4) the creation of resources for other educators. We present our methods and the results of our adaptations through a case study of one Professional Learning Team. Our results suggest that the adaptations were effective in: (1) supporting teachers’ content knowledge of and comfort level with geometry and spatial reasoning, (2) increasing teachers’ perceptions of young children’s mathematical competencies, (3) increasing teachers’ awareness and commitment for the inclusion of high quality geometry and spatial reasoning as a critical component of early years mathematics, and (4) the creation of innovative resources for other educators.

Teachers’ discursive moves in responding to student input are keys to developing and supporting a rich vein of interactive discussion. While initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) sequences have been shown to dominate science classroom discourse patterns worldwide, teacher ‘prompts’ are important for opening up opportunities for reasoning and higher level learning. This paper describes the analysis of video sequences for five expert elementary teachers across three countries to develop a coding scheme for these teachers’ ‘discursive moves’ to guide and respond to student inputs, that unpacks more completely the strategies they use to develop interactive discussion. The analysis showed varied patterns of knowledge transaction, with teacher discursive moves serving three broad purposes: to elicit and acknowledge student responses, to clarify and to extend student ideas. The patterns of talk were also related to the dialogic-authoritative distinction in analysis of talk, to show that this distinction is only clear for particular types of expert practice. While the particular moves teachers use vary across parts of lessons we argue that they are revealing of teachers’ particular beliefs and of systemic constraints, and that there exist patterns in the use of the discursive categories that capture how expert teachers build deeper level knowledge in classroom interactive talk. We describe ways in which the analysis can inform science teacher education and the professional learning of teachers of science. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Dialogic-authoritative discourse; Elementary school science classroom practice; Expert teachers of science; Interactive classroom talk; Teacher discursive moves; Teacher response to student input; Video classroom analysis",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939955569

We report on a retrospective analysis of an initial design experiment aimed at supporting the learning of three math leaders who were charged with supporting the learning of middle-grades mathematics teachers across a large US school district. Initial goals for the math leaders’ learning included: (a) viewing teachers’ improvement of their classroom practices as a progression; (b) designing supports for teachers’ learning that were informed by assessments of teachers’ current practices, were oriented towards long-term goals for teachers’ practices, and would enable teachers to attain short-term goals that constituted reasonable next steps; and (c) facilitating professional development by pressing on teachers’ ideas differentially and building on their contributions. Findings suggest that the math leaders increasingly viewed teachers’ improvement of their classroom practices as a developmental progression and began to design connected sequences of activities. However, they struggled to facilitate the activities in ways that would meet their ambitious goals for teachers’ learning. Based on our findings, we indicate potential improvements to our design for supporting math leaders’ learning.

Data from teacher reflections on classroom video were analyzed to identify how teachers attended to, interpreted, and responded to what they noticed about children's participation. Findings suggest that a lens of participation supported teachers as they considered how to provide more equitable mathematics instruction. Further, the depth to which teachers noticed children's participation was connected to their positionality as equitable mathematics educators.","Equitable mathematics; Identity; Noticing; Participation; Positionality; Professional development",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901406183

In this paper, I bring the two areas of research together. Drawing on data from one professional learning community in the Data Informed Practice Improvement Project, I show how teachers in this community came to understand key concepts about learner errors and shifted their ways of talking about learner errors. I identify three important shifts that the teachers made in their learning about learner errors: from identifying to interpreting errors; from interpreting to engaging errors; and from focusing on learner errors to focusing on their own knowledge. I argue that these three shifts suggest a deepening of teachers' thinking in relation to learner errors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Learner errors; Professional learning communities; Teacher learning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892443554

In particular, students' explanations of energy in a biological context, how energy is involved in different biological situations and whether energy is present and what types of energy are involved in diagrams depicting biological phenomena were investigated. The pencil-and-paper diagnostic test, specifically designed for this study, was used to elicit students' understanding using test items involving biological phenomena. The results showed that many students had problems in understanding energy and energy-related concepts in the following areas: First, the majority of the students provided definitions of energy rather than the explanations they were asked to provide, and the definition could have been rote-learned. Second, although nearly all students knew the energy conservation principle (energy cannot be created or destroyed), many of them were unable to apply this concept to biological contexts. Third, many students erroneously claimed that the energy for metabolism and life processes is made available during photosynthesis in plants, during digestion in animals or that this energy comes directly from the sun. Fourth, about two thirds of the students erroneously indicated that there is no energy involved/present in inanimate objects such as a statue.

Data sources included interviews, videotapes of classroom activity, and a teaching philosophy questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted using an iterative coding technique. We found coherency between the teachers' perceived orientations and their emergent ideas about PBL, their sense of PBL as being compatible with their goals, and the specific challenges with which they struggled. All the teachers wanted their students to be successful; however, different definitions of success led to quite different approaches toward teaching, and for the most part, these differences appeared to have occurred because of existing orientations the teachers held for teaching their discipline.

Research indicates that some of these difficulties may stem from intuitive interference with formal/logical reasoning. Our research aims at deepening the understanding of these difficulties and their underlying reasoning mechanisms to help students overcome them. For this purpose we carried out behavioral, brain imaging and intervention studies focusing on a previously demonstrated obstacle in mathematics education. The literature reports that many students believe that shapes with a larger area must have a larger perimeter. We measured the accuracy of responses, reaction time, and neural correlates (by fMRI) while participants compared the perimeters of geometrical shapes in two conditions: (1) congruent, in which correct response was in line with intuitive reasoning (larger area-larger perimeter) and (2) incongruent, in which the correct answer was counterintuitive. In the incongruent condition, accuracy dropped and reaction time for correct responses was longer than in the congruent condition. The congruent condition activated bilateral parietal brain areas, known to be involved in the comparison of quantities, while correctly answering the incongruent condition activated bilateral prefrontal areas known for their executive control over other brain regions. The intervention, during which students' attention was drawn to the relevant variable, increased accuracy in the incongruent condition, while reaction times increased in both congruent and incongruent conditions. The findings of the three studies point to the importance of control mechanisms in overcoming intuitive interference in mathematics. Overall, it appears that adding a cognitive neuroscience perspective to mathematics education research can contribute to a better understanding of students' difficulties and reasoning processes. Such information is important for educational research and practice. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2010.","Brain imaging; Control mechanisms; Geometry; Intuitive interference; Intuitive reasoning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864292273

Such modelling involves investigations of meaningful phenomena, deciding what is worthy of attention (identifying complex attributes), and then progressing to organising, structuring, visualising, and representing data. Results reported here are derived from the first year of a three-year longitudinal study in which three classes of first-grade children and their teachers engaged in activities requiring the creation of data models. The theme of ""Looking after our Environment,"" a component of the children's science curriculum at the time, provided the context for the activities. Findings include children's abilities to focus their attention on qualities of items rather than the items themselves in identifying attributes, switch their attention from one item feature to another, and create a broad range of models in organising, structuring, and representing their data.

As a context for the study served the difficult-to-grasp concept of 'inverse' order relationship among unit fractions, that is, the larger the number of parts the smaller the size of each part (e.g., 1/7∈>∈1/10 although 10∈>∈7). I conducted this study as a whole-class teaching experiment in a third grade classroom at a public school in Israel. The qualitative analysis of tasks presented to students and students' responses to those tasks, as well as a quantitative measurement of percents of student responses to assessment questions, indicated that the distinction between a participatory and an anticipatory stage is sound and useful in guiding the teacher's selection of tasks to assess/teach students' mathematical thinking. In particular, this analysis demonstrates that in a classroom where the vast majority of students appear to understand a new concept, a substantial portion of the class - those who formed the new conception only at the participatory stage - may be at risk of being left behind. This study also highlights a new way of organizing assessment to minimize such unfortunate situations, including three levels of assessment rigor a teacher can use in regular classroom settings. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Activity-effect relationship; Anticipation; Assessment; Children's conceptions; Constructivist theory; Fractions; Problem situations; Tasks; Teaching activities; Teaching experiment",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548473346

The sample of the study consisted of secondary school pupils in Cyprus. A test was developed which involved seven items: one item requested pupils to provide a definition of what function is and the other six items were developed in order to investigate pupils' ability to transfer information from one representation to another and to solve problems on function. Findings revealed pupils' difficulties in giving a proper definition for the concept of function and resolving problems on functions involving conversions between diverse modes of representation. Several inconsistencies among pupils' constructed definitions, their competence to use different representations of functions and their problem solving ability, were also uncovered, indicating lack of flexibility between different ways of approaching functions. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2007.","Compartmentalization; Concept definition; Concept image; Conversion; Function; Problem solving; Representation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047110643

Sixteen students, ages 11 and 12, from a lower economic area, were asked to work in pairs (one member of each pair a more able student and one a less able student) to solve problems that tapped common misconceptions about decimal fractions. Half the pairs worked on problems presented in familiar contexts and half worked on problems presented without context. A comparison of pretest and posttest results revealed that students who worked on contextual problems made significantly more progress in their knowledge of decimals than did those who worked on noncontextual problems. Dialogues between pairs of students during problem solving were analyzed with respect to the arguments used. Results from this analysis suggested that greater reciprocity existed in the pairs working on the contextualized problems, partly because, for those problems, the less able students more commonly took advantage of their everyday knowledge of decimals. It is postulated that the students who solved contextualized problems were able to build scientific understanding of decimals by reflecting on their everyday knowledge as it pertained to the meaning of decimal numbers and the results of decimal calculations.","Collaborative learning; Decimals; Discourse analysis; Intermediate/ middle grades; Piaget; Problem solving; Situated cognition; Vygotsky",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035618025

So far the effects of two types of representations were investigated: the numerical-horizontal and the numerical-vertical representations. Our study was mainly aimed at determining which representations (numerical-horizontal, numerical-vertical, numerical-explicit or geometric) yielded higher percentages of one-one correspondence reactions. For these purposes, 189 middle class 10th to 12th graders were asked to react to 14 problems dealing with comparing infinite sets. The problems presented different representations of the same infinite sets. It was found that one-one correspondence justifications were mainly elicited by numerical-explicit and by geometric representations.

Research methods: The leading research method that tests hypothesis is pedagogical experiment (ascertaining, forming and control stages of experiment) and also the method of processing of quantitative results of the research. 270 future foreign language teachers took part in the experimental research where 138 respondents belonged to an experimental group and 132 future teachers belonged to a control group. Results of the research: the model of formation of academic mobility of future foreign language teachers was designed and scientifically grounded. Formation of academic mobility is implemented by means of media-education technologies, methodological principles which include systemic, competency-based, synergetic, student-oriented approach and the following principles such as humanization, viability, self-education, succession, continuity, dialogism. The proposed model was realized in three stages (motivational-cognitive, organizational- action-based, professionalcommunicative) and provided for gradual acquisition by future educators the motivation for academic migration and their ability to master their foreign language communicative competence. The purpose of the above mentioned model is to develop such personal qualities which will contribute to students' readiness to get education in foreign educational environment. The result of the realization of the model is the formation of the academic mobility of foreign language teachers on a creative level.

This study was intended to investigate the level of critical thinking disposition of prospective mathematics teachers. Using vase study methods, three studies were done in Malang. Three levels of critical thinkers were identified from these case studies namely: non-critical thinker, emergent critical thinker, developing critical thinker. Majority of prospective mathematics teachers' critical thinking dispositions are at the non-critical thinker level. Only a few of them are at the emergent critical thinker, and very rare at the developing critical thinker level. It can be concluded that prospective mathematics teachers are not critical thinker yet.

In recent years, a particular specification of NOS, often described as “the consensus view,” has become very influential and has gained ready acceptance in many countries around the world as a template for curriculum building and research into students' and teachers' NOS understandings. This article documents developments that led to the emergence of this particular interpretation of NOS and expresses concern about the overall thrust of the consensus-oriented movement. First, the authors point to the overly simplified, sometimes confused, frequently misleading, often unhelpful and philosophically naïve nature of some of the individual items that comprise the “consensus view.” For example, the naïve proposition that there is a crucial distinction between observation and inference is singularly unhelpful to students trying to make sense of contemporary technology-supported investigative work, and the too literal interpretation of the tentative character of science can be counterproductive, leading students to regard all science as no more than temporary. Second, the authors argue that the portrayal of science is too general and fails to capture the complexities and diverse practices of generating knowledge across the subdisciplines. Although the consensus approach has played a major role in consolidating the position of NOS in the school science curriculum and providing a base for NOS assessment practice its success has created a major problem: a disarmingly simple specification of NOS items, especially when reinforced by a purpose-built assessment regime (the Views on Nature of Science Questionnaire), can quickly become established as the norm for building a curriculum and designing teaching and learning materials. The great danger is that items in the approved list become oversimplified by busy teachers and taught as truths about NOS, with consequent narrowing of the curriculum. It is time to move on, time to replace or enrich the so-called consensus view of NOS with a philosophically more sophisticated approach and with a more authentic view of contemporary scientific practice—one that includes the perspectives of scientists active at the research frontier as well as the views of philosophers of science, sociologists of science, historians of science, and science educators. Rather than making generalized statements that science is subjective rather than objective, tentative rather than certain, individually or socially constructed rather than discovered, we need a more sophisticated approach that shows how these contrasting views have arisen and in what circumstances a particular description is applicable. A number of alternative approaches to curriculum building are described, including those based on Wittgenstein's notion of a family resemblance among the subdisciplines of science, followed by an outline of the authors' views of how to broaden and enrich students' NOS understanding through an approach called understanding scientific practice. In conducting their activities as a professional community, scientists have established a distinctive language and ways of thinking about, investigating, and explaining phenomena and events; developed a cluster of procedures for generating new knowledge and solving problems relating to its continued development; institutionalized a set of conventions and underlying values to guide the continuing practice of science; and developed a community-regulated and community-monitored rationality for scrutinizing and evaluating all new knowledge claims. The authors argue that these procedures should form the basis of NOS-oriented curricula. At the very least, the school science curriculum should pay close attention to the distinctive language of science (especially the linguistic conventions for reporting, scrutinizing, and validating knowledge claims), the characteristics of scientific inquiry (including its range of subdisciplinary variants), the role and status of the scientific knowledge it generates and the modeling that attends the construction of scientific theories, the social and intellectual circumstances of significant scientific achievements and developments, how scientists work as a social group, the values and conventions that underpin scientific practice (and how they can be threatened by vested interest and commercial pressures), and the ways in which science impacts and is impacted by the social context in which it is located. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the pedagogical implications of adopting such an approach. © 2017 Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014880961

This ethnographic and interview study investigated how ability and disability were constructed over 1 year in a middle school mathematics classroom. Children participated in two kinds of mathematical pedagogy that positioned children differently: procedural and discussion-based. These practices shifted over time, as the teacher increasingly focused on memorization of procedures to prepare for state testing. Two Latino/a children with learning disabilities, Ana and Luis, used multiple cultural practices as resources, mixing and remixing their engagement in and identifications with mathematics. Ana, though mastering the procedural performances necessary for success in the second half of the year, authored herself as separate from mathematics, creating distance between herself and those she considered “smarties.” Luis was identified as a creative mathematical problem-solver and was initially positioned as a “top” mathematics student. As the pedagogy shifted towards memorization, Luis resisted the pedagogy of procedures and continued to identify as a creative thinker in mathematics. Yet, his teachers saw him as increasingly disabled and eventually placed him in a group only for those in special education. This group, which Luis named the “unsmartest group,” was seen as least competent in mathematics by both teachers and students. The narratives of Luis and Ana highlight mathematics classrooms as relational and emotional and demonstrate different strategies of resistance to the construction of mathematical disability. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Disability studies; Equity; Identity; Learning disability; Special education; Urban schools",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939953298

Data analysis was based on the pretest-posttest scores and students' responses to relevant phenomena during the course. The results showed that students' reasoning ability significantly improved with a d-effect size of 2.58 for the technical aspects and 2.51 for the conceptual validity aspects, with the average normalized gain being 0.62 (upper-medium) for the two aspects. Students' conceptual understanding of mechanics significantly improved with a d-effect size of about 2.50 and an average normalized gain of 0.63. Students' competence in mechanics shifted significantly from an under competent level to mastery level.

To explore how such an integration process could be supported, we conducted an intervention in secondary vocational laboratory education. Our boundary-crossing approach was informed by the literature on boundary crossing and accompanying learning mechanisms (e.g., reflection in the form of perspective making and taking, and transformation in the form of hybridization). We hypothesized that reflection, as making and taking perspectives on school-taught and work-related knowledge, could lead to transformation, i.e., help students integrate these types of knowledge into a hybridized whole. Data collection included video and audio recordings of five 1-h meetings with three students, the data from their research projects, and interviews with the teacher and two workplace supervisors. The analysis of the students' reasoning during the meetings revealed that their level of integrating school-taught statistics and work-related knowledge increased significantly and with a medium effect size.

This broadening of the mathematics curriculum to encompass a focus on statistics makes considerable demands on teachers. Most mathematics teachers acknowledge the practical importance of statistics and are willing to give more relevance to the teaching of statistics; however, many mathematics teachers do not consider themselves well prepared to teach statistics. The aims of this study were to investigate the conceptual understanding of statistics of prospective secondary mathematics teachers; the nature of their attitudes towards statistics and if there was a relationship between attitude towards statistics and conceptual understanding of statistics. Conceptual understanding was measured using a standard assessment instrument (comprehensive assessment of outcomes in a first statistics course) which allows comparison across other disciplines. Despite being very mathematically able and confident, the prospective mathematics teachers in this study do no better in the assessment than students from other (mostly non-quantitative) disciplines. This, perhaps, gives further evidence that statistical thinking is different from mathematical thinking and that a strong background in mathematics does not necessarily translate to statistical thinking. Conceptual knowledge was poor in some fundamental areas of statistics such as being able to properly describe the distribution of a quantitative variable and data production. The attitudes of these teachers towards statistics were measured using a widely used instrument (survey of attitudes towards statistics). The results indicate generally positive attitudes but an acknowledgement that statistics is not a subject quickly learned by everyone and requires discipline to learn. No strong correlation was found between attitudes and conceptual knowledge. It is recommended that in order to improve teacher knowledge, teacher education programmes must include tailored modules in statistics and highlight the differences between mathematical and statistical thinking. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Affect; Attitudes; Conceptual understanding; Difficulty; Interest; Statistics; Teacher knowledge; Value",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887412075

We summarize some of these theoretical perspectives and attempt to show how online environments have changed them, as well as some theoretical problems that remain to be solved. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2012.","Communities and networks; Humans-with-media; Interaction; Mathematics teacher education; Mathematics teacher learning; Online professional development",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888031760

Previous work on transition between institutions suggests that transitional problems can be critical, and students often regard mathematics as 'difficult' during transitional periods. However, our analysis of students' interviews showed a more positive discourse, one of reported challenge, growth and achievement; transition was not seen as an obstacle but as an opportunity to develop a new identity. Particularly in relation to mathematics, this was reflected in a need for a better understanding of the subject, and for being more responsible for their learning. Thus, we propose to re-think transition as a question of identity in which persons see themselves developing due to the distinct social and academic demands that the new institution poses. Conceptualising transition in this way could have important practical implications for the way that institutions support students' transition. © 2011 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.","Identity; Post-compulsory education; Transition",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959494699

We articulated several reasons why we believe that the educational transition from school to university mathematics should be viewed (and is) a rite of passage, and then examined certain aspects of the process of transition. Present article is a continuation of our study, resulting in an enhanced version of the model. In order to properly address all aspects of transition (such as a number of cognitive and pedagogical issues) we enrich our model with the notions of cognitive conflict (conceptual change) and culture shock (although defined and used in contexts that differ from the transition context, nevertheless, we found these notions highly relevant). After providing further justification for the application of our model to transition in mathematics, we discuss its many implications in detail. By critically examining current practices, we enhance our understanding of the many issues involved in the transition. The core section 'Messages and implications of the model' is divided into subsections that were determined by the model (role of community, discontinuity of the transition process, shock of the new, role of time in transition, universality of transition, expectations and responsibilities, transition as a real event).

Language enables important phenomena to be named as thinkable concepts that can then be refined in meaning and connected together into coherent frameworks. Gray and Tall (1994) noted how this happened with the symbols of arithmetic, yielding a spectrum of performance between the more successful who used the symbols as thinkable concepts operating dually as process and concept (procept) and those who focused more on the step-by-step procedures and could perform simple arithmetic but failed to cope with more sophisticated problems.

While implementing it correctly, it succeeds to attract students from both groups - the high achievers group and the much bigger group of students to whom the traditional science programs were frequently inaccessible. Both groups found the Earth System approach attractive and interesting and both gained a significant amount of knowledge and understanding. However, the earth systems approach alone will not be enough and in order to attract most of the students and in addition such programs should be based on a holistic approach that should also include the following characteristics: (1) Learning in an authentic and relevant context as much as possible. (2) Organizing the learning in a sequence that shifts gradually from the concrete to the abstract. (3) Adjusting the learning for variant abilities learners. (4) Integrating the outdoor environment as an integral and central component of the learning process. (5) Focusing on both the cognitive and the emotional aspects of learning.

Under this dispensation, both researchers and educators have emphasized the role that teachers' attitudes toward information technology play as a crucial factor in the successful use of computers in the teaching and learning of mathematics. In this paper, we seek to study and examine the attitude of mathematics professors toward computers. In addition, the paper also investigates the effects of age and computer experience on computer attitude, usage, software familiarity, and perceived pedagogical usefulness. The broader perspective of the paper has drawn its input from more than fifty five percent (55%) of the mathematical sciences faculty of King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals who participated in a survey conducted as feedback for the paper. Measurement tools deployed in this regard were a slightly modified Computer Attitude Scale (CAS) by Loyd and Gressard (1984), and the Pedagogical Use (PU) unit of the Computer Attitude Scale for Teachers (CAST) by Yuen and Ma (2001). The acquired data was analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Although both ANOVA and Duncan multiple comparison revealed that Age and computer experience did not affect attitudes towards computers and their pedagogical usefulness, the raw data nonetheless does show some trend towards that. From the result, one can conclude that mathematics professors not only have positive attitude towards computers, but seems convinced of the positive role that computers can play in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The only aggravating factor is the technical know-how and concomitant experience that are essential in guiding pedagogical activities towards effective and proper utilization of these technologies.

Yet, how to help students develop the skills they need to engage in this type of higher-order thinking remains elusive. In order to contribute to the dialogue on this subject, we share results from a classroom-based interpretive study of teaching and learning proof in geometry. The goal of this research was to identify factors that may be related to the development of proof understanding. In this paper, we identify and interpret students' actions, teacher's actions, and social aspects that are evident in a classroom in which students discuss mathematical conjectures, justification processes and student-generated proofs. We conclude that pedagogical choices made by the teacher, as manifested in the teacher's actions, are key to the type of classroom environment that is established and, hence, to students' opportunities to hone their proof and reasoning skills. More specifically, the teacher's choice to pose open-ended tasks (tasks which are not limited to one specific solution or solution strategy), engage in dialogue that places responsibility for reasoning on the students, analyze student arguments, and coach students as they reason, creates an environment in which participating students make conjectures, provide justifications, and build chains of reasoning. In this environment, students who actively participate in the classroom discourse are supported as they engage in proof development activities. By examining connections between teacher and student actions within a social context, we offer a first step in linking teachers' practice to students' understanding of proof. © Springer 2005.","Classroom interaction; Geometry; Link between teaching and learning; Pedagogical choices; Proof and reasoning; Secondary school mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544494269

In order to do this, the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) was translated into Korean and administered to 439 students (99 science-independent stream students, 195 science-oriented stream students and 145 humanities stream students). Based on the results from this survey, interviews with some students and teachers were also carried out and three science classrooms were also observed. It was found that the teacher-student interactions in Korean senior high school science classrooms reflect the general image of the youth-elder relationship in society as well as the senior high school's unique nature - portraying a scene of 'directing teachers and obeying students'. It was also found that students experience unique interactions in their science classrooms with their particular teachers. It was considered that this difference comes from the overlapping of a teacher's personal characteristics with the nature of a stream (e.g., curriculum, expectation towards the students in that stream). This article reports part of a larger study conducted with Korean senior high school students and teachers. The aim of the main study was to investigate three different aspects of the high school science classroom environments in Korea, namely, the degree of implementation of constructivism, the pattern of teacher-student interactions, and the learning environment in laboratory classes. Based on the realisation that teacher-student interactions have not been systematically dealt with especially at the senior high school level in Korea, this article pays particularly attention to this aspect. The intention was also to provide useful insights for improving the current situation in senior high school science classrooms in Korea. © 2003 National Science Council, Taiwan.","Asian studies; Classroom environment; Questionnaire on teacher interaction; Stream differences; Teacher-student interactions",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18844361896

This paper analyses 11-12 year-old English children's responses to two 'realistic' problems. The first is taken from English national tests; the second is a revised version of this item which has been rewritten to encourage a more realistic pattern of responses. Through a comparison of responses to the two items it is suggested that, given suitable 'realistic' problems, many children may be more willing and able to introduce realistic responses in a testing context than earlier research might lead us to expect. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345424649

This paradigm is contrasted with landscapes of investigation serving as invitations for students to be involved in processes of exploration and explanation. The distinction between the exercise paradigm and landscapes of investigation is combined with a distinction between three different types of reference which might provide mathematical concepts and classroom activities with meaning: references to mathematics; references to a semi-reality; and references to a real-life situation. The six possible learning milieus are illustrated by examples. Moving away from the exercise paradigm and in the direction of landscapes of investigation may help to abandon the authorities of the traditional mathematics classroom and to make students the acting subjects in their learning processes. Moving away from reference to pure mathematics and in the direction of real life references may help to provide resources for reflection on mathematics and its applications. My hope is that finding a route among the different milieus of learning may provide new resources for making the students both acting and reflecting and in this way providing mathematics education with a critical dimension.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27944489082

Together with political investment in general and further education, practitioners and theoreticians focus on 'knowing and learning in different contexts'. Jean Lave's theory about 'situated learning' may be regarded as a confrontation with the idea of learning as acquisition of propositional knowledge. One characteristic of adult education in mathematics is that the participants bring with them adult life experience from their everyday and work. Another characteristic is their perspective in educating themselves. There is an apparent contradiction between many adults being blocked in relation to mathematics in formal settings and being competent in their everyday life. It is possible to make sense of this contradiction by analytically expanding the context for knowing and learning mathematics from the participants' experiences and perspectives to also include the adults' dispositions, cf. Pierre Bourdieu's concept of 'habitus' as a guiding principle for practice. By interpreting the account of her life by a 75 year old woman concerning her attitudes to mathematics, the author illustrates and discusses the two analytical concepts ('situated learning' and 'habitus') and their suitability for analysing adults knowing or not-knowing mathematics in different situation contexts. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Adults and mathematics; Habitus; Knowing mathematics in context; Lifelong learning; Maths life history; Situated learning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846159251

The framework can be used to think about the content and organization of a particular lesson or of an entire course or program for teachers. Further, it describes the interconnection between different domains of teacher knowledge. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010322905

Florida and Puerto Rico secondary science teachers who claim to teach extensively about climate change were surveyed in regard to their conceptions of climate change science and the climate change-related topics they teach. Results show that many teachers hold naïve views about climate change (e.g. that ozone layer depletion is a primary cause of climate change) and climate change science (e.g. that it must be based on controlled experiments for it to be valid). In addition, teachers in both groups neglect crucial topics such as how evidence for climate change is developed and the social, political, and economic dimensions of climate change. Our results suggest the need for teachers to understand how to teach climate change and the nature of climate change science using authentic contexts that promote effective socioscientific decision-making and climate change mitigation. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Climate change education; Nature of science; Science teacher education; Secondary school science",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948137092

It takes as a starting point a previous survey, commissioned for ICME 10 in 2004 that focused on Mathematics Teacher Education. The current survey focuses centrally on teachers involved in collaborations, sometimes in formal settings of professional development, but also in a more diverse range of collaborative settings including research initiatives. The roles of teachers involved in the collaboration, survey methods, decisions and limitations are described. While some of the findings to date resonate with those of the earlier survey, other findings highlight characteristics and issues relating to the differing ways in which teachers collaborate, either with other teachers or the various ‘others’, most notably mathematics teacher educator researchers. The roles and relationships that contribute to learning in such collaborations, as well as theories and methodologies found in survey sources, are a focus of the findings presented here. Studies rarely theorised collaboration, and few of those that did so reported explicitly on how their theoretical frame shaped the design of research methodologies/approaches guiding activities with teachers. One significant outcome has been the difficulty of relating teachers’ learning to collaboration within a project, although many initiatives report developments in teaching, teacher learning and students’ learning. © 2016, The Author(s).","Community of inquiry; Community of practice; Lesson study; Mathematics teaching; Mathematics teaching development; Teacher collaboration; Teacher learning; Teacher professional development",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978033509

The present study examined this hypothesis by focusing on the specificity of the home numeracy environment. In a sample of 60 kindergartners, we assessed cognitive (nonverbal reasoning, working memory) and linguistic abilities (phonological awareness, grammatical skills), as well as early numeracy skills, while exploring their home literacy environment and home numeracy environment from parent questionnaires. We found that home numeracy environment predicted early numeracy skills, after controlling for child factors and home literacy environment.

Many studies of children’s experiences in school show that a child’s academic success is a product of many factors, some of which are beyond the control and, sometimes, the knowledge of the classroom teacher. We draw on the sociological ideas of Pierre Bourdieu to frame our analysis of the environment in which the pupils learn and the ways in which the practices help to create parallel worlds which are structured quite differently inside and outside the classroom. Specifically, we use Bourdieu’s notions of habitus, field and capital. Using two cases, we highlight the subtle and coercive ways in which the practices of the field of mathematics education allow greater or lesser access to the hegemonic knowledge known as school mathematics depending on the cultural backgrounds and dispositions of the learners. We examine the children’s mathematical learning trajectories and reflect on how what they achieve in the future will, in all likelihood, be shaped by their social background and how compatible this is with the current educational climate. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bourdieu; Capital; Equity; Field; Habitus; Sociology",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911007408

In this study, we compare future-oriented mathematical identity work through a narrative framework considering six pre-service teachers undergoing two different teacher education programs. All pre-service teachers reported having had negative experiences with mathematics during their school years. Based on the results we conclude that despite the striking similarities in pre-service teachers' mathematical backgrounds, the ways in which these cases are conducting their identity work differ substantially.

Drawing on the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga and the Austrian philosopher Robert Pfaller, I show that this activity can be seen as a form of play or game, where it is pretended that mathematics is useful in real life in a way that it is not. With Pfaller, I argue that play can take hold of the imagination of the players, infusing everyday life with meaning borrowed from the imagery of the play and that these effects are more powerful when the play is forced and takes an institutionalized form. I show that mathematics education does in fact have these characteristics, including sophisticated mechanisms for translating in-game performance (test scores) to real-life goods (grades and examinations). A central theme of the article is the perceived discrepancy between mathematics education as it is, and how it supposedly could and should be in light of the properties of mathematics. The analysis implies that this gap actually is an effect of play and thus an inherent property of mathematics education itself. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Althusser; Ideology; Pfaller; Play; Reform; Word problems",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859265380

In addition, it contains a new facet, individual considerations of aptness, which accounts for the posers' comprehensions of implicit requirements of a problem-posing task and reflects their assumptions about the relative importance of these requirements. The framework is first argued theoretically. The framework at work is illustrated by its application to a situation, in which two groups of high-school students with similar background were given the same problem-posing task, but acted very differently. The novelty and usefulness of the framework is attributed to its three main features: it supports fine-grained analysis of directly observed problem-posing processes, it has a confluence nature, it attempts to account for hidden mechanisms involved in students' decision making while posing problems. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Considerations of aptness; Group dynamics; Mathematical problem posing; Problem posing strategies; Small group interactions; Task organization",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155162841

Yet mathematics anxiety has been a prevalent concern among educators and others in our society for decades. Some students tend to be more anxious about the testing process and can often freeze up, others just cringe when they are confronted with any form of computational exercise, or others dread taking math classes which can occur in the elementary, middle, high, and even at the college levels. Educators, parents, politicians, and others are trying to assess the cause for the apparent academic weakness of mathematics, and solutions to the problem are being sought. Our focus in this paper is to tease apart the underlying causes of math anxiety that result from a teacher's instructional practice, particularly how mastery and performance goals relate to the construct of math anxiety, and how a teachers' understanding of creating mastery-oriented classrooms can help to prevent or reduce the anxiety students experience during mathematics. Research indicates that classroom practices can influence the goals students adopt, and that educators should strive to create mastery-oriented classrooms by examining the nature of the tasks they assign students, the authority or degree they involve students in academic decision-making, the types of evaluation and recognition they utilize, and the classroom climate they create. © 2011 by ESER.","Attitudes; Career choice; Decision making; Goal orientation; Mastery learning; Math anxiety; STEM fields; Teaching strategies",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856532899

Analyses of 2 middle school classroom excerpts focusing on area-1 that derives triangle area formulas from the rectangle area formula and another that connects parallelogram and rectangular area-are used to delineate the method. Descriptions of similarities and differences in the classroom discourse highlight how, in each classroom, mathematical terms such as base and height were used in semantically related but distinct ways.

Following the seminal idea of Vygotsky, and elaborating on it, we postulate that an artifact can be exploited by the teacher as a tool of semiotic mediation to develop genuine mathematical signs, that are detached from the use of the artifact, but that nevertheless maintain with it a deep semiotic link. The teaching organization proposed in this paper is modeled by what we have called the didactical cycle. Starting from assuming the centrality of semiotic activities, collective mathematical discussion plays a crucial role: during a mathematical discussion the intentional action of the teacher is focused on guiding the process of semiotic mediation leading to the expected evolution of signs. The focus of the paper is on the role of the teacher in the teaching- learning process centered on the use of artifacts and in particular a dynamic geometry environment. Some examples will be discussed, drawn from a long-term teaching experiment, carried out over the past years as part of a National project.

We describe and compare four perspectives-mathematics, mathematics education, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology-each offering a different view on mathematical thinking and learning and, in particular, on the source of mathematical errors and on ways of dealing with them in the classroom. The four perspectives represent four levels of explanation, and we see them not as competing but as complementing each other. In the classroom or in research data, all four perspectives may be observed. They may differentially account for the behavior of different students on the same task, the same student in different stages of development, or even the same student in different stages of working on a complex task. We first introduce each of the perspectives by reviewing its basic ideas and research base. We then show each perspective at work, by applying it to the analysis of typical mathematical misconceptions.

This article describes the characteristics of a preservice programme aiming at this goal and presents an analysis of the development of the student teachers' views of mathematics and mathematics education during the programme as well as their classroom behaviour. This analysis is based on two research studies. The first was a longitudinal study in which the student teachers were followed during 4 1/2 years by means of questionnaires and interviews. The second was a study in which graduates from this programme were compared with graduates from a more traditional preparation programme by means of two teacher questionnaires and a pupil questionnaire, the latter measuring the pupils' perceptions of the actual teaching behaviour of the graduates. The teacher education programme appeared to be successful in changing the student teachers' views of mathematics education, especially in the direction of a more inquiry oriented approach, and in promoting effective teacher behaviour in the classroom. As far as their facilitating role as a teacher is concerned, the student teachers seemed to go through a two-stage learning process. Most of them reached the first stage, in which they realize that pupils have different preferences for learning and that a variety of possible explanations for problems should be offered. However, only a small number of student teachers seem to reach the second stage, in which they recognize the principle of building on pupils' own constructions, an important feature of realistic mathematics education. Possible explanations for the low impact of the programme, as well as solutions are discussed. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0013153576

Freudenthal laid the foundation for this didactical realism and determined the development of various learning strands, but more indirectly than directly because he himself did not design or outline themes and learning strands. Attention is devoted briefly to the integral educational development of Wiskobas and Freudenthal's contribution to it, especially in terms of developmental research. The summary, in conclusion, is given by way of a problem that was posed by Freudenthal - his last one. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843121388

To address this gap in the literature, this study analyzed a middle school life science teacher’s enactment of three design-focused life science units and student performances over a 3-year period. Findings indicate that the design and enactment of each unit reflects a unique engineering integration approach: add on, implicit, and explicit. Moreover, the ways the teacher talked about engineering varied among each curriculum unit. Through the analyses of 330 students’ pre- and post-content tests and interest surveys as well as videotaped classroom instruction, we found that explicit engineering integration and engineering language use in classroom instruction resulted in higher student learning gains in science and engineering, but they did not have significant effects on students’ interest in science and engineering.

Collectively, these alternative views suggest that specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge cannot be comprehensively accounted for by ‘what’ teachers know, but rather by ‘how’ teachers’ knowing comes into being.

Deliberate practice is practice that intentionally aims at improving one’s skills and competencies. It is not a mechanical or repetitive process of making performance more fluid. Instead, it involves a great deal of thinking, problem solving, and reflection for analyzing, conceptualizing, and cultivating developing performance. This includes directing and guiding future training efforts that are then fine-tuned to dynamically evolving levels of performance. Expertise studies, particularly in music and sport, have described early forms of deliberate practice among children. These findings are made use of in our analysis of the various forms of practice in school mathematics. It is widely accepted that mathematics learning requires practice that results in effortless conducting of lower level processes (such as quick and accurate whole number arithmetic with small numbers), which relieve cognitive capacity for more complex tasks. However, the typical training of mathematical skills in educational contexts can be characterized as drill-and-practice that helps automatize basic skills, but often leads to inert routine skills instead of adaptive and flexible number knowledge. In this article we summarize findings of studies which describe students’ self-initiated, deliberate practice in learning number knowledge and intervention studies applying deliberate practice in mathematics teaching, including technology-based learning environments aimed at triggering practice that goes beyond mechanical repeating of number skills. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025453713

We conceptualise the lesson plan as a boundary object and use this to illustrate how professional learning takes place through the introduction of carefully designed artefacts that draw on teachers’ professional knowledge of potential student approaches, and to the nature of progression in problem-solving processes. We identify the roles of instrumentalisation and instrumentation in supporting professional learning as these artefacts are prepared for use before a lesson and as they are again used as catalysts for reflection in post-lesson discussions. These artefacts are seen to effectively facilitate the socially situated learning of all participants. We conclude that the design of artefacts as boundary objects that support teaching and professional learning in their respective activity systems may be fundamental to the success of lesson study as a collaborative venture. © 2015, The Author(s).","Cultural-historical activity theory; Lesson study; Problem solving; Task design",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947428110

It focuses on adults’ numeracy and discusses its conceptualisation and assessment in the Project for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which is the most recent survey. Drawing on critical theoretical resources about new forms of governance in education and transformations in the pedagogic discourse, the paper further substantiates existing critiques of global policy trends, namely that they are motivated by human capital approaches to education and LLL. In particular, we show that the apparently commonsensical appeal of evaluative instruments like PISA and PIAAC is based on a competency model of knowledge, which embodies a narrow notion of competence. Relatedly, the notional curricula promoted by such surveys potentially articulate a more radical idea of LLL, captured by Bernstein’s conception of trainability as the mode of socialisation into a Totally Pedagogised Society. The paper presents a dual approach to understanding international adult performance surveys in general—in that, besides deploying the theoretical resources already indicated, it also raises a number of methodological issues relevant to the valid interpretation of these studies’ results. Ultimately, it argues for the importance of mobilising resources from critical educational perspectives to support the development of potentially powerful knowledge like numeracy and to prevent its being reduced to a narrow competency. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adult numeracy; Competency models of knowledge; Global educational policy; International assessment surveys; Pedagogic discourse; PIAAC; Survey methodology; Totally Pedagogised Society; Trainability",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911007985

Qualitative techniques were employed to classify responses to 5 items using conceptualizations of slope identified across various research settings. Students' responses suggest that they rely on procedurally based conceptualizations of slope, showing little evidence of covariational reasoning. In contrast, instructors' responses demonstrated a multi-dimensional understanding of slope as a functional property, which applies to real-world situations and plays an integral role in the development of key calculus concepts. While relatively diverse, the instructors' responses seldom reported determining increasing or decreasing trends of a line from its slope. This conceptualization was used frequently by students and could help them better understand how slope ties to positive and negative derivatives. The most frequently used conceptualizations for students in this study align with past research findings on the emphasis of the secondary mathematics curriculum, supporting the possibility of cultural influences (academic and geographic) on individuals' conceptualizations of slope. Thus, this study provides valuable insight into conceptualizations of slope and provides direction for future research on slope and the broader topic of cultural influences on mathematical meaning. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","instructors; school-to-university transition; slope; sociomathematical norms; students",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890438500

We studied the micro-level interventions that teachers implement spontaneously as a lesson unfolds, which we call micro-interventions. In particular, we focused on teachers' micro-interventions around trouble spots, defined as points during the lesson when students display lack of understanding. We investigated how teachers use gestures along with speech in responding to such trouble spots in a corpus of six middle-school mathematics lessons. Trouble spots were a regular occurrence in the lessons (M = 10.2 per lesson). We hypothesized that, in the face of trouble spots, teachers might increase their use of gestures in an effort to re-establish shared understanding with students. Thus, we predicted that teachers would gesture more in turns immediately following trouble spots than in turns immediately preceding trouble spots. This hypothesis was supported with quantitative analyses of teachers' gesture frequency and gesture rates, and with qualitative analyses of representative cases. Thus, teachers use gestures adaptively in micro-interventions in order to foster common ground when instructional communication breaks down. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.","Classroom communication; Common ground; Gesture",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891654313

Beginning with a quote from a teacher that provoked a focus on the role and nature of in-the-moment choices made in the midst of teaching, we offer some comments provoked in us. Following a concise history of attempts to articulate 'mathematics needed for teaching', three further brief accounts of incidents led us to propose that what really matters, in the words of Heidegger and others, is one's 'mathematical being', because it orients awareness and is the source and basis for choices, whether consciously or unconsciously made. The development of mathematical being is described using the discourse of awareness in the sense of Gattegno, making use of the discipline of noticing to educate awareness. These are then used to extend the analysis of prepositional suffixes for the gerund knowing begun by Ryle in order to focus on the development of 'connective tissue' between mathematical awareness and in-the-moment pedagogical choices of actions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879153762

From our analysis, it appears that this design, especially prediction tasks, helped in promoting the students’ probabilistic language. Initially, the students oscillated between certainty-only (deterministic) and uncertainty-only (relativistic) statements. As they engaged further in their inquiries, they came to talk in more sophisticated ways with increasing awareness of what is at stake, using what can be seen as buds of probabilistic language. Attending to students’ emerging articulations of uncertainty in making judgments about patterns and trends in data may provide an opportunity to develop more sophisticated understandings of statistical inference. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2012.","Chance; Growing samples; Informal statistical inference; Probabilistic language; Statistical reasoning; Uncertainty",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898538573

In the first part of the article, I argue that contemporary concepts of emancipation are explicitly or implicitly related to the idea of the sovereign subject articulated by Kant and other philosophers of the Enlightenment. I contend that our modern enlightened concepts of emancipation rest on a dichotomy between an autonomous and self-sufficient subject and its sociocultural world. Referring to current research in mathematics education, I show how this dichotomy leads to intrinsic contradictions that haunt ongoing educational practices. These contradictions, I contend, are manifested in the hopeless efforts to bridge the gap between the deeds and thoughts of an autonomous individual and the regimes of reason and truth in which the individual finds itself subsumed. In particular, I argue that emancipation as understood in the enlightened modern sense remains a chimeric and unfulfillable dream. In the second part of the article, I suggest that emancipation can still be an orienting vector of educational practice and research, but it needs to be conceptualized differently: emancipation needs not be predicated in terms of individuals' freedom and individualist autonomy, but in critical-ethical terms. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arendt; Communal ethics; Emancipation; Foucault; Marx; Presence in the world",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859264437

To answer the first question, teachers responded to two questionnaires: Views of Science Inquiry which gauged teachers' views about science and how science is conducted and Attitudes and Beliefs about the Nature of and the Teaching of Science which measured teacher's attitudes and beliefs about the nature of and the teaching of science. To answer the second question, classroom observations documented actual teaching practices. Results from the questionnaires and the observation were used to construct individual teacher's profiles which were used to identify relationships between teachers' beliefs, knowledge, and teaching practices.

We studied students' representational fluency, defined as their abilities to work within and translate among representations. While students translated across representations to address task demands, they also translated to a different representation when reaching an impasse, where the initial representation could not be used to answer a task. During these impasse events, which we call representational disfluencies, three categories of behavior were observed. Some students perceived the graph to be bounded by its physical and numerical limits, and these students were categorized as physically grounded. A second, related, disfluency was categorized as spatially grounded. Students who were classified as spatially grounded exhibited a bounded view of the graph that limited their ability to make far predictions until they physically altered the spatial configuration of the graph by rescaling or extending the axes. Finally, students who recovered from one or more of these disfluencies by translating the quantitative information to alternative but equivalent representations (i.e., exhibiting representational fluency), while retaining the connection back to the linear pattern as graphed, were categorized as interpretatively grounded. Understanding the causes and varieties of representational fluency and disfluency contributes directly to our understanding of mathematics knowledge, learning and adaptive forms of reasoning.

Numerous explanations were offered to reveal the paradox (Morrison in Educ J, 2006), and there were challenges of whether there is ""over- Confucianisation"" in all these discussions (Chang in J Psychol Chin Soc, 2000; Wong and Wong in Asian Psychol, 2002).

One of the foci of the debate is the basic skills-higherorder thinking ""dichotomy"". Viewing from the perspective of the process of mathematisation, teaching mathematics is more than striking a balance between the two, but to bridge basic skills to higher-order thinking competences.

Data were collected from 12 schools twice: in 1988 and in 2004 by interviewing 47 Mathematics teachers. The interview included questions related to teachers' understanding of critical thinking, its role and importance in learning Mathematics, and instructional strategies that could help improve students' critical thinking skills. Results found no improvement in secondary Mathematics teachers' perceptions of critical thinking despite 15 years of educational reform. The majority of Mathematics teachers seemed not to have a clear and adequate understanding of critical thinking. Though most of the teachers claimed they have to teach critical thinking, more than half of them could not suggest any learning situation that could help in fostering critical thinking in Mathematics classes. Also most of the teachers claimed that critical thinking would help students in learning Mathematics; yet less than half were able to give a convincing justification for that. A small percentage of the secondary Mathematics teachers believed they can help all students to foster their critical thinking. It is thus recommended that the concept of critical thinking be transferred from the realm of rhetoric to the field of practice.

The results of the analysis suggest that as the teacher listened to her students, she developed a sophisticated schema for understanding the diversity of student thinking. The actions of the teacher supported extensive student engagement with the task and led the students to revise and refine their own mathematical thinking.

The paper focuses on the case of one student (Tim) in the teacher's 6th grade class who was interviewed by one of the authors once a week during the teaching of the unit. The teaching materials and the teacher's instruction were based on the assumption that students understood the concept of a unit fraction as being one of several equal parts of a given whole. The teacher neither emphasized the need for equal parts nor the part-to-whole relation. The teacher's reasonable assumptions about her students' understanding of fractions were severely challenged by the cognitive constructs that Tim exhibited during his first two interviews. When she viewed tapes of the class instruction and the interviews with Tim she realized Tim lacked essential constructs to make sense of her instruction. She subsequently made adjustments in her instruction, making effective use of more appropriate representations based on tasks from the unit that we modified and used with Tim in our interviews. These adjustments helped Tim to construct partitioning operations and an appropriate unit fractional scheme. This study illustrates the importance of coming to understand a student's mathematical activity in terms of possible conceptual schemes and modifying instructional strategies to build on those schemes.

Multiple data sources and data collection methods were utilized in an effort to provide rich insights into preservice teachers' mathematical understandings. A questionnaire consisting of six tasks was administered to the sample of 263 preservice teachers. When solving the tasks, participants were asked to provide an explanation of the reasoning surrounding their choice of strategy. Following analysis of the data, a sample of preservice teachers participated in individual clinical interviews. The results highlighted that 57% of the participants correctly utilized the mean to compare two data sets, 21% provided an accurate answer to a weighted means problem, and 88% constructed a data set to reflect a pre-given mean value. Approximately one fourth of the students indicated some form of conceptual understanding of the mean, with the remaining demonstrating limited computational-based understanding. Almost 25% confused the mean with the mode in either narrative description of the mean or through identification of the mean on a graphical representation. The complexities of trying to distinguish procedural and conceptual understanding of the mean are examined. Implications for preservice teacher education are discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Elementary education; Statistics education; Teacher content knowledge; Teacher education; The mean",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746415666

Reston, VA: The Council). The type of rich learning contexts that are envisaged by such reforms are predicated on a number of factors, not the least of which is the quality of teachers' experience and knowledge in the domain of mathematics. Although the study of teacher knowledge has received considerable attention, there is less information about the teachers' content knowledge that impacts on classroom practice. Ball (2000, Journal of Teacher Education, 51(3), 241-247) suggested that teachers' need to 'deconstruct' their content knowledge into more visible forms that would help children make connections with their previous understandings and experiences. The documenting of teachers' content knowledge for teaching has received little attention in debates about teacher knowledge. In particular, there is limited information about how we might go about systematically characterising the key dimensions of quality of teachers' mathematics knowledge for teaching and connections among these dimensions. In this paper we describe a framework for describing and analysing the quality of teachers' content knowledge for teaching in one area within the domain of geometry. An example of use of this framework is then developed for the case of two teachers' knowledge of the concept 'square'. © Springer 2005.","Framework for geometric knowledge mapping; Geometric knowledge; Mathematics teacher knowledge for teaching; Teacher education; Teachers' knowledge deconstruction",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844511445

Consequently, there is a need to incorporate alternative methods of assessment that are able to effectively assess the range of students' mathematical abilities. The present study investigated methods of assessment used by 60 mathematics teachers from 11 secondary schools in metropolitan Sydney, as well as their attitudes to a range of alternative assessment methods, together with reasons why they would or would not implement these. Results showed that teachers were satisfied with traditional tests as valid measures of student ability, particularly for senior school years. Teachers generally did not favour implementing alternative assessment methods, although those with the least years' teaching experience reported more positive attitudes. A major concern raised by teachers about the use of alternative assessment methods related to their perceived subjectivity.

It is, however, primarily suited for algorithmic content areas. We propose the concept of using heuristic worked-out examples, which do not provide an algorithmic problem solution but offer instead heuristic steps that lead towards finding a proof.

The aim of this article is to examine the multiple voices of educational reform in the discourse of a third grade classroom community. In order to achieve our aim, we integrated the social and the individual as well as the past, present, and future in our analysis of the discourse in this classroom community using theoretical frameworks and methods from cultural psychology. Although our analyses focused on the classroom teacher, we employed units of analysis capable of bridging the individual and her social context. We began our analysis by focusing on a sample of whole-class discussions of students' strategies for solving multi-digit word problems. This analysis isolated two distinct voices: one that occurred during discussions of students' invented strategies and the other that emerged during talk about standard algorithms. We extended our analysis to include information about the historical, social, and institutional context of the classroom community in order to understand the origins and functions of these two voices. This additional information helped us appreciate the interconnections between the teacher's personal feelings, beliefs, recollections, and expectations; and her interpersonal transactions with her students, their parents, and other educators. We concluded with a discussion of the implications of the study for understanding one of the dilemmas of educational reform and for advancing research in classroom discourse. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Classroom discourse; Cultural psychology; Elementary mathematics; Research in mathematics education; Social practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17344373586

Instead, I analyse why transfer is problematical in principle, and undependable in practice. I recommend an alternative approach for building bridges between practices, based on analysing the discourses involved as systems of signs, and looking for appropriate points of inter-relation between them.

We argue that through the medium of the computer, the objects in the graphical, tabular and algebraic settings can change their essence and thus become objects of a new kind we call representatives. Actions on representatives which naturally arise in this framework induce an ontological shift. A taxonomy of the skills involved in the learning of the concept of function through these new ontological lenses is presented, as well as software, and problem solving tasks that embody the same ontological perspective. Within the framework of a teaching experiment, students' acquisition of many of the identified skills was investigated by means of a questionnaire and interviews during computer supported problem solving sessions. The most salient results of the study indicate that a majority of students were able (1) to cope with partial data about functions (e.g., problems of interpolation and arbitrariness), (2) to recognize invariants (i. e., properties of functions) while coordinating actions among representatives from different settings, and (3) to recognize invariants while creating and comparing different representatives from the same setting. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000993778

In a substantial number of studies, the theory has been used to analyze teaching and students’ learning in classrooms. In mathematics education, variation theory has also been used to explore variation in sets of instructional examples. For example, it has been reported how teachers, by using variation and invariance within and between examples, can help learners to engage with mathematical structure. In this paper, we describe the variation theory of learning, its underlying principles, and how it might be appropriated by teachers. We illustrate this by an analysis of one teacher’s teaching before and after he participated in three lesson studies based on variation theory. Both the theory and the empirical illustration focus on ‘what is made possible to learn’ in different learning situations. We show that in the two analyzed lessons, different things were made possible to learn. © 2017, The Author(s).","Algebra; Learning study; Lesson study; Mathematics; Teacher collaboration; Teaching; Variation theory",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025477149

In supporting our argument, we use two frameworks: one curricular and one pedagogical. The curricular framework is based on the work of Hammerness et al. (Preparing teachers for a changing world. What teachers should learn and be able to do. San Francisco, Jossey-Bass Educational Series, pp 358–388, 2005) outlining four main goals of teacher learning: a vision of practice, knowledge of students and content, dispositions for using this knowledge, and a repertoire of practices and tools. The pedagogical framework is based on the work of Grossman et al. (Teach Teach Theory Pract 15(2):273–289, 2009a; Teach Coll Record 111(9):2055–2100, 2009b) outlining three pedagogies of practice: representations, decompositions, and approximations of practice. We use the curricular framework to examine the opportunities for teacher learning that were afforded by these three different pedagogies of practice in a unit on leading classroom mathematics discussion in a secondary mathematics methods course. We use evidence from our analysis to show how the coordination of those pedagogies of practice is better than any one of them in addressing important goals for teacher learning about classroom discussions. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Classroom discussions; Enactment; Instructional practices; Reflection",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981502718

A big source of difficulty is the inappropriate application of natural number knowledge. The research literature points at three main aspects where natural number knowledge is inappropriately applied: density, operations, and size. While there are numerous test instruments to assess each of these aspects, none of them combines all aspects in an integrated manner. By creating such a comprehensive test instrument and applying it to fourth graders, we found that the strength of the natural number bias was largest in density items, but still clearly present in items about size and operations. We further found that fourth graders’ rational number reasoning—more specifically their ability to inhibit the inappropriate use of natural number knowledge—can be described by a one-dimensional construct. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Conceptual change; Item response theory; Natural number bias; Rational numbers",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940032894

The country provides a somewhat different context for exploring the relationship between SES and education than other countries. The apartheid era only ended in 1994, after which education became the vehicle for transforming society and a political rhetoric of equity and quality education for all was prioritized. Thus education focused on redressing inequalities; and major curriculum change, with on-going revisions, was attempted. In this sense engagement with SES and education became foregrounded in policy, political discourse and research literature. Yet for all the political will and rhetoric little has been achieved and indicators are that inequality has worsened in mathematics education, where it is particularly pronounced. This paper proposes that continued research confirming poverty–underachievement links, which suggest an inevitability of positive correlations, is unhelpful. Instead we should explore issues of disempowerment and agency, constraints and possibilities, and the complex interplay of factors that create these widely established national statistics while simultaneously defying them in particular local contexts. Such research could shift the focus from a discourse of deficit and helplessness towards a discourse of possibilities in the struggle for equity and quality education for all. © 2013, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Inequality; Performance; Redress; SES",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919917029

These shifts concern the lecturers' and students' communicative practices, routines of constructing mathematical objects and ways of resolving commognitive conflicts. We then propose that commognitive constructs such as subjectification can be deployed towards 'scaling-up' the hitherto fine-grained focus of commognitive analyses.

This study is theoretically aligned with self-regulated learning research. Clearly, academic performance is closely related to student motivational beliefs and learning strategies. This study investigated the motivational beliefs and learning strategies of 2 years of college students in the second semester of organic chemistry. Responses to the Motivational Beliefs and Learning Strategies Questionnaire indicated that student self-efficacy was highly correlated with academic performance (semester grades). Gender differences were quite pronounced. Male academic performance was associated with intrinsic motivation as well as the importance placed on the learning task. Test anxiety was negatively associated with male grades. Extrinsic motivation was negatively correlated with female grades. Responses to students' sense of control over learning, the value of the learning task, and self-efficacy were significantly higher for males compared to females. Faculty who attend to these different patterns may influence beliefs as well as learning strategies. Correcting erroneous assumptions about how to learn chemistry may help students shift both their attitudes and their learning practices. The notable gender difference suggests that female chemistry students may especially profit from focused faculty intervention. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.","first or second year undergraduate; learning strategies; organic chemistry; student attitudes",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82755194948

The first and most common incident reflection occurs as specific incidents or episodes unconnected to future activity. The second process reflection-based on the work of John Dewey and Donald Schön-connects reflective incidents into a cyclic progression that refines ideas through experimental action. I examined the reflective activity of a group of prospective secondary mathematics teachers as they jointly planned a public school lesson to illustrate how incidents of reflection can be refined and linked into more powerful and purposeful progressions of ideas.

Metacognitive 'events' were identified and the children's behaviour was analysed for indications of metacognitive thinking. At the same time, the pedagogical context of the activities, including interventions by adult practitioners, was analysed in relation to the metacognitive opportunities afforded. Findings were that the young children did indeed show evidence, through their talk, and their non-verbal actions, of emergent metacognitive processes, and that the nature and frequency of these processes were influenced by pedagogical aspects of the mathematical activities. In particular, pedagogical interactions which provided children in this age range with emotionally contingent support, which gave them feelings of autonomy and control, which provided them with cognitive challenges and the opportunity to articulate their thinking appeared to provoke and support metacognitive and self-regulatory behaviours. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867542502

This article moves beyond disparate questions of use and practice to examine interactions between teachers and curricula as evidenced by their enactments of whole-number lessons from a Standards-based curriculum. Specifically, we analyze videorecorded 1st- and 2nd-grade classroom lessons in terms of students' opportunities to reason and communicate about mathematics. This analysis indicates that the level of fidelity to the written curriculum differs from the level of fidelity to the authors' intended curriculum during lesson enactments.

Employing evidence from lesson observation and teacher interview, such practice was investigated in greater depth through case study of two teachers each teaching two lessons of this type. The practitioner model developed in earlier research (Ruthven & Hennessy, Educational Studies in Mathematics 49(1):47-88, 2002; Micromath 19(2):20-24, 2003) provided a framework for synthesising teacher thinking about the contribution of graphing software. Further analysis highlighted the crucial part played by teacher prestructuring and shaping of technology-and-task-mediated student activity in realising the ideals of the practitioner model. Although teachers consider graphing software very accessible, successful classroom use still depends on their inducting students into using it for mathematical purposes, providing suitably prestructured lesson tasks, prompting strategic use of the software by students and supporting mathematical interpretation of the results. Accordingly, this study has illustrated how, in the course of appropriating the technology, teachers adapt their classroom practice and develop their craft knowledge: particularly by establishing a coherent resource system that effectively incorporates the software; by adapting activity formats to exploit new interactive possibilities; by extending curriculum scripts to provide for proactive structuring and responsive shaping of activity; and by reworking lesson agendas to take advantage of the new time economy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Classroom teaching practice; Computer graphing software; Secondary-school mathematics; Teacher knowledge and thinking; Technology use and integration",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349234910

The extensive museum experience covered four aspects: the visit, discussion with museum educators, the development of lesson plans, and practising teaching in the science museum. Twenty-one pre-service science teachers attended this course. Qualitative methods were used for data collection and analysis. The data sources included field notes, reports, diaries, and interviews. The findings show that this course connecting museum resources and context had created a novel situation for pre-service science teachers to learn how to teach science. The discourses with the museum educators also provided them with innovations in education beyond the gains from traditional teacher education. Through developing and practising teaching activities, they improved their understanding of the meanings and effective ways to use museum resources in science teaching. Pre-service science teachers reported that getting feedback from peers and observing modeling teaching was helpful. This course provided an alternative way to view how scientific activities were developed for junior high students. In general, the use of museum settings provides a new profile of learning and teaching course for pre-service science teachers in Taiwan. Based on the findings, this study makes suggestions for those science teacher educators who would like to use science museum resources and contexts to nurture prospective science teachers. © 2004 National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China.","Museum settings; Pre-service science teacher; Science teacher education; Teaching methods course",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18844457858

Four American and four Japanese teachers watched a mathematics lesson - videotaped in either Nagano, Japan or Chicago, Illinois - and commented on the lesson's strengths and weaknesses. The major pedagogical issues that differentiated the teachers' comments were: what students should do during a lesson, how instructors should use language, how instructors should pace lessons and address ability differences, and how instructional materials should be used.

Understanding the significance of the risks and their subsequent study and assessment allows for timely adjustments in implementation of certain informational and educational technologies in the educational process. The paper focuses on the issues related to identification of the major risks while introducing and implementing educational innovations, and those related to introduction of the learning management system (LMS) in higher education institutions, their impact assessment and influence on the efficiency throughout the entire educational process. The results of the study have been summarized using risk mapping and sensitivity analysis methods. These methods allowed us to visualize the level of each risk distinguished in the study according to the degree of its influence on the educational process and probability of its occurrence. The study was based on the survey findings and students' interviews and aimed to identify whether they understand and realize the difficulties and complexities in the procedure of innovative technologies implementation by their university. The authors have developed a list of risks occurring while introducing and implementing innovations in the educational process which in their turn will reflect the peculiarities of the higher education institution using modern learning techniques. Moreover, the paper discusses the risk sensitivity study results. They are presented as an expert appraisal of risks related to their influence on the resultant as integrated assessment, i.e. the Wheel Model of risk management. In the course of the study it has been found that, despite the difficulties of innovation implementation, the innovative programs having been introduced improve the educational process and ensure appropriate quality of human capital, or workforce. Reasonable conclusions from the experience of the state-of the art innovation introduction into university teaching-learning process confirm its practical significance, its ability to encourage university students and increase their participation and independence in learning, thus contributing to development of their skills that meet the requirements of an economist position and in future will help them be successfully engaged into innovation economics.

Although researchers have accepted that abstraction is a central concept in computational thinking, they are quick to disagree on the meaning of it. A focus on reflective abstraction has led to the development of APOS Theory in Mathematics education. This has resulted in many cases of improved student learning in Mathematics (Arnon et al., 2013).

The results indicated there is significant difference in identifying and formulating evidence favoring science/applied science over non-science majors (p < .01). Quality of critical thinking associated with the strength of the arguments made indicated that science/applied science majors demonstrate significantly (p < 0.05) more advanced patterns than non-science majors.

However, identifying the nature of the mathematical knowledge and the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) required for effective teaching remains elusive (Ball et al. in J Teacher Educ 59:389-407, 2008). Building on the initial conceptual framework of Magnusson et al.

The PCK development of these two individuals varied due to their focus on developing particular aspects of their PCK, with one individual focusing on assessment and student understanding, and the other individual focusing on curricular knowledge. Our findings indicate that these individuals privileged particular aspects of their knowledge, leading to differences in their PCK development.

The authors then provide brief descriptions of critical theory and postmodern theory, and suggest critical postmodern theory as a hybrid theory that offers a praxis of uncertainty for reconceptualizing and conducting mathematics education research.

A cornerstone of the methodological approach that we develop is a close examination of classroom discourse. Our efforts to analyze the collective production of meaning by examining classroom interaction are compatible with the relatively recent emphasis in mathematics and science education research that focuses on how communities of learners establish ideas through discourse and inquiry. The methodological approach we take builds on and extends an approach from mathematics education that uses Toulmin's argumentation model to document and analyze students' conceptual progress. Our modification introduces a new criterion for empirically demonstrating when particular ways of reasoning become part of the normative practices of the community.

We then use this framework to analyze the reasoning of ten mathematicians and mathematics graduate students that were asked to read and make sense of an unfamiliar, but accessible, mathematical proof in the domain of geometric topology. We find that experts are more likely to refer to definitions when questioning or explaining some aspect of the focal mathematical idea and more likely to refer to specific examples or instantiations when making sense of an unknown aspect of that idea. However, in general, they employ a variety of types of mathematical resources simultaneously. Often, these combinations are used to deconstruct the mathematical idea in order to isolate, identify, and explore its subcomponents.

After the theory introduction, students indicated context-specific conceptions as well as the importance and familiarity of each theory. Study results show that higher familiarity with scientific theories is related to a more informed view about the general nature of science.

Accordingly, educators suggest a reformbased instruction to improve students' learning opportunities. In a study with 245 German third graders learning by textbooks with different instructional approaches, we investigate accuracy and adaptivity of students' strategy use when adding and subtracting three-digit numbers. The findings indicate that students often choose efficient strategies provided they know any appropriate strategies for a given problem. The proportion of appropriate and efficient strategies students use differs with respect to the instructional approach of their textbooks. Learning with an investigative approach, more students use appropriate strategies, whereas children following a problem-solving approach show a higher competence in adaptive strategy choice.

Particularly, it is stated that diagrams facilitate the solution of mathematical problems because they represent problems' structure and information (Novick & Hurley, 2001; Diezmann, 2005). Novick and Hurley were the first to introduce three well-defined types of diagrams, that is, network, hierarchy, and matrix, which represent different problematic situations. In the present study, we investigated the effects of these types of diagrams in non-routine mathematical problem solving by contrasting students' abilities to solve problems with and without the presence of diagrams. Structural equation modeling affirmed the existence of two first-order factors indicating the differential effects of the problems' representation, i.e., text with diagrams and without diagrams, and a second-order factor representing general non-routine problem solving ability in mathematics. Implicative analysis showed the influence of the presence of diagrams in the problems' hierarchical ordering. Furthermore, results provided support for other studies (e.g. Diezman & English, 2001) which documented some students' difficulties to use diagrams efficiently for the solution of problems.

The study further investigated the effects of the HACL and FCL methods on performance in scientific reasoning and conceptual understanding among students of two reasoning ability levels, namely empirical-inductive (EI) and hypothetical-deductive (HD). A quasi-experimental method that employed the 3 × 2 Factorial Design was applied in the study. The sample consisted of 301 Form Four students from 12 pure science classes in four Smart Schools which were all randomly selected and assigned to treatment (HACL & FCL) and control (TG) groups. The results showed that students in the HACL group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the FCL group who, in turn, significantly outperformed their counterparts in the TG group in scientific thinking and conceptual understanding. The findings of this study suggest that the inquiry-based computer simulation with heterogeneous-ability cooperative learning method is effective in enhancing scientific reasoning and conceptual understanding for students of all reasoning abilities, and for maximum effectiveness, cooperative learning groups should be composed of students of heterogeneous abilities.

We are particularly interested in the question of ""transparency"", a question that has been extensively considered in the general literature on tool use and, more recently, by Michael Roth and his colleagues in the context of scientific work. Roth uses the notion of transparency to characterise instances of graph use by highly educated scientists in cases where the context was familiar: the scientists were able to read the situation ""through"" the graph. This paper explores the limits of the validity of the transparency metaphor. We present two vignettes of actual graph use by a factory worker, and contrast his actions and knowledge with that of a highly qualified process engineer working on the same production line. We note that in neither case the graphs were transparent. We argue that a fuller account that describes a spectrum of transparency is needed, and we seek to achieve this by adopting some elements of a semiotic approach that enhance a strictly activity-theoretical view. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.","Graphs; Situated abstraction; Technology; Transparency; Workplace mathematical knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947727007

The findings in this study suggest that an individual's belief system impacts how they approach a problem. Lack of confidence and previous lack of success combined to prompt swift decisions to stop working. Further findings indicate that students continue with unsuccessful strategies when working on unfamiliar problems due to a perceived dependence of solution strategies to specific problem types. In this situation, the students persisted in an inappropriate solution strategy, never reaching a correct solution. Control decisions concerning the pursuit of alternative strategies are not an issue if the students are unaware that they might need to make different choices during their solutions.

Two premises lie behind this line of work. First, the creation and the use of representations are prominent activities in professional scientific practice. Thus, having students become proficient designers of representations appears to be a worthy goal. Second, students seem to possess a great deal of knowledge regarding ways of representing aspects of the world on paper, and such knowledge can be profitably used in learning canonical ways of representing landscapes. I pursue several parallel lines of analysis. First, I survey the representational forms students generate when engaged in open-ended design activities in which they are asked to create representations of terrain. Based on a categorization of students' works, I then present a preliminary identification of the knowledge implicated in the creation of such representational forms. We call this prior knowledge constructive resources. I describe two broad classes of constructive resources: drawing and the use of colors for representational purposes. In addition to constructive resources, I also preliminarily address students' use of criteria for judging the adequacy of their designs. Together with constructive resources, design criteria are main elements shaping students' performance in the proposed tasks.

Students evinced a progressive construction of imagery and concepts related to turns. They gained experience with physical rotations, especially rotations of their own bodies. In parallel, they gained limited knowledge of assigning numbers to certain turns, initially by establishing benchmarks. A synthesis of these two domains - turn-as-body-motion and turn-as-number - constituted a critical juncture in learning about turns for some students.

Since then, a host of new developments has taken place, and we—as the authors of the original report—have felt the need to take stock of this development and revisit the conceptualisation of the basic notions in order to provide an updated version of the original conceptual framework and terminology.

However, even today, the field of mathematics education has no clear answer to the question as to what kind of profession-specific CK secondary mathematics teachers need and should be taught during the course of their teacher education. Hence, a model of professional CK for teaching secondary mathematics is required which takes into account the discrepancy between the academic mathematics that teachers learn at university and the school mathematics they teach in school. In order to characterize such a profession-specific CK, this theoretical paper traces and integrates different approaches to bridge this gap. Consequently, a construct called school-related content knowledge (SRCK) is introduced, which describes a profession-specific CK for teaching secondary mathematics concerning interrelations between academic and school mathematics. The conceptualization of this construct encompasses three facets that are illustrated by means of a corresponding operationalization. The distinction of SRCK from the construct of specialized content knowledge is discussed, as are emerging research questions. © 2018, The Author(s).","A40; B50; D20; Elementary mathematics from a higher standpoint; Mathematics teacher education; Profession-specific content knowledge; Professional knowledge; School-related content knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050267136

As a bridging curriculum, it is essential to examine the curriculum with respect to high school and college students to highlight the differences in their knowledge and skills for improving curriculum development. Hence, we conducted a teaching experiment using a CO2-car engineering design curriculum in this study to analyze the learning outcomes of four groups of students (three 3D-printing groups: 108 high school students, 12 design college students, and 12 engineering college students; one handmade group: 36 high school students) to assess their competencies.

A meta-analysis of the literature on prompting self-explanation to improve mathematics learning confirmed that prompted self-explanation leads to a small to moderate improvement in procedural knowledge, conceptual knowledge and procedural transfer when assessed immediately after the intervention. However, evidence that self-explanation reliably promotes learning within a classroom context or retention of knowledge over a delay is much more limited. Moderator analyses indicated that the effect on immediate outcomes was stronger if scaffolding of high-quality explanation was provided but did not vary based on whether time on task was controlled across conditions. Based on the research literature, we propose instructional recommendations for mathematics educators: (a) scaffold high-quality explanations via training on self-explanation or structuring the self-explanation responses, (b) design explanation prompts so they do not sacrifice attention to other important content, (c) prompt learners to explain correct information, and (d) prompt learners to explain why common misconceptions are incorrect. We conclude with issues for future research, such as the need for additional research on effective use of self-explanation in classroom contexts and the merits of self-explanation relative to alternative instructional techniques. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Conceptual knowledge; Instructional practices; Learning strategies; Procedural knowledge; Self-explanation; Transfer",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025428332

This includes cultivating students to become proficient reasoners who can utilize proper scientific reasoning to devise causal inferences from observations. Conventionally, students with more years of higher education are expected to have a greater level of scientific reasoning. Also expected traditionally is that studying science and engineering or attending top-rated universities can better promote students’ scientific reasoning than studying other majors or attending lower ranked institutions. In this study, we used Lawson’s Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR) with 1,637 Chinese students in different years of study, different fields, and different university tiers. It was found that regardless of which major or university students entered, their scientific reasoning measured by the LCTSR showed little variation across the entire 4 years of undergraduate education. Simply put, there was little association between tertiary-level learning and scientific reasoning. This study calls our attention to the status quo of higher education and motivates researchers across the globe to look into this issue in their own nations. © 2014, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Content learning; Higher education; Scientific reasoning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916919976

Teachers usually use circular pies, rectangular shapes and number lines on the paper as teaching tools for fraction instruction. This article contributes to the field by investigating how the widely used three external graphical representations (i.e., circle, rectangle, number line) relate to students’ fractional knowledge and vice versa. For understanding this situation, a test using three representations with the same fractional knowledge framed within Fractional Scheme Theory was developed. Six-hundred and fifty-six 4th and 5th grade US students took the test. A statistical analysis of six fractional Problem Types, each with three external graphical representations (a total of 18 problems) was conducted. The findings indicate that students showed similar performance in circle and rectangle items that required using part-whole fractional reasoning, but students’ performance was significantly lower on the items with number line graphical representation across the Problem Types. In addition, regardless of the representation, their performance was lower on items requiring more advanced fractional thinking compared to part-whole reasoning. Possible reasons are discussed and suggestions for teaching fractions with graphical representations are presented. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Elementary school children; Fraction Scheme Theory; Fractions; Mathematical knowledge; Representations",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930382181

The four curriculum programs were developed to align with different theories of learning and mathematical goals and have strongly differing design features. Using findings of a large-scale, experimental study of the effects of the four curricula on student achievement as a backdrop, we analyzed the designs of the curriculum materials with respect to three analytical categories: (a) mathematical emphasis, (b) instructional approach, and (c) support for teachers. Results of the analysis reveal substantially different types of opportunities to learn across the four sets of materials. We hypothesize how these differences could explain the achievement results of the experimental study and point to additional influential factors to consider. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Curriculum effects; Curriculum material analysis; Opportunity to learn; Textbooks",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907511893

Prior analyses have shown that students who change their Calculus II intention (a proxy for STEM intention) report being less engaged during class than students who persist onto Calculus II. This led us to ask: Are these students in different classes, or are they in the same classes but experiencing them differently? We present descriptive and univariate analyses of the relationship of calculus persistence to student demographics, background characteristics, and reported instruction for 1,684 STEM intending students and 330 non-STEM intending students enrolled in introductory calculus in Fall 2010 in the United States. We then develop regression models that control for the group effect of course enrollment to understand how perceiving low levels of various pedagogical activities within a class is associated with calculus persistence. These analyses show that different student perceptions of the frequency of a number of pedagogical activities, and thus different ways of experiencing the same class, are related to students’ decision to continue studying calculus. Specifically, among initially STEM intending students, there was a relationship between persistence and the perceived frequency of the instructor showing students how to work specific problems, preparing extra material to help students understand calculus concepts or procedures, holding a whole-class discussion, and requiring students to explain their thinking on exams. Among initially non-STEM intending students, there was a relationship between persistence and the perceived frequency of being required to explain thinking during class. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Calculus instruction; Data analysis and statistics; Instructional activities and practices; Post-secondary education; Student persistence",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926282841

I argue that human cognition can only be understood as a culturally and historically constituted multimodal sentient form of creatively responding, acting, feeling, transforming, and making sense of the world.

For 5 years, lessons from bilingual mathematics classrooms in three public secondary schools were video-recorded and transcribed. In the presentation of findings, I discuss three language practices that emerged from the analyses of several classroom instances as follows: (1) caution with mathematical vocabulary, (2) invention of terms, and (3) word-for-word translation. One example is chosen to represent each practice and some of its situated effects. The first two examples support the view that the experience of language difficulties, either real or presumed, contributes to generating opportunities that may be beneficial to mathematics learning. The third example, where the focus on the mathematics is hindered, points to a contrasting finding. Unlike other studies in the field, which have reported the difficulties and obstacles that arise in learning and teaching due to bilingualism in the classroom, I propose a change of focus through the conceptualization of language as a potential for thinking and doing, and particularly for learning and teaching mathematics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bilingual students; Classroom data; Language-as-resource; Mathematics learning opportunities",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905122683

The nature of various strategies used by these teachers provides further illustration of a secure common content knowledge that can serve as a benchmark for the development of mathematics courses for prospective teachers.

This paper documents the range of purposes identified by 12 middle grades teachers who were working actively to incorporate justification into their classrooms and compares this set of purposes with those documented in the research mathematician community. Results indicate that the teachers viewed justification as a powerful practice to accomplish a range of valued classroom teaching and learning functions. Some of these purposes overlapped with the purposes in the mathematician community; others were unique to the classroom community. Perhaps surprisingly, absent was the role of justification in verifying mathematical results. An analysis of the relationship between the purposes documented in the mathematics classroom community and the research mathematician community highlights how these differences may reflect the distinct goals and professional activities of the two communities.

Findings generally supported the developmental progression, in that children reliably moved through the levels of thinking in that progression. For example, they passed through a level in which they measured length by placing multiple units or attempting to iterate a unit, sometimes leaving gaps between units.

The role that metacognitive skills play in math, however, seems to be subjected to change over the early years of secondary education. Metacognitive skills seem to become more general (i.e., less domain-specific) by nature (Veenman and Spaans in Learn Individ Differ 15:159-176, 2005). Moreover, according to the monotonic development hypothesis (Alexander et al. in Dev Rev 15:1-37, 1995), metacognitive skills increase with age, independent of intellectual development. This hypothesis was tested in a study with 29 second-year students (13-14 years) and 30 third-year students (14-15 years) in secondary education. A standardized intelligence test was administered to all students. Participants solved math word problems with a difficulty level adapted to their age group. Thinking-aloud protocols were collected and analyzed on the frequency and quality of metacognitive activities. Another series of math word problems served as post-test. Results show that the frequency of metacognitive activity, especially those of planning and evaluation, increased with age. Intelligence was a strong predictor of math performance in 13- to 14-year-olds, but it was less prominent in 14- to 15-year-olds. Although the quality of metacognitive skills appeared to predict math performance in both age groups, its predictive power was stronger in 14- to 15-yearolds, even on top of intelligence. It bears relevance to math education, as it shows the increasing relevance of metacognitive skills to math learning with age. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867569714

On the word problem test, children often overused proportional methods, but those in the CS-condition performed better than those in the SC-condition, suggesting a positive impact of the classification task.

The findings of teachers' practice and students' perception are juxtaposed to elicit characteristics of good teaching in Singapore grade 8 classrooms. With limitation, the findings of the paper suggests that good mathematics teaching in Singapore schools centres around building understanding and is teacher-centred but student focused. Some characteristic features of good lessons are that their instructional cycles have specific instructional objectives such that subsequent cycles incrementally build on the knowledge. The examples used in such lessons are carefully selected and vary in complexity from low to high. Teachers actively monitor their student's understanding during seatwork, by moving from desk to desk guiding those with difficulties and selecting appropriate student work for subsequent whole-class review and discussion. Finally, during such lessons teachers reinforce their students' understanding of knowledge expounded during whole-class demonstration by detailed review of student work done in class or as homework. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Grade 8; Mathematics; Singapore; Students' perception; Teachers' practice",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951603644

However, many administrators, teachers, parents, and policymakers appear not to recognize those complexities and their significance for practice. Fueling this perception, recommendations from isolated research findings often neglect the complexities in learning and teaching, and when implemented in classrooms often fall well short of the advertised effect. Consequently, education research is generally ignored, and the resulting research-practice gap raises concerns regarding the utility of university-based teacher education, and education research more generally. However, the strength of education research resides in the synergy resulting from its integration into a unifying system that guides, but does not determine, decision-making. Dewey (1929) argued for teacher decision-making guided by education research, but recently several writers have justly criticized education researchers for not providing comprehensible assistance to educators and policymakers (Good, 2007; Shymansky, 2006; Windschitl, 2005). This paper proposes a decision-making framework for teaching to help beginning and experienced teachers make sense of education research, come to understand crucial teacher decisions, and how those decisions interact to affect student learning. The proposed decision-making framework for teaching has significant utility in the design of science methods courses, science teacher education programs, effective student teacher supervision experiences, and professional development workshops. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2008.","Decision-making framework; Research synthesis; Teacher decision-making; Teacher development; Teacher education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349586074

Empirical studies with an ecological focus consistent with existing syllabi and focusing on cognitive achievement are scarce. Consequently, we concentrated on a classroom unit that offers learning materials and highlights the existing complexity rather than following linear conceptions. We developed an educational unit consisting of 14 individual lessons (""ecosystem lake"") with the aim of increasing pupils' cognitive achievement in 8th and 9th grade secondary schools. To evaluate our approach, we chose a quasi-experimental design and five teachers with ten classes participated in our study. A matched-pair tandem-design was provided by five German teachers using first his/her conventional approach in one class (instruction-1; control group) and second, our modern ecological approach in their second class (instruction-2). Pupils subjected to the latter performed better, i.e., achieved higher scores, especially in the delayed post-test. Further, we found a teacher effect and an interaction between treatment (i.e., whether treatment or control class) and the teacher regarding the class test. Teachers had a significant influence on the learning outcome irrespective of the educational unit, i.e., some teachers generally produced higher achievement than others. Further, the interaction showed that some teachers coped better with their traditional teaching. Nevertheless, in retention (delayed post-test) all classes of the modern approach scored higher than the traditionally taught ones. Boys and girls benefited equally from our program and pupils from the modern approach rated the educational unit better.

Collaboratively, the mathematician and two mathematics education researchers identified the challenges faced by the mathematician as he began to adopt reform-minded teaching practices. Our analysis reveals that responding to those challenges entailed formulating and addressing particular instructional goals, previously unfamiliar to the instructor. From a cognitive analytical perspective, we argue that the instructor's knowledge - or lack of knowledge - influenced his ability to set and accomplish his instructional goals as he planned for, reflected on, and enacted instruction. By studying the teaching practices of a professional mathematician, we identify forms of knowledge apart from mathematical content knowledge that are essential to reform-oriented teaching, and we highlight how knowledge acquired through more traditional instructional practices may fail to support research-based forms of student-centered teaching. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This research aimed to survey the Malaysian science/ mathematics teachers' perception towards this professional preparation effort. An instrument called ""Teachers Perception Towards the Professional Preparation to Teach Mathematics/Science in English"" was developed. The samples were 72 Form One mathematics/science teachers in Malaysia. The research revealed that the teachers perceived that their pre-service training (M = 2.90, SD = .57) and the in-service training (M = 2.99, SD = .62) is adequate in their professional preparation. However, the teachers perceived that there is a need (M = 3.18, SD = .82) for enhancing their professional readiness to teach mathematics/ science in English. Further analysis revealed that 44.3 % of the sample reported that their pre-service training could not develop their confidence in English speaking and after the in-service training 31.4% of the teachers still reported the same. About 84.7 % of the teachers also reported the need for training on helping students to learn in English. The findings showed that although the teachers perceived they are professionally prepared to teach mathematics/science in English, they still need more preparation in overcoming students' difficulties in learning the subjects in English especially for students who are weak in English or mathematics/science or both.

Teachers' global and specific SMSs respectively designate their conceptions and/or organization of their disciplines and of specific topics within those disciplines. Two preservice and two experienced secondary biology teachers were chosen to participate in the study. Participants were administered two open-ended questionnaires and were individually interviewed to assess their conceptions of biology and photosynthesis. The data were qualitatively analyzed through several rounds of category generation, confirmation, and modification. Teachers' global SMSs fell on a continuum from poorly articulated to well integrated and thematically organized. Contrary to global SMSs, specific SMSs separated the participants into their preservice and experienced groups. Unlike their preservice counterparts, the experienced teachers did not emphasize the details of photosynthesis and viewed the process as part of larger biological processes and systems. Analyses indicated that teaching experience and attention to student needs explained these latter differences.

A theoretical framework to guide research and implementation is briefly summarised. The scope of some current research being undertaken in mathematics and science classrooms in secondary schools in Mpumalanga, which includes surveys and case studies, is outlined. Part of this large-scale study is then presented in the analysis of eighteen video-taped science lessons from nine secondary schools in Mpumalanga that participated in the case studies. The findings are interpreted in terms of the metaphor of “out of the frying pan”, where the frying pan is symbolic of the old syllabus and way of doing things. For the most part, it was found that the specified outcomes of Curriculum 2005 are not being met. Finally some of the implications of the case studies, viewed through the lens of a theoretical framework for implementation of the streamlined version of Curriculum 2005, are explored. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16244385702

In order to assess the presence and the effects of these obstacles, three groups of subjects were investigated: students in grades 9 and 10 and prospective teachers. The results did not confirm these hypotheses. Many students are ignorant when asked to classify various numbers (rational, irrational, real) but only a small part of the subjects manifest genuine intuitive biases. It has been concluded that such erroneous intuitions (a common unit can always be found by indefinitely decreasing it and ""in an interval it is impossible to have two different infinite sets of points [or numbers]"") have not a primitive nature.

The sets were of varying sizes with different proportions of the two colours. The problem was to select the higher of the two probabilities. Three kinds of materials were used: Pairs of urns with blue and yellow beads, pairs of roulettes divided into blue and yellow sectors, and pairs of spinning tops, likewise divided into two colours. Roughly around the age of six, children started to select the greater of the two probabilities systematically. The dominant error was selecting the set with the greater number of POC elements. Verbal concepts of probability and chance were explored and some 'egocentric' thought processes were described. The study indicates that probability concepts could be introduced into school teaching even in the first grades.

Indeed they require increased design expertise because of the changing nature of the resources. Drawing on the literature (1) we suggest ten questions providing a tool to study teacher design processes; and (2) we propose three components for exploring teacher design capacity. Building on two main theoretical areas (i.e. teaching as design; documentational approach to didactics) we propose to deepen understandings of the notions of “teacher design” and “teacher design capacity”. Drawing on two different collective environments and two individual teacher cases working within these environments, we investigate and illustrate teachers’ design processes and design capacity building across a range of contexts and curriculum formations, with the focus on how digital resources can help to develop teacher design capacity. We claim that the evolutions of digital resources in particular require an elaboration and refinement of the concept of teacher design capacity, which we develop and illustrate.

Assuming reasoning to be central to proving and aiming to develop knowledge about how teacher actions may promote students’ mathematical reasoning, we conduct design research where whole-class mathematical discussions triggered by exploratory tasks play a key role. We take mathematical reasoning as making justified inferences and we consider generalizing and justifying central reasoning processes. Regarding teacher actions, we consider inviting, informing/suggesting, supporting/guiding and challenging actions can be identified in whole-class discussions. This paper presents design principles for an intervention geared to tackle such reasoning processes and focuses on a whole-class discussion on a grade 7 lesson about linear equations and functions. Data analysis concerns teacher actions in relation to design principles and to the sought mathematical reasoning processes. The conclusions highlight teacher actions that lead students to generalize and justify. Generalizations may arise from a central challenging action or from several guiding actions. Regarding justifications, a main challenging action seems to be essential, while follow-up guiding actions may promote a further development of this reasoning process. Thus, this paper provides a set of design principles and a characterization of teacher actions which enhance students’ mathematical reasoning processes such as generalization and justification. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Design research; Generalization; Justification; Mathematical reasoning; Teacher actions",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022028226

Understanding the contextual and psychological antecedents of students’ worry thus represents an important area of research. Drawing on Eccles and colleagues’ expectancy-value theory and Pekrun’s control-value theory and using data from the Childhood and Beyond Study, we examined the motivational underpinnings of elementary students’ worries about performing poorly in the domains of mathematics and reading (N = 805, grades 3, 4 and 6). With one exception, the analyses confirmed that children’s expectations of success in and valuing of mathematics and reading interacted in predicting children’s worry about these domains. Children’s worry was strongest when they rated their subjective abilities and expected success in mathematics and reading as relatively low but perceived these subjects as valuable. Moderated mediation analyses further suggested that when children’s self-concepts of mathematics and reading ability were low to moderate, students’ perceived parental valuing of their performance in these subjects indirectly positively predicted children’s worry via its positive impact on children’s own subjective valuing of mathematics and reading. Thus, when children perceive high academic performance as potentially difficult to attain, perceived parental valuing might negatively impact their wellbeing in school (by increasing not only their valuing of mathematics and reading, but also their performance-related worrying). Children’s gender, grade level, teacher-rated mathematics and reading aptitude, and prior self-reported worry about mathematics and reading performance were included as control variables in all analyses. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019366230

An open-source, location-based game platform called ARIS (i.e. Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling) was used to create an iPad-based mobile game. The game used QR scan codes and a challenge-based game structure to encourage engagement in science. Participants wore head-mounted GoPro cameras to record interactions within the physical and social environment. The purpose of this research was to study the impact of a mobile game on student interactions in a science center. Gender differences in gameplay behaviors and perceptions were compared. The study included a quasi-experimental design with two groups: one group that played the iPad mobile game during their science center visit, and one group that explored the science center in a traditional free exploration manner. Video data from the GoPro cameras provided examination of the different ways students interacted with the science center. The female students outperformed the male students on every measure of the iPad game achievement. Lazzaro’s (2004) four types of fun was used to describe the gender differences in game perceptions and interactions. Females tended to enjoy hard fun and collaborative people fun, while males enjoyed easy fun and competitive people fun. The females tended to be more goal-oriented, persistent in the face of difficulty, and appreciative of hard fun.

In the research literature, this role has been widely theorised from a Vygotskian perspective. This perspective is limited by some of its underlying assumptions, including an instrumental and systemic view of language as tool and its basis in dialectic. In this paper, I propose a Bakhtinian, dialogic perspective as an alternative. I focus my discussion on the long-standing issue of the relationship between formal and informal mathematical language in the learning and teaching of mathematics. I illustrate this discussion with an examination of interaction in an elementary school mathematics classroom in Québec, Canada. Based on Bakhtin’s ideas, I argue that mathematical meaning emerges through locally produced, situated dialogic relations between multiple discourses, voices and languages in mathematics classroom interaction. From this perspective, students do not follow a linear path from informal to formal mathematical discourse; rather, they work with the teacher to expand the repertoire of possible ways to make meaning in mathematics. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bakhtin; Dialectic; Dialogue; Mathematical discourse; Mathematical language; Vygotsky",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944521547

We begin by contrasting dialogic theory to other leading theoretical approaches to understanding conceptual development in mathematics influenced by Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. We argue that both Piagetian and Vygotskian traditions in mathematics education overlook important dialogic causal processes enabling or hindering switches in perspective between voices in relationship. To illustrate this argument, we use Piagetian-, Vygotskian- and Bakhtinian-inspired approaches to analyse a short extract of classroom data in which two 12-year-old boys using TinkerPlots software change their understanding of a probability problem. While all three analyses have something useful to offer, our dialogic analysis reveals aspects of the episode, in particular the significance of the emotional engagement and the laughter of the students, which are occluded by the other two approaches. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bakhtin; Conceptual development; Dialogic; Piaget; Theory; Vygotsky",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941748073

The issue, therefore, is what teaching practices such so-called 'mid-adopting' mathematics teachers develop in their teaching with digital resources, and what skills and knowledge they need for this. To address this question, a theoretical framework including notions of instrumental orchestration and the TPACK model for teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge underpins the setting-up of a project with twelve mathematics teachers, novice in the field of integrating technology in teaching. Technology-rich teaching resources are provided, as well as support through face-to-face group meetings and virtual communication. Data include lesson observations and questionnaires. The results include a taxonomy of orchestrations, an inventory of skills and knowledge needed, and an overview of the relationships between them. During the project, teachers do change their orchestrations and acquire skills.

As the study progressed, the students formed more robust understandings of degree and radian measures by constructing an arc length image of angle measures; the students' quantification of angle measure entailed measuring arcs and conceiving multiplicative relationships between a subtended arc, a circle's circumference, and a circle's radius. The students leveraged these quantitative relationships to transition between units with a fixed magnitude (e. g., an arc length's measure in feet) and various angle measure units, while maintaining invariant meanings for angle measures in different units. These results suggest that quantifying angle measure, regardless of unit, through processes that involve measuring arc lengths can support coherent angle measure understandings. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Angle measure; Multiplicative reasoning; Quantitative reasoning; Student thinking; Teaching experiment; Trigonometry",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876922926

The paper offers a case study of the teaching of a traditionally-taught abstract algebra course, including showing the range of practice as larger than previously described in research literature. This study describes the aspects of proof writing and modes of thought the instructor modeled for the students. The study finds that she frequently modeled the aspects of hierarchical structure and formal-rhetorical skills, and structural, critical, and instantiation modes of thought. This study also examines the instructor's attempts to involve the students in the proof writing process during class by asking questions and expecting responses. Finally, the study describes how those questions and responses were part of her proof presentation. The funneling pattern of Steinbring (1989) describes most of the question and answer discussions enacted in the class with most questions requiring a factual response. Yet, the instructional sequence can be also understood as modeling the way an expert in the discipline thinks and, as such, offering a different type of opportunity for student learning. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abstract algebra; Proof presentation; Teacher questions; Undergraduate teaching",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867100077

Five teachers who had implemented challenging mathematics curriculum materials for three or more years were videotaped enacting instructional sequences and were subsequently interviewed about those enactments. The results indicate that the two teachers who attended closely to student thinking developed conjectures about how that thinking developed across instructional sequences and used those conjectures to inform their adaptations. These teachers connected their conjectures to the details of student strategies, leading to adaptations that enhanced task complexity and students' opportunity to engage with mathematical concepts. By contrast, the three teachers who evaluated students' thinking primarily as right or wrong regularly adapted tasks in ways that were poorly informed by their observations and that reduced the complexity of the tasks.

This study examines student and school background characteristics associated with low and high achievement in mathematics and science on the Programme for International Student Assessment. Based on the results of a multilevel multinomial model of achievement for each domain, findings indicate that a greater number of the variables examined are associated with low rather than high achievement. At student level, home language, intention to leave school early, socioeconomic status, grade level, cultural capital, and books in the home are significantly associated with achievement in mathematics and science. At school level, only school average socioeconomic status is statistically significant in the models. Significant gender differences are found in the distribution of high and low achievers, which vary across the domains. In mathematics, females are more likely to be low achievers while males are more likely to be high achievers. In science, gender interacts with early school-leaving intent whereas males intending to leave school early are more likely to be in the low-achieving group than females intending to leave early. Conclusions emphasise the need for targeting resources aimed at promoting equity in outcomes at student level as well as at school level.

Students are often taught procedurally how to find a basis for a subspace using matrix manipulation, but may struggle with understanding the construct of basis, making further progress harder. We believe one reason for this is because students have major difficulties with concepts of span and linear independence which form the requirements for a set of vectors to form a basis. In this research we applied a theoretical framework based on Tall's three worlds of mathematics learning and action-process-object-schema (APOS) theory to the learning of the concept of basis by a group of second year university students. The results suggest that an emphasis on matrix processes may not help students understand the concept, and embodied, visual ideas that could be valuable were usually lacking. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","APOS; Embodied; Linear algebra; Mathematics education; Object; Process; Representation; Three worlds; University",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951269210

Such problems draw upon other disciplines for their contexts and data. The article initially considers the nature of modelling with complex systems and discusses how such experiences differ from existing problem-solving activities in the primary mathematics curriculum. Principles for designing interdisciplinary modelling problems are then addressed, with reference to two mathematical modelling problems- one based in the scientific domain and the other in the literary domain. Examples of the models children have created in solving these problems follow. A reflection on the differences in the diversity and sophistication of these models raises issues regarding the design of interdisciplinary modelling problems.

TIMSS, especially, has demonstrated the central role that the concept of opportunity to learn plays in understanding cross-national differences in achievement Schmidt et al., (Why schools matter: A cross-national comparison of curriculum and learning 2001). The curricular expectations of a nation and the actual content exposure that is delivered to students by teachers were found to be among the most salient features of schooling related to academic performance. The other feature that emerges in these studies is the importance of the teacher. The professional competence of the teacher which includes substantive knowledge regarding formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy is suggested as being significant-not just in understanding cross-national differences but also in other studies as well (Hill et al. in Am Educ Res J 42(2):371-406, 2005). Mathematics Teaching in the 21st Century (MT21) is a small, six-country study that collected data on future lower secondary teachers in their last year of preparation. One of the findings noted in the first report of that study was that the opportunities future teachers experienced as part of their formal education varied across the six countries (Schmidt et al. in The preparation gap: Teacher education for middle school mathematics in six countries, 2007). This variation in opportunity to learn (OTL) existed in course work related to formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy. It appears from these initial results that OTL not only is important in understanding K-12 student learning but it is also likely important in understanding the knowledge base of the teachers who teach them which then has the potential to influence student learning as well. This study using the same MT21 data examines in greater detail the configuration of the educational opportunities future teachers had during their teacher education in some 34 institutions across the six countries. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.","Comparative study of teacher education; Mathematics teacher education; Opportunities to learn; Teacher education curriculum; Teacher preparation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867372688

A total of 1,212 students in Taiwan participated in this study. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, the students perform best on ""recognizing relative number size"" and perform worst on ""judging the reasonableness of estimates of computed results"". This finding is consistent with previous studies. It shows that students in Taiwan seem quite poor on judging the reasonableness of estimates of computed results. Second, female students, on average, have higher scores on recognizing the relative number size than male students, even though only a small effect size is found. And, third, the achievements of the students in mathematics are significantly correlated with their number sense, as measured by the average grade for the academic year of 5th-grade students. © 2007 National Science Council, Taiwan.","5th graders; Computerized; Mathematics achievement; Number sense; Scale",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849145906

During each interview, a multimedia version of the case study, including video of the original episode, was available to the participants. We identify two modes of discourse engaged in by the teachers during the interviews: Grounded Narrative and Evaluative Discourse. We examine and identify the characteristics of the two discourse forms, drawn from both video and textual analysis. These characteristics are self-reflective talk, perspective, ethics, and linguistic patterns.

It presents an analysis of a dialogue held with Kasia, a sixteen-years-old pupil of a general academic secondary school. The conversation concentrates on a non-standard problem - a functional equation. The theoretical framework used here is the PROCEPT THEORY formulated by Gray and Tall (1993, 1994). The article diagnoses Kasia's procept of function revealed during the dialogue. Her difficulties with understanding this notion can be described as based on a very limited procept of function and a misinterpretation of the symbols used in the functional equation. Three kinds of sources of the difficulties are identified: firstly, the intrinsic ambiguities in the mathematical notation, secondly, the restricted context in which some symbols occur in teaching and a limited choice of mathematical tasks at school, and, thirdly, Kasia's idiosyncratic interpretation of mathematical tasks. Moreover, the paper describes several important changes in understanding of symbols and of the concept of function that took place in the course of the dialogue. This article shows that we can use functional equations as both a research and a didactic tool in mathematics education.","Case study; Difficulties; Function; Functional equation; Procept; Sources; Symbolism; Understanding",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843119948

Further, we see whalewatching (and, by implication, other forms of nature experience) as a significant adjunct to formal science education because it creates space for the strong affective component essential to effecting the transition from caring about to caring for the environment, and because it can be a site for a more explicitly politicized type of science education than is generally possible in today’s increasingly corporatized school system. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011501236

Preliminary consideration of these errors and the strategies which appear to have given rise to them suggests that the use of informal 'naive' methods which are limited in their applicability is widespread even at fourth-year level. The suggestion is made that there may be two 'systems' of mathematics coexisting in the secondary school classroom: the formal taught system, and a system of child-methods which are based upon a 'counting', 'adding-on' or 'building-up' approach, and by which children attempt to solve mathematical problems within a 'human-sense' framework. The difficulties which some children appear to experience in mathematics is suggested to be due in part to these children's non-initiation into the formal taught system.

Certainly, when both females and males study the same amount of mathematics, differences in learning mathematics are minimal and perhaps decreasing. Many fewer females elect to study mathematics and therein lies the problem. Variables which appear to contribute to this non-election are females' lesser confidence in their ability to learn mathematics and their belief that mathematics is not useful to them. In addition, differential teacher treatment of males and females is important. All variables appear to be directly related to the stereotyping of mathematics as a male domain. There is nothing inherent (Sherman [30]) which keeps females from learning mathematics at the same level as do males. Intervention programs can and must be designed and implemented within schools which will increase females' participation in mathematics. Such programs should include male students, female students and their teachers. Only when such intervention programs become effective can true equity in mathematics education be accomplished. © 1979 D.

My concern here was to offer you some data which, I hoped would contrast in various ways with the data you would normally meet. But how successful have I been? Leaving aside those readers who work in Papua New Guinea or similar cultures, consider how different this data is. Even in technologically developed societies and cultures do we not find some of these problems - sometimes with adults, certainly with children? Could I give as a general description of those people ""those who have not yet been inducted into the mathematician's culture"" or sometimes even ""those who have chosen not to enter it""? Perhaps if we consider mathematics education as a form of cultural induction we would realise both the enormity of the task and the range of influences that can be brought to bear. We would for example not only consider problems like ""What are the skills necessary to be a successful mathematician?"" but also others like ""What is the value of entering the mathematician's world?"" and ""Why do we consider it to be so important?"" If we do consider mathematics to be problem-solving par excellence, then we should also recall that it is only one approach to problem-solving and it can be seen by 'outsiders' as a very strange business. (As another example, ask yourself why you spend a long time looking for a quick solution). Even if we feel we know what the values of learning mathematics are we then face problems such as how do we transmit those values? What do we know about the role of the teacher as a cultural transmitter, as an example, as a model for imitation? And there are many other questions. Mathematics education has powerful cultural and social components. Perhaps we should give them the attention which we have already given to the psychological components. © 1979 D.

However, despite the large body of research on this topic, there has been little consensus on how educators best support the development of CT. In view of some of the controversies surrounding the teaching of CT skills in higher education, this study examined the effects of embedding CT instruction systematically in domain-specific courses (Immersion vs. Infusion) on the acquisition of domain-specific and domain-general CT skills and course achievement. First-year university students (N = 143) enrolled in an introductory physics course were assigned to one of three instructional conditions: Immersion, Infusion, and control. The Immersion and Infusion conditions followed lessons designed systematically based on the First Principles of Instruction model, whereas the control condition followed a regular instruction. Results showed that participants in the Immersion and Infusion conditions significantly outperformed those in the control condition on domain-specific CT proficiency and course achievement. However, neither the Immersion nor the Infusion condition was helpful in fostering the acquisition of domain-general CT skills. The findings generally demonstrated that embedding CT instruction systematically in domain-specific courses requires greater clarity about what set of CT skills could be targeted in domain-specific instruction, how specific subject-matter instruction could be designed considering CT as an integral part of domain-specific instruction, and how best CT outcomes be assessed. Some considerations for the design of CT-supportive learning environments are discussed. © 2017, The Author(s).","Domain-general critical thinking; Domain-specific critical thinking; Instructional design; Intervention; Physics",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025070130

However, not much attention has been paid to empirical investigations of its scholarly knowledge from the perspective of didactic transposition processes. This paper reports from an interview study of mathematical modelling activities involving nine professional model constructors. The research question was: How can mathematical modelling by professional mathematical model constructors be characterised? The analysis of our interview data inspired by the coding procedure of grounded theory led us to the description of three main types of modelling activities as a characterisation of mathematical modelling as a professional task. In data-generated modelling the models are developed principally from quantitative data drawing on no or only some assumed knowledge of the system being modelled, while in theory-generated modelling the models are developed based on established theory. In the third activity, model-generated modelling, the development of new models is based on already established models. For all types, the use of computer support and communication between clients, constructors and other experts are central aspects. Finally, the three types of modelling activities are related to existing theoretical descriptions of mathematical modelling and the relevance of the study for mathematical modelling in education is discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Computer support; Didactic transposition; Mathematical modelling; Workplace mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949097050

Using key features of scaffolding (diagnosis, responsiveness, handover to independence) we analysed strategies the teacher used to establish the required norms and practices. Interviewed reflections from the teacher provided further insights into her intentions and adaptive responses to students’ emerging practices. The analysis showed how the teacher constantly diagnosed the classroom norms and responsively used strategies that changed as norms emerged, developed and stabilised. After nine months, there was evidence of argumentation-based inquiry norms practiced by students, independent of the teacher’s presence. © 2015, The Author(s).","Argumentation-based inquiry (ABI); Classroom culture; Classroom talk; Inquiry norms; Inquiry practices; Mathematical inquiry; Scaffolding",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947436847

Previous studies have shown that certain conceptualizations, such as the area under a curve or the values of an anti-derivative, may be less productive in making sense of contextualized integrals. On the other hand, interpreting the integral using Riemann sum-based conceptions proves much more productive for understanding contextualized integrals. This study investigates how frequently students from a US calculus population drew on these three conceptualizations (as well as others) to interpret the meaning of definite integrals. The results were achieved by asking a large sample of students from two US colleges (n = 150) four open-ended questions regarding the underlying meaning of definite integrals. Data from the student responses show a high prevalence of area and anti-derivative ideas and a relatively low occurrence of multiplicatively based summation ideas for interpreting these integrals. Possible reasons for and implications of the results are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","anti-derivative; area; calculus; definite integral; Riemann sum",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929711496

The development and refinement of the MKT construct, including the components of common content knowledge (CCK) and specialized content knowledge (SCK), came from research into elementary teachers’ practices. In this article, we argue that various issues arise as these constructs are used in research on secondary and post-secondary teachers. For example, elementary teachers typically differ from teachers of higher grades in their content preparation. What then is the relationship of CCK to SCK for those holding a bachelors degree or higher in mathematics? The MKT construct is based on CCK being knowledge held or used by an average mathematically literate citizen and that SCK is different. However, among those teaching in secondary and post-secondary contexts, what should be considered CCK? Is conceptual understanding of the CCK among those with bachelor’s degrees or higher level mathematics the same as SCK? We examine these questions as well as others that arose from our examination of definitions of CCK and SCK as we attempted to utilize those definitions to characterize the nature of MKT at secondary and undergraduate levels. We illustrate these issues with data from two instructional settings. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Mathematical knowledge for teaching; Post-secondary teachers; Secondary teachers; Teacher knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939872997

Research questions were (1) whether we have to deal with a “reality shock” in that beginning teachers’ beliefs change to more traditional ones or whether their knowledge decreases, (2) whether the school context in terms of appraisal and a climate of trust influences the knowledge and belief development, and (3) to what extent the beginning teachers’ knowledge and beliefs predict their perception, interpretation, and decision-making skills. Data from 231 German primary teachers in their third year in the profession neither revealed changes of beliefs towards traditional ones nor a substantial loss in knowledge. In contrast, general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) grew significantly and beliefs on the nature of mathematics were more dynamic 3 years after teacher education. Thus, drawbacks are a rare phenomenon in our sample.

As a complement to the approach through the analysis of teachers' beliefs and practices (see Engeln et al. in ZDM Int J Math Educ 45(6), this issue, 2013), we tackle this issue from a systemic institutional perspective. Indeed, in our approach, we consider teachers as actors of institutions, representing some disciplines, embedded in a school system, sharing some common pedagogical issues, in relation to society. Our sources of information are easily accessible public documents. With a theoretical background from Chevallard's anthropological theory of didactics, we organized our analysis according to four levels of institutional organization that co-determine both content and didactical aspects in the teaching of mathematics and sciences: society, school, pedagogy and disciplinary. Our approach is systemic in the sense that we do not focus on teachers as individuals, nor on the curricula, the organization of teachers' training or the textbooks themselves. Rather, we trace the way the conditions and constraints are operative, provide the main results of our analysis and draw out a few perspectives according to our four levels of didactical determination.

This study explores the discourse on limits in a beginning-level undergraduate calculus classroom by focusing on one instructor's and his students' discourses through a communicational approach to cognition. The findings indicate that some of the limit-related contexts in which students struggled coincided with those in which the instructor shifted his elements of discourse on limits. The instructor did not attend to the shifts in his discourse, making them implicit for the students. The study highlights that the discrepancies among participants' discourses signal communicational breakages and suggests that future studies should examine whether teachers' explicit attention to the elements of their discourse can enhance communication in the classrooms. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Commognitive framework; Limits; Student discourse; Teacher discourse",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873521912

Using video, field notes, and an interview, this research examines a case study of one urban classroom of Latino and African American students. Their teacher engages them in substantive mathematics and reform-minded pedagogical strategies, but a number of relational interactions raise issues of how these micro-interactions can mediate access to mathematics. The study found four dimensions in which relational interactions mediated access to mathematics: addressing behavior, framing mathematics ability, acknowledging student contributions, and attending to culture and language.

These tensions can be ultimately traced to the contradictions in the way mathematical knowledge enhances the use value and exchange value of labour power, respectively. To understand this as a social psychological phenomenon, I look to two well-known theoretical perspectives on education, first that of the Marxist psychology of Vygotsky and activity theory (and contemporary cultural-historical activity theory) which I find tends to marginalise 'exchange value'. Second, I look to Bourdieu's sociology of education that tends to marginalise the use value. I then bring together these two perspectives in a joint theory of education as both development and re-production of labour power, in which use and exchange value both have their place (in commodity production).

This was a shift away from the learning of more-or-less isolated facts and facets in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics towards a restructuring of science teaching along the general principles of the respective science domains. The changes included also the addition of dimensions such as problem-based learning, understanding the basics of the Nature of Science, and engaging students in the methods of science. Since then, practical work has been solidly built into German science syllabi for each one of the separate teaching domains in school science. However, research evidence shows that practical work is still limited in many science classrooms. In many cases, hands-on work is only present as either teacher demonstrations or as cookbook-style recipe experiments for pupils. The shortcomings of such practice have also become evident in the TIMSS and PISA studies conducted since 1997. However, the outcomes published by PISA 2000 also initiated further change in Germany. For the first time ever, national science education standards were introduced for lower secondary science education. In 2004, these standards sharpened the focus of learning more prominently on how to practically carry out science tasks. The resulting reform led to research and development activity in different fields of innovation, among them science education practical work. This paper gives an account of the development of practical science work in German schools and it discusses the most prominent trends in practical science efforts in German secondary science education which have taken place in recent years. © 2012 by ESER.","Curriculum; German secondary science education; Practical work; Standards; Syllabi",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862699294

In interviews conducted with eight undergraduates, we found students' initial descriptions of subspace often varied substantially from the language of the concept's formal definition, which is very algebraic in nature. This is consistent with literature in other mathematical content domains that indicates that a learner's primary understanding of a concept is not necessarily informed by that concept's formal definition. We used the analytical tools of concept image and concept definition of Tall and Vinner (Educational Studies in Mathematics, 12(2):151-169, 1981) in order to highlight this distinction in student responses. Through grounded analysis, we identified recurring concept imagery that students provided for subspace, namely, geometric object, part of whole, and algebraic object. We also present results regarding the coordination between students' concept image and how they interpret the formal definition, situations in which students recognized a need for the formal definition, and qualities of subspace that students noted were consequences of the formal definition. Furthermore, we found that all students interviewed expressed, to some extent, the technically inaccurate ""nested subspace"" conception that Rk is a subspace of Rn for k &lt; n. We conclude with a discussion of this and how it may be leveraged to inform teaching in a productive, student-centered manner. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Concept image and concept definition; Linear algebra; Subspace; Undergraduate mathematics education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79751531680

Learning proofs and counterexamples within the domain of continuous functions is important because students encounter continuous functions in many mathematics courses. Recently, a growing number of studies have provided evidence that students have difficulty with mathematical proofs. Few of these research studies, however, have focused on undergraduates' abilities to produce proofs and counterexamples in the domain of continuous functions. The goal of this study is to contribute to research on student productions of proofs and counterexamples and to identify their abilities and mathematical understandings. The findings suggest more attention should be paid to teaching and learning proofs and counterexamples, as participants showed difficulty in writing these statements. More importantly, the analysis provides insight into the design of curriculum and instruction that may improve undergraduates' learning in advanced mathematics courses.","Continuous functions; Counterexample; Proof",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349165064

A retrospective analysis using constant comparison methodology was then undertaken during which the classroom video, related student interviews, and teacher interviews were revisited many times in order to generate a thematic analysis. Our results indicate that the identification and coordination of the units involved in the problem situation are critical aspects of quantitative reasoning and need to be emphasized in the teaching-learning process.

Responses were analysed starting from a previously-developed phenomenographic framework (Reid et al., 2003) which required only minor modification. Students' conceptions of mathematics ranged from the narrowest view as a focus on calculations with numbers, through a notion of mathematics as a focus on models or abstract structures, to the broadest view of mathematics as an approach to life and a way of thinking. Broader conceptions of mathematics were more likely to be found in later-year students (p<0.001) and there were significant differences between universities (p<0.001).

For the responses using conventional strategies, both the U.S. and Chinese teachers gave them high and almost identical scores. If a response involved a drawing or an estimate of an answer, the Chinese teachers usually gave a relatively lower score than U.S. teachers. This study contributes to our understanding about U.S. and Chinese teachers' beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2005.","Classroom instruction; Cross-national perspective; Mathematical problem solving; Pedagogical representation; Ratio concept; Solution representation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745596114

Thus, there are no models that situate interview responses to graphing tasks. How, then, we question, are the interview texts produced How do respondents begin and end utterances And, what is the relation between words and gestures used as part of the communication Based on a database developed in two studies with research scientists (N = 37), we developed a theoretical framework using cultural-historical activity theory for understanding the texts produced during interviews. Our framework addresses three major findings, whose implications are discussed in the paper. First, the interview text is the contingent and situated product of the entire activity system, including interviewer and other aspects of the setting; the interview text can therefore not be reduced to the cognitive properties of the individual interviewee. Second, the interpretation unfolds in time, shaping the way the graph itself is perceived; unlike a written text that accompanies a graph, the verbally produced interview text therefore has to be analyzed through a moving interpretive window without recourse to subsequently produced talk. Third, gestures, speech, and the perceptual aspects of the graph currently salient to the interviewee, have to be understood as expressions that are irreducible to one another, requiring comprehensive research reports to present all modes of concurrent expression.","cultural-historical activity theory; graphs; inner contradictions; interpretation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044248284

While the need for students to use and reason on multiple representations is widely accepted, the research-based knowledge on how to best accomplish this goal is just beginning to emerge. Current cognitive theories indicate that students’ knowledge of and preference for various representations is crucial to the decision process. This project develops and validates an instrument for determining student preferences for multiple representations of functions and establishes base-line data for future research. The results indicate that students do have preferences for representations of functions and that these preferences vary between contextualized and non-contextualized settings. Furthermore, students’ preferences between these two settings are more similar for students in a graphics calculator-based calculus course than for students in a traditional calculus course. If a student has a cognitive preference for a representation, it is likely that the strongest connections between representations and between concept and representation are constructed to and from the student's preferred representation. Thus, attempts to situate the development of mathematics in context and attempts to enable students to approach mathematics as a sense-making activity may do well to build from students’ preferences for representations. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18844389684

This course was designed to address discrepancies between how students learn and how they were traditionally being taught. Based on results from the first implementation, pedagogical changes were made, including increased computer programming activities and other exercises which were designed to give the students the opportunity to build experience to draw on in order to construct understanding of the topics in class. A second experimental course was run. To assess the impact of these methods, and to continue to better understand how students go about learning, test results from the latter class and interviews with students from both experimental courses and a lecture-based class were analyzed. The students in the second experimental course demonstrated a deep understanding of the title concepts, especially cosets and normality. We discuss the details of the revised experimental course; the epistemological theory behind its design; and the framework used to analyze the results.

However, as these dimensions are mainly regarded as generic, subject-specific aspects of mathematics instruction, e.g., the mathematical depth of argumentation or the adequacy of concept introductions, are not covered in depth. Therefore, a new instrument for the analysis of instructional quality was developed, which extended this three-dimensional framework by relevant subject-specific aspects of instructional quality. In this paper, the newly developed observational protocol is applied to three videotaped mathematics lessons from the NCTE video library of Harvard University to explore strengths and weaknesses of this instrument, and to examine in more detail how the instrument works in practice.

Study 1 involved a historical analysis of the problem-posing (PP) tasks in 3 editions of the most widely used elementary mathematics textbook series published by People’s Education Press in China over 3 decades. Study 2 compared the PP tasks in Chinese and US elementary mathematics textbooks. This allows for the examination of PP tasks from an international comparative perspective, which provides one point of view about the kinds of learning opportunities that are available to students in China and the USA. We found evidence that the inclusion of PP tasks in the Chinese textbook series reflected, to some degree, changes in the curricular frameworks in China. However, the distribution of PP tasks across grade levels and content areas, as well as the variety of types of PP tasks included, suggest a need for greater intentionality in the design and placement of PP tasks in both the Chinese and US textbook series. Findings from the 2 studies reported in this paper not only contribute to our understanding about the inclusion of PP tasks in curriculum both historically and internationally, but also suggest a great need to systematically integrate PP activities into curriculum and instruction. The fact that both Chinese and US curriculum standards have heavily emphasized PP in school mathematics, despite there being only a small proportion of PP activities in both Chinese and US elementary mathematics curricula, suggests the existence of challenges that are delaying the implementation of reform ideas such as problem posing in school mathematics. © 2016, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","China; Mathematics curriculum; Mathematics education reform; Problem posing; Textbook analysis; United States",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980048078

A path analysis showed that strategic knowledge about drawing was positively related to students’ modelling performance. This relation was mediated by the type and accuracy of the drawings that were generated. The accuracy of situational drawing was related only indirectly to performance.

The aim of this paper is to improve joint training activities as the basis for future studies of masters that will be implemented in an open information and education space. The key approach to the study of the problems of the joint educational researches relies on the conceptual ideas of experiments conducting in joint environment in which access to individual and shared data in an open information education environment is restricted. Theoretical and technological tools were developed for working with factorial data of collaborative research in open educational environment. As a result these conceptual ideas were formulated for joint training of master's studies: the stages to improve joint research activities were grounded, the technology of forming joint bank of comparable research materials was created, the system of algorithms for collaborative (joint) working with experimental data was proposed, the strategy ensuring the adequacy of the joint pilot materials for attaining general and private purposes was worked out. This strategy also should be applied to the value and usefulness of collected data. The collected, studied, processed and presented in the paper unique experimental material can be useful both for solving current individual research tasks of undergraduates and for the development of new roles in research. © Authors.","cooperative research projects; Masters' programs; open educational informational environment",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021447010

This showed that the young adults who had experienced the 2 mathematics teaching approaches developed profoundly different relationships with mathematics knowledge that contributed towards the shaping of different identities as learners and users of mathematics (Boaler & Greeno, 2000). The adults from the project-based school had also moved into significantly more professional jobs, despite living in one of the lowest income areas of the country.

Studies on this matter view the self-regulated learning ability as key to improving problem-solving skills. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between mathematical problem-solving skills and the three dimensions of self-regulated learning (motivation, metacognition, and behaviour), and whether this relationship is of a predictive nature. The sample of this study consists of 323 students from two public secondary schools in Istanbul. In this study, the mathematics homework behaviour scale was administered to measure students’ homework behaviours. For metacognition measurements, the mathematics metacognition skills test for students was administered to measure offline mathematical metacognitive skills, and the metacognitive experience scale was used to measure the online mathematical metacognitive experience. The internal and external motivational scales used in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test were administered to measure motivation. A hierarchic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables in the study. Based on the findings, a model was formed in which 24% of the total variance in students’ mathematical problem-solving skills is explained by the three sub-dimensions of the self-regulated learning model: internal motivation (13%), willingness to do homework (7%), and post-problem retrospective metacognitive experience (4%). © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","homework behaviour; metacognition; motivation; problem solving; self-regulated learning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959251080

And lastly, how can scaffolding manage the tension between providing appropriate calibrated support while also providing opportunities beyond learners’ current understandings? The paper describes how attention to mathematical practices can maintain a sociocultural theoretical framing for scaffolding and move scaffolding beyond procedural fluency. The paper first specifies the sociocultural theoretical assumptions framing the concept of scaffolding, with particular attention to mathematical practices. The paper provides three examples of scaffolding mathematical practices in two settings, individual and whole-class.

Second, we focus on different CPD frameworks to showcase developments in CPD research and practice over the last 40 years and the influences of different views of CDP. Third, we elaborate what developing CPD in an evidence-based way means, before we finally discuss crucial issues of spreading CPD on a large scale. In this last perspective, we draw on Coburn’s four dimensions characterizing the process of scaling CPD interventions, depth, sustainability, spread, and shift in reform ownership to discuss how the challenge of scaling high-quality CPD might be successfully addressed. Our literature review is based on findings from education research in general and mathematics education research in particular in order to pay attention to both overarching aspects of providing effective CPD and the domain-specific factors of mathematics teaching and learning.

The results highlighted the fact that even if one of big ideas is ignored, the concept of derivative may not be fully understood relationally due to the compartmentalization of these big ideas in students' conceptual systems.

This analysis of six secondary-level geometry textbooks, like studies of other textbooks, characterizes the justifications given in the exposition and the reasoning-and-proving activities expected of students in the exercises. Furthermore, this study considers whether the mathematical statements included in the reasoning-and-proving opportunities are general or particular in nature. Findings include the fact that the majority of expository mathematical statements were general, whereas reasoning-and-proving exercises tended to involve particular mathematical statements.

Using a theoretical framework based on teacher documentation work, we focused on interactions between teachers and resources to study two teachers' work: one teacher in France and one teacher in Norway. For both teachers we identified collective dimensions in their work with resources. Contrasting these two cases enabled us to identify particular features, but also possible invariants, of teachers' work with resources. Our results indicate that collective dimensions are always present in teachers' work, but that true communities of practice, which could be considered as an achievement of collective teachers' work, are scarce.

To facilitate effective student preparation and improve their learning outcomes, we have designed and developed an online resource centre. These resources are used by students in conjunction with traditional resources including the laboratory manual prior to attendance in laboratories. Resources comprise a series of web based activities including visual and audio presentations, pre-laboratory questions and quizzes related to the laboratory activities that the students will complete. To determine how effective these resources were in facilitating laboratory preparation, students were surveyed both before and after the introduction of the resources. Surveys were designed to establish student perceptions regarding their preparatory practices. In addition, the effect on some measurable learning outcomes was established. This paper reports on how the implementation of this blended learning approach has improved the nature of student preparation practices. Presenting information in a flexible learning format, prior to participation, enhanced student familiarisation with theoretical and experimental procedures. Thus facilitated preparation reduced the potential risk of cognitive dissonance by improving student organisational abilities which in turn lead to better experimental learning outcomes and value-added student perception of the laboratory experience as a whole.","Blended learning; Cognitive overload; Pre-laboratory preparation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865544956

The experiment comprised 20 lessons with 73 word problems, providing a systematic overview of the basic word problem types. Teachers of the experimental classes received a booklet containing lesson plans and overhead transparencies with different types of visual representations attached to the word problems. Students themselves were invited to make drawings for each task, and group work and teacher-led discussion shaped their beliefs about the role of visual representations in word problem solving. The effect sizes of the experiment were calculated from the results of two tests: an arithmetic skill and a word problem test, and the unbiased estimates for Cohen's d proved to be 0. 20 and 0. 62.

We report on a case study in which one dyad participating in a pre-service teachers program solved a mathematical task.

We show how the design afforded productive argumentation. We show that the design of the task entailed argumentation which first relied on intuition, then intertwined the activities of conjecturing and checking conjectures by means of various hypotheses-testing devices (measurement, manipulations, and dynamic change of figures with Dynamic Geometry software), leading to a conflict between conjectures and the outcome of the manipulation of DG software. Peer argumentation then shifted to abductive and deductive considerations towards the solution of the mathematical task.

W. Leibniz are discussed and illuminated by the formalization of infinitesimals in A. Robinson's nonstandard analysis. These similarities suggest that these student conceptions are not mere misconceptions, but are nonstandard conceptions, pieces of knowledge that could be built into a system of real numbers proven to be as mathematically consistent and powerful as the standard system. This provides a new perspective on students' ""struggles"" with the real numbers, and adds to the discussion about the relationship between student conceptions and historical conceptions by focusing on mechanisms for maintaining cognitive and mathematical consistency.","Advanced mathematical thinking; College/university; Constructivism; Historical analysis; Learning theories",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950283093

It builds from dynamic actions on embodied objects to see the effect of those actions as a new embodiment that needs to be calculated accurately and symbolised precisely.

To be able to do their work efficiently, teachers have to be equipped with professional skills and dispositions, with ""teachers' competence"". For their professional growth, we consider indispensable competence in reflection, which is aimed at the teacher's activities with regard to aspects of pedagogy and/or subject-didactics. From the point of view of the goals and content of their teaching and the methods of work (and their realisation), the development of teachers' conscious self-reflection on their own teaching and systematic pursuance of joint reflection with other teachers and/or researchers can promote the teacher's professional growth. In this paper, we show how a selected group of elementary school teachers reflected on their competence in the course of preparing, carrying out and analysing several instruction experiments. The paper is based on samples of teachers' reflections and their gradual development from mere simple conversations based on intuitive perceptions, through searching for effective teaching approaches, to the deep assessment of mathematics teaching from the point of view of topics and their didactic elaboration and to suggestions for the teachers' own experiments. © Springer 2006.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749356583

He also affirmed the importance of the mastery of scientific concepts for the development of the ability to think theoretically, and emphasized the mediating role of semiotic forms and symbol systems in developing this ability. Although historically in mathematics and traditionally in education, algebra followed arithmetic, Vygotskian theory supports the reversal of this sequence in the service of orienting children to the most abstract and general level of understanding initially. This organization of learning activity for the development of algebraic thinking is very different from the introduction of elements of algebra into the study of arithmetic in the early grades. The intended theoretical (algebraic) understanding is attained through appropriation of psychological tools, in the form of specially designed schematics, whose mastery is not merely incidental to but the explicit focus of instruction.

A questionnaire was developed and distributed to teachers of mathematics in 200 English and 40 Hungarian schools teaching children in the 11-14 age range. Factor analyses identified four conceptions of mathematics and five of mathematics teaching. These were compared with those yielded by an earlier study involving the same English teachers and found to be consistent indicating the existence of similar conceptions in different educational systems. Differences and similarities in the strengths with which those conceptions are held were suggestive of both global and national conceptual traditions. The significant similarity to emerge concerned teachers from both countries sharing, with similar strengths, a general conception of mathematics teaching incorporating the teaching of mathematical skills, a variety of classroom approaches including investigations and problem-solving, and a recognition that mathematics provides an essential lifetool. Multi-dimensional scaling indicated that English teachers have their perspectives informed by two underlying, and possibly conflicting, traditions - pedagogic relevance and mathematical utility.

To this end, interviews were conducted with parents and teachers to identify cultural beliefs about learning arithmetic, ten lessons were video-recorded in one classroom in each country to identify classroom social interaction patterns, and interviews were conducted with children to identify the level of sophistication of their arithmetical concepts. Consistent with previous research, the arithmetical understandings of the Chinese children were found to be generally more advanced than those of their American counterparts. The analysis of the other data sources indicates that these differences in understanding reflect two significant differences in the sociocultural context within which Chinese and American children learn arithmetic. First, the arithmetical learning activities in which the Chinese children engaged at home and in school appeared to give them greater opportunities to construct consistenst arithmetical concepts. These differences in the arithmetical learning activities used in the two countries in turn appear to reflect different cultural beliefs about what constitutes normal or natural development when children learn arithmetic. Second, the obligations the Chinese children attempted to fulfill in order to be effective in the classroom were such that they had greater opportunities to explain and to reflect on their arithmetical interpretations and solutions. This in turn gave them greater opportunities to reorganize their thinking and construct increasingly sophisticated arithmetical concepts. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007307272

It shows that, while students may be able to use functions in their practical mathematics, their grasp of the theoretical nature of the function concept may be tenuous and inconsistent. The hypothesis is that students develop prototypes for the function concept in much the same way as they develop prototypes for concepts in everyday life. The definition of the function concept, though given in the curriculum, is not stressed and proves to be inoperative, with their understanding of the concept reliant on properties of familiar prototype examples: those having regular shaped graphs, such as x2 or sin*, those often encountered (possibly erroneously), such as a circle, those in which y is defined as an explicit formula in x, and so on. Investigations reveal significant misconceptions. For example, threequarters of a sample of students starting a university mathematics course considered that a constant function was not a function in either its graphical or algebraic forms, and threequarters thought that a circle is a function. This reveals a wide gulf between the concepts as perceived to be taught and as actually learned by the students. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008755621

One particular research study is reported in some detail since, it is argued, this represents a new level of devolution of agency to teachers to play a self-scaffolding role in their own professional education. The study involved the investigation of an approach to the provision of feedback to teachers about their practice that involved stimulating teacher self-reflection and juxtaposed structure and agency. An observation framework grounded in classroom practice research was developed, and teachers selected elements of that framework to serve as the focus for examining their practice and seeking feedback about that practice. Teachers and researchers examined video-recorded lessons focusing on the teachers’ selected observation elements, and then engaged in feedback conversations about their observations and analyses, and the implications of these for future practice. The approach identified the video record as an artefact of the teacher’s own practice and one which demanded a professional response from the teacher. The balance between structure and agency realised in the study, in combination with the use of video for observation and analysis of practice, facilitated teacher self-reflection and functioned to both support and provoke teacher learning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Teacher professional growth; Teacher self-reflection; Video",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028007950

Differences between the characters of school mathematics and scientific university mathematics as well as different demands related to the learning cultures in both institutions are discussed as possible reasons for this phenomenon. If these assumptions hold, the transition from school to university could not be considered as a continuous mathematical learning path because it would require a realignment of students’ learning strategies. In particular, students could no longer rely on the effective use of school-related individual resources like knowledge, interest, or self-concept. Accordingly, students would face strong challenges in mathematical learning processes at the beginning of their mathematics study at university. In this contribution, we examine these assumptions by investigating the role of individual mathematical learning prerequisites of 182 first-semester university students majoring in mathematics. In line with the assumptions, our results indicate only a marginal influence of school-related mathematical resources on the study success of the first semester. In contrast, specific precursory knowledge related to scientific mathematics and students’ abilities to develop adequate learning strategies turn out as main factors for a successful transition phase.

Here, we outline our mixed-methods design-based research investigation of a pre-kindergarten (Pre-K) classroom where two early childhood educators are incorporating STEM activities. We used a protocol consisting of a list of potential characteristics of effective and appropriate STEM curriculum for young children to structure our classroom observations. We also used semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a questionnaire to collect data from multiple stakeholders (teachers, students, and parents), to examine how STEM activities were incorporated in Pre-K, to explore students’ engagement with STEM concepts, and to investigate parents’ opinions about STEM in general and STEM as experienced by their children.

To improve task design skills, teachers often engage in collaborative lesson planning activities such as lesson study. However, to learn from the process of lesson study, it is important for teachers to notice productively the concepts, students’ confusion and the design of the task. But what researchers mean by productive noticing varies. In this article, I present the FOCUS Framework which highlights two characteristics of productive noticing: having an explicit focus for noticing and focusing noticing through pedagogical reasoning. Using these two characteristics, I develop snapshots of noticing as a representation of practice to present a fine-grained analysis of teacher noticing. Through vignettes of teachers discussing the design of a task to teach fractions, I illustrate how two teachers’ noticing can be analysed and represented using snapshots of noticing. To conclude, I highlight what snapshots of noticing tell us about a teacher’s noticing and suggest ways to use these snapshots in future studies of noticing. © 2016, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Fractions; Mathematics teacher noticing; Productive teaching practices; Representations of practice; Task design",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985916518

We investigated how mathematically skilled adults adapt their strategies to the type of fraction pair. To extend previous research on simple fraction comparison, we used a highly controlled set of more complex fractions with two-digit components. In addition to response times, we recorded eye movements to assess how often the participants fixated on and alternated between specific fraction components. In line with previous studies, our data suggest that the participants preferred componential over holistic strategies for fraction pairs with common numerators or common denominators. Conversely, they preferred holistic over componential strategies for fraction pairs without common components. These results support the assumption that mathematically skilled adults adapt their strategies to the type of fraction pair even in complex fraction comparison.

In the domain of genetics there are two independently developed alternative LPs. In essence, the difference between the two progressions hinges on conjectures regarding the accessibility of Mendelian versus molecular genetics, the conceptual dependencies between them, and the order in which they should be taught. The discrepancies between the two progressions stem, in part, from gaps in the current research base. To address the question of whether learning one aspect of genetics, Mendelian or molecular, supports the learning of the other, we analyzed correlations between students’ test scores on item subsets for Mendelian and molecular genetics on written pre-post assessments. Students were seventh graders who received intensive instruction in Mendelian and molecular genetics. We found that students’ pretest scores on the molecular items were moderately correlated with their posttest scores on the Mendelian genetics item set (but not the other way around). This suggests that molecular genetics understandings may bootstrap the learning of Mendelian genetics.

We found that participating in the session enhanced interest in mathematics. However students encountered some difficulties with algebraic problem-posing, including using precise language, accounting for the intercept term, and conceptualizing a relationship between unknown quantities. Using six cases of more successful and less successful students, we uncovered three themes: students' ""funds of knowledge"" about their interest areas acted as an important scaffold, as did prior knowledge of algebra and a grasp of school norms related to story problems.

The language policies in our contexts share a message of privileging the language of instruction (English or Catalan) over other languages. Our analysis of the two sets of data points to differences in the mathematical participation of students on the basis of which language they use. We develop the argument that, even if languages other than Catalan and English are accepted and certain pedagogies may be close to a language-as-resource approach, the use of the students' languages is politically mediated in such a way that its pedagogical value (as a medium of communication and learning) is not always taken into account in the bilingual mathematics classroom. © 2013 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Bilingualism; Language-as-political; Language-as-resource; Mathematics classroom; Students' learning; Tensions",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881077318

The large-scale assessment represented the common denominator of what constitutes mathematics content knowledge and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge in the 16 participating countries. The country means provided information on the overall teacher performance in these 2 areas. By detecting and explaining differential item functioning (DIF), this paper goes beyond the country means and investigates item-by-item strengths and weaknesses of future teachers. We hypothesized that due to differences in the cultural context, teachers from different countries responded differently to subgroups of test items with certain item characteristics. Content domains, cognitive demands (including item difficulty), and item format represented, in fact, such characteristics: They significantly explained variance in DIF. Country pairs showed similar patterns in the relationship of DIF to the item characteristics. Future teachers from Taiwan and Singapore were particularly strong on mathematics content and constructed-response items. Future teachers from Russia and Poland were particularly strong on items requiring non-standard mathematical operations. The USA and Norway did particularly well on mathematics pedagogical content and data items. Thus, conditional on the countries' mean performance, the knowledge profiles of the future teachers matched the respective national debates. This result points to the influences of the cultural context on mathematics teacher knowledge. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","cognitive demand; content domain; cultural context; differential item functioning (DIF); international study; item difficulty; item format; large-scale assessment; mathematics teacher education; teacher knowledge",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884533165

Second, students' knowledge does not improve instantly when they are involved with argumentation activities, that is, knowledge development in an argumentation process takes time. Third, students' prior knowledge affects their participation in argumentation. Last, there are some patterns that indicate the relationship between argumentation and knowledge.

Freeman, to circumvent issues that emerge when we attempt to determine the field(s) that an argument relates to, proposed a classification of warrants (a priori, empirical, institutional and evaluative). Our approach to analysing teacher arguments proposes an adaptation of Freeman's classification that distinguishes between: epistemological and pedagogical a priori warrants, professional and personal empirical warrants, epistemological and curricular institutional warrants, and evaluative warrants. Our proposition emerged from analyses conducted in the course of a written response and interview study that engages secondary mathematics teachers with classroom scenarios from the mathematical areas of analysis and algebra. The scenarios are hypothetical, grounded on seminal learning and teaching issues, and likely to occur in actual practice. To illustrate our proposed approach to analysing teacher arguments here, we draw on the data we collected through the use of one such scenario, the Tangent Task. We demonstrate how teacher arguments, not analysed for their mathematical accuracy only, can be reconsidered, arguably more productively, in the light of other teacher considerations and priorities: pedagogical, curricular, professional and personal. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Example use; Freeman's classification of warrants; Practical rationality of teaching; Tangent line; Teacher knowledge and beliefs; Toulmin's model for argumentation; Visualisation",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855346339

Data included instructional tasks, samples of student work, and classroom observations, and were compared between the time points to identify changes in teachers' task selection and implementation and to determine whether these changes were sustained over time. Results indicate that teachers increased and sustained their ability to select highlevel instructional tasks and to maintain the level of cognitive demand during instruction.

It is argued that context problems are not a panacea and that categorising problems as contextualised or de-contextualised is less helpful than the consideration of more salient aspects of tasks that impact on their effectiveness. Such aspects also relate to the purposes for and affordances and limitations of particular tasks in relation to the purposes they are intended to serve, along with attention to the contexts in which students learn mathematics.

This paper focuses on a 4-lesson teaching programme which was designed to foster mastery in the context of intensive quantities. Intensive quantities such as density, speed and temperature depend upon proportional relations, require rational number for their representation and are relevant to science. Two versions of the teaching programme were developed, one using ratio representation and the other using fractions. Implementation with 535 children aged 9-11 years revealed that both versions promoted mastery of fractions, whilst the ratio version also supported proportional reasoning. It is suggested that the ratio version provides useful foundations for teaching, even with children who, as with the present sample, have no previous experience of ratios themselves. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.","intensive quantities; mathematics and science education; proportional reasoning; rational number",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952899671

Four groups of students working in pairs participated in the study. In the group discussions, which were tape-recorded and fully transcribed, the students were encouraged to explore strategies for winning a specifically designed dice game based on the sum of two dice. The dice game included four different set-ups of dice designed to bring to the fore different aspects of probability modelling and to offer the student the opportunity to encounter small differences in the mathematical structure of the sample space and of the probability distribution between the four different set-ups. The study describes strategies that the students use when confronted with these different set-ups, what their activities imply in terms of resources in handling random phenomena and what the dice game offers in terms of opportunities for learning probability. In order to explain such meaning-making processes the students' activities are viewed from a perspective that takes into consideration how the students' understanding varies with their interpretations of the situation they are confronted with, i.e., how they contextualize the different set-ups of the dice game. The results show how the students, during the course of the game, reorganize their interpretations of the mathematical content confronting them, and how a variation of guiding principles becomes the object of exploration.

An elective, undergraduate History of Science course was organized in the form of small-group discussion-based inquiries into the history of science from ancient to modern times. Group discussions focused on STATEMENTS OF CRITICAL SIGNIFICANCE (SOCS) prepared by individual students on assigned readings prior to each class meeting. Small-group discussions were followed by a synthesis, facilitated by the instructor, of points raised in SOCS and other ideas central to the reading. The overarching goal of these activities was to help students see the multifaceted nature of the scientific enterprise in the context of social, political, cultural, and religious milieu of the time period and the geographic setting within which specific scientific activities and developments took place. The impact of this course on student understanding of the NOSE was assessed through the use of VIEWS ON SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY-SOCIETY (VOSTS) instrument administered as pre- and post-test. Qualitative data regarding student understanding of the NOSE were furnished by the final exam on the NOSE written in the form of SOCS at the end of semester.

Wepropose a model of the complexity of a wordproblem about such situation. The model hasseveral variables, namely, 1) the ratio ofthe number of quantities that are beingcompared to the number of referencequantities (the 'reference ratio'); 2) thescheme of the situation, i.e. the type ofrelation between the two given elementarycomparison relations; 3) the order ofpresenting the elementary comparisonrelations; 4) the words used to describethe multiplicative comparison relations (somany times 'more' Vs so many times 'less').The choice of the values of these variablesin the formulation of a problem is assumedto affect the solver's solution strategy.The most important construct of the modelis what we have called the 'complexitylevel' of a solution, namely, the number ofoperations (theoretically) needed to gofrom the text of the problem to analgebraic representation of this solution.An analysis, in terms of the model, of wordproblems that can be formulated about thiskind of situation makes it clear that,while there are several options in solvinga given problem in algebraic terms, some ofthem are simpler (have a lower level ofcomplexity), from the formal standpoint,than others. In fact, the most efficientchoice for the independent variable is onewhich, in the scheme of the situation,stands in the position of the 'connector'between the two elementary comparisonrelations. The model is used in analyzingsolution strategies of a set of twelveproblems about this type of multiplicativecomparative situation by 104 teachers and132 15 years old students. In particular,we identify their choices of theindependent variable and discuss theirsolutions in terms of levels of complexity.We also look at their preferences forinterpreting the texts of the problems interms of the word 'more' rather than'less'. One of our observations is that,even if they were not aware of it, thesubjects in the study preferred solutionswith a minimal route. There were, however,some exceptions in cases where subjectspreferred to use the least value as theindependent variable, as well as totranslate the 'less' relations into the'more' relations regardless of the highcomplexity of this solution. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Comparison relation; Complexity; More - less; Multiplicative comparison; Reference; Scheme; Text-base; Two-step word problems",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28044461967

To analyze the differentiation of instrumental genesis, we then have taken interest in students’ behaviour and we propose a method enabling us to constitute a typology of extreme behaviour in environments of symbolic calculators.

In this paper, as an attempt to reconceptualise students' conceptions of mathematics, the notion of ""the lived space of mathematics learning"" is introduced, referring to the space experienced by learners and spanned by all the dimensions in which problems in mathematics vary from each other, and from non-mathematical problems. This ""lived space"" constrains what the learners will regard as mathematics and as mathematics learning, and constrains therefore their conceptions of mathematics and mathematics learning. Based on this understanding, the present study is aimed at investigating the relationship between students' conceptions of mathematics and how they actually tackle mathematical problems. By using a variety of open-ended non-routine mathematical problems, the extent of variations in students' conceptions of mathematics and in their lived space of mathematics learning were explored. Non-routine mathematics problems as tasks could bring about a sharp contrast with the usual problems in their classroom learning. Students were interviewed after they were asked to attempt several mathematical problems, some being routine and some open-ended. Through a detailed analysis of students' interview protocols, characteristic features of their conceptions of mathematics and mathematics learning have been revealed. These were discussed in terms of the existing classroom teaching and examination culture. It is argued that the present notion of the lived space can also point to ways to broaden students' current narrow conceptions of mathematics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper will refer to such personal conception as natural infinities. Research has shown that individuals' natural conceptions of infinity are 'labile and self-contradictory' (Fischbein et al., 1979, p. 31). The formal approach to mathematics in the twentieth century attempted to rationalize these inconsistencies by selecting a finite list of specific properties (or axioms) from which the conception of a formal infinity is built by formal deduction. By beginning with different properties of finite numbers, such as counting, ordering or arithmetic, different formal systems may be developed. Counting and ordering lead to cardinal and ordinal number theory and the properties of arithmetic lead to ordered fields that may contain infinite and infinitesimal quantities. Cardinal and ordinal numbers can be added and multiplied but not divided or subtracted. The operations of cardinals are commutative, but the operations of ordinals are not. Meanwhile an ordered field has a full system of arithmetic in which the reciprocals of infinite elements are infinitesimals. Thus, while natural concepts of infinity may contain built-in contradictions, there are several different kinds of formal infinity, each with its own coherent properties, yet each system having properties that differ from the others. The construction of both natural and formal infinities are products of human thought and so may be considered in terms of 'embodied cognition' (Lakoff and Nunez, 2000). The viewpoint forwarded here, however, is that formal deduction focuses as far as possible on formal logic in preference to perceptual imagery, developing a network of formal properties that do not depend on specific embodiments. Indeed, I shall show that formal theory can lead to structure theorems, whose formal properties may then be re-interpreted as a more subtle form of embodied imagery. Not only can natural embodied theory inspire theorems to be proved formally, but formal theory can also feed back into human embodiment, now subtly enhanced by the underlying network of formal relationships. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-52549119932

An investigation on first-year students (mathematics and chemistry) has been carried out in which several conceptions („Vorstellungen”) of mathematics have been identified and measured. It can be proved that these components partly constitute a “world view” and do take effect on doing mathematics. The results show that the factors of a “word view” influence others not monocausally, bu reciprocally whereby complexes of components are constituted. One complex covers the attitudes („Haltungen”) concerning the question whether and in how far mathematics is a process (of cognition, intellectual progress and building theory) or a system (e.g. a “toolbox” and a “formulary” as well as an abstract, formal theory). A second complex consists of the attitudes with respect to “pleasure in mathematics education” (connected with “don’t separate school mathematics from mathematics”), “self-assessment of the current mathematical performance” and “learning not only for the written class test; derivations and proofs are not unimportant”. Thus a “mathematical world view” turns out to be a complex structure which essentially influences the learning and doing of mathematics, and both of the mentioned complexes characterize a prototype of a “mathematical world view” which is ideal for mathematical performance. The students’ “mathematical world views” contain some attitudes which have either detrimental or more promoting attitudes concerning learning and doing of mathematics. Especially doubtful or even serious though not surprising or unexpected is the fact that the “world view” of the “chemists” (compared to that of the “mathematicians”) provides clearly worse conditions for learning and doing mathematics. The “chemists” show a more restricted “world view”, typically for users and “customers”, whereas the “mathematicians” rather turned out to be producers of mathematics. © 1994, GDM - Gesellschaft für Didaktik der Mathematik.

We show how this concept occurs in high-school students at a prior, or at best, at the same level, as in Bernard Bolzano's conceptualization (as defined in his work The Paradoxes of Infinity). Furthermore, in terms of the historical development of the concept, the students' conceptualization has intra-objectal stage characteristics. Within the same framework, we show how Cantor's work fits into the inter-objectal stage, as well as presenting the difficulties encountered by students in order to reach this stage, given the current curricular structure.

Infinite measuring numbers are part of a coherent number system extending the real numbers, including both infinitely large and infinitely small quantities. A suitable extension is the superreal number system described here; an alternative extension is the hyperreal number field used in non-standard analysis which is also mentioned. Various theorems are proved in careful detail to illustrate that certain properties of infinity which might be considered 'false' in a cardinal sense are 'true' in a measuring sense. Thus cardinal infinity is now only one of a choice of possible extensions of the number concept to the infinite case. It is therefore inappropriate to judge the 'correctness' of intuitions of infinity within a cardinal framework alone, especially those intuitions which relate to measurement rather than one-one correspondence. The same comments apply in general to the analysis of naive intuitions within an extrapolated formal framework. © 1980 D.

We begin our paper by summarizing the key findings of these reviews, pointing to various categorizations proposed by their authors, and the key critiques raised therein. We then report on our more recent review of identity literature in mathematics education published in the top twenty mathematics education journals over the past 5 years (47 articles in total). This review enables us firstly to speak descriptively about the extent to which the field is evolving (or not) in relation to earlier findings (dominant regions, focus of research, methods and perspectives used). Secondly, following deeper analysis of the papers, we speak to the way in which the field is addressing (or not) key critiques raised by reviews. Our analysis points to several theoretical, methodological and empirical absences and challenges requiring further engagement. We further highlight key absences in the research, particularly a lack of cross-national comparative studies and studies that connect learner and teacher identities. We then provide a summary discussion and analysis of the contributions of the present special issue papers and engage with how these take the field forward.

Studies predominantly rely on the so-called eye-mind hypothesis (EMH), which posits that what persons fixate on closely relates to what they process. Given that the EMH was developed in reading research, we see the risk that implicit assumptions are tacitly adopted in mathematics even though they may not apply in this domain. This article investigates to what extent the EMH applies in mathematics—geometry in particular—and aims to lift the discussion of what inferences can be validly made from eye-tracking data. We use a case study to investigate the need for a refinement of the use of the EMH. In a stimulated recall interview, a student described his original thoughts perusing a gaze-overlaid video recorded when he was working on a geometry problem. Our findings contribute to better a understanding of when and how the EMH applies in the subdomain of geometry. In particular, we identify patterns of eye movements that provide valuable information on students’ geometry problem solving: certain patterns where the eye fixates on what the student is processing and others where the EMH does not hold. Identifying such patterns may contribute to an interpretation theory for students’ eye movements in geometry—exemplifying a domain-specific theory that may reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty that eye tracking data analysis has. © 2019, The Author(s).","Eye movements; Eye tracking; Eye-mind hypothesis; Geometry",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061182709

Thinking of language as a resource has been important in countering deficit perspectives on language diversity in mathematics classrooms, but also has some limitations, including its materialization of language and a tendency to separate different aspects of language use. I propose a theoretical framework, based on “sources of meaning” to address these limitations, drawing on Bakhtinian theory and the contemporary sociolinguistics of multilingualism. This framework includes four principles: language is agentive; meaning is relational; language is diverse; and language is stratified and stratifying. It also uses the sociolinguistic idea of repertoires to develop an integrated understanding of students’ meaning making in mathematics.

It is a widespread view that problem-solving skills help individuals to overcome the problems easily in their daily lives. An individual with problem-solving skills is a self-confident, creative and independent thinker. It can be explicable that the societies formed by these individuals can easily solve the problems. In this vein, this study is aimed to determine the relationship between the acquisition of problem-solving skills that play an important role in mathematics alongside two dimensions of classroom management which are time management and plan-program management. It is thought that there is a close relationship between these two dimensions; problem-solving skills. The types of problems are divided into two; routine and non-routine. The aim is to get opinions about how these problems will be taught by mathematics teachers, at what level they will be used in class and what methods they will use for them. The study was conducted by doing a content analysis of qualitative research methods. The sample group which is randomly determined from five provinces of North Cyprus is composed of mathematics teachers who teach at the 9th grade level. The data was collected through semi-structured interview forms. Content analysis technique was used in the evaluation of the obtained data. As a result, it was found out that the mathematics teachers who work in the Ministry of National Education and teach at the 9th grade, have been given importance to problem-solving skills such as, problem-solving duration and problem-solving methods in their classes. In addition, the teachers pointed out that the time given is not sufficient at schools and they could not give enough importance to plan-program activities.

A questionnaire survey was conducted with a sample of the three types of stakeholders at Tianjin University, one of the largest academic institutions and the earliest to implement green campus development initiatives in China. Structural equation modeling tested a causal model of awareness, behaviors, and other explanatory variables. The results found that pro-environmental behaviors were more likely than awareness and the respondents engaged in private more than in public pro-environmental behaviors. Chinese social and cultural factors influenced pro-environmental behavior, particularly among the administrators, which informs our understanding of the reasons for the awareness-behavior gap.

Recent advances in technology, however, offer new approaches for the use of video with teachers. We claim that these new technologies provide important opportunities for teacher learning prior to the viewing and discussion of video with colleagues. In particular, we believe that important teacher learning can occur from the activities of (1) capturing video from one’s own classroom and (2) selecting clips to share with others. The goal of this article is to introduce key strategies that three groups of middle and high school mathematics teachers use prior to, during, and after instruction as they engage in this work.

The aim of this paper is to report student and teacher perceptions of the Encouraging Activity to Stimulate Young Minds program, a school-based physical activity integration intervention designed to enhance learning and engagement in mathematics and increase physical activity levels in children using movement-based learning experiences. Four classroom teachers were interviewed and 66 students participated in focus groups following the 6-week intervention. The program provided positive experiences for teachers and students, both in terms of enjoyment and engagement, while ensuring high quality learning experiences. Embedding movement-based learning across mathematics, had a significant positive effect on children's enjoyment and engagement without compromising the quality of learning. © Authors.","Engagement; Mathematics; Physical activity; Primary school; Quality teaching",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019085652

Within the research literature, a number of theoretical frameworks relating to the teaching of different aspects of proof and proving are evident. In our work, we are focusing on secondary school students learning the structure of deductive proofs and, in this paper, we propose a theoretical framework based on this aspect of proof education. In our framework, we capture students’ understanding of the structure of deductive proofs in terms of three levels of increasing sophistication: Pre-structural, Partial-structural, and Holistic-structural, with the Partial-structural level further divided into two sub-levels: Elemental and Relational. In this paper, we apply the framework to data from our classroom research in which secondary school students (aged 14) tackled a series of lessons that provided an introduction to proof problems involving congruent triangles. Using data from the transcribed lessons, we focus in particular on students who displayed the tendency to accept a proof that contained logical circularity. From the perspective of our framework, we illustrate what we argue are two independent aspects of Relational understanding of the Partial-structural level, those of universal instantiation and hypothetical syllogism, and contend that accepting logical circularity can be an indicator of lack of understanding of syllogism. These findings can inform how teaching approaches might be improved so that students develop a more secure understanding of deductive proofs and proving in geometry. © 2016, The Author(s).","Hypothetical syllogism; Proof; Structure; Understanding; Universal instantiation",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988353588

They place more stress on the process of concept development, which is viewed as a source of students’ failures in transfer. To achieve mathematical understanding, the Chinese teachers emphasize strategies such as reinventing a concept, verbalizing a concept, and using examples and comparisons for analogical reasoning.

A contributory factor to this situation is the need for student work to be marked reliably by a large number of markers of varied experience and competence. We report a study that tested an alternative approach to assessment, called comparative judgement, which may represent a superior method for assessing open-ended questions that encourage a range of unpredictable responses. An innovative problem solving examination paper was specially designed by examiners, evaluated by mathematics teachers, and administered to 750 secondary school students of varied mathematical achievement. The students’ work was then assessed by mathematics education experts using comparative judgement as well as a specially designed, resource-intensive marking procedure. We report two main findings from the research.

Specifically, enhancing students’ motivation in the mathematics classroom is an important issue for teachers and researchers, due to its relation to students’ behavior and achievement. This paper utilized achievement goal theory—an important theoretical prospect on students’ motivation in school settings—to investigate the existence of a model presenting the relation between motivation and other affective constructs and students’ performance in mathematics. In this regard, two types of tests were administered to 321 sixth grade students measuring their motivation and other affective constructs and their performance in mathematics. Using structural equation modeling, we examined the associations among the affective constructs, motivation, and the extent to which these constructs influence students’ performance and interest in mathematics. The data revealed that students’ performance and their interest in mathematics were influenced by fear of failure, self-efficacy beliefs, and achievement goals. We discuss these findings in terms of teaching implications in the mathematics classroom. © 2014, National Science Council, Taiwan.","achievement goals; structural equation modeling; students’ performance",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891657006

The existence of this distinct gap is further supported by evidence from qualitative coding that students with a high level of representational fluency use a greater number of representations and more visual and symbolic representations to explain their answers.

We report on mathematics and science subject combination choices made by students in the New South Wales (NSW) Higher School Certificate (HSC) between 2001 and 2013 and show a substantial decline in the proportion of students undertaking at least one maths and one science subject. We identify a decline in intermediate (2 unit) mathematics as central to the decline in maths and science combinations and explore this in two further analyses: examining HSC maths participation in general; and among students receiving offers for university Initial Teacher Education (ITE). Between 2001 and 2013 the proportion of students going on to study HSC without any maths tripled (from 3.2 to 9.7%), a small increase is seen in elementary level General maths (from 28.9 to 31.9), while intermediate, 2 unit maths, declined (16.8 to 11.4) and advanced, extension courses, remained stable. For students receiving ITE university offers between 2001 and 2013 there was: a tripling in the proportion with no mathematics at HSC (4.8 to 15.6%); with a large and growing majority in General maths (55.1 to 64.5%); and halving of 2 Unit (30.6 to 14.2%) and extension courses (9.5 to 5.46%). Together these analyses raise serious concerns for maths and numeracy standards and for STEM education and industry.

Teacher education programs in many countries therefore provide corresponding opportunities to learn (OTL), and in-school experience is regarded as a core component of OTL fostering knowledge in the area of general pedagogy. However, empirical research on the effectiveness of school experiences during teacher education does not tell us precisely how different kinds of OTL are related to GPK. This paper first reports on the conceptualizing of the GPK test in the context of TEDS-M. Then the relationship between practical in-school OTL of German and US future primary teachers and their GPK is investigated. On the basis of results from Latent-Class Analysis using two core indicators of in-school OTL (the length of time spent on teaching students and the extent of being supported by a mentor or supervisor), three types of future primary teachers in both the US and Germany are distinguished: “starting” (type 1), “autonomous” (type 2), and “balanced” (type 3). In both countries, type 3 future primary teachers reported that they had had OTL to reflect on and improve their teaching to a larger extent than the type 1 teachers. Type 3 teachers also generally achieved better GPK test results than type 1 teachers. Furthermore, there is also a tendency that type 3 future teachers show better results than type 2. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the quality of future teachers’ activities during in-school practicum matters with regard to important outcomes of teacher education, making in-school OTL an effective component of teacher education.

In particular, we will argue that in each case the instructor was ultimately constrained by her knowledge of how students were thinking about the mathematics. © 2011.","Listening; Mathematical knowledge for teaching; Realistic mathematics education; Teacher practices; Undergraduate teaching",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155163024

We conducted teaching experiments with eight students in grades 2 and 3, based on our hypothetical learning trajectory for length to check its coherence and to strengthen the domain-specific model for learning and teaching. We checked the hierarchical structure of the trajectory by generating formative instructional task loops with each student and examining the consistency between our predictions and students' ways of reasoning. We found that attending to intervals as countable units was not an adequate instructional support for progress into the Consistent Length Measurer level; rather, students must integrate spaces, hash marks, and number labels on rulers all at once. The findings have implications for teaching measure-related topics, delineating a typical developmental transition from inconsistent to consistent counting strategies for length measuring.

We address the question of how a teacher participating in dual design research can learn to scaffold students' development of the language required for mathematical learning in multilingual classrooms. Empirical data were collected from two teaching experiments (each with 8 lessons, and 21 and 22 students, aged 11-12 years), for which lesson series about line graphs were co-designed by the researchers and the teacher. The teacher's learning process was promoted (e.g. by conducting stimulated recall interviews and providing feedback) and traced (e.g. by carrying out 5 pre- and post-interviews before and after the teaching experiments). An analytic framework for teachers' reported and derived learning outcomes was used to analyse preand post-interviews. The teacher's learning process was analysed in terms of changes in knowledge and beliefs, changes in practice and intentions for practice. Further analysis showed that this learning process could be attributed to the characteristics of dual design research, for instance the cyclic and interventionist character, the continuous process of prediction and reflection that lies at its heart, and the process of co-designing complemented with stimulated recall interviews. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2011.","Design research; Mathematics teacher's expertise; Multilingual classrooms; Scaffolding language",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867438718

In such semiotic actions, the students' argumentation and proof activities are managed and guided according to two intertwined modalities of control, which we call semiotic and theoretic control.

A quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent pre-test-post-test control group (CG) was used to compare the outcomes of the intervention. The subjects of the study were 63 grade 6 (aged 12 and 13) students who were in two different classes and taught by two different teachers. The study was undertaken in ten class hours over a 4-week period, during which the topics related to matter and heat concepts were covered as a part of the regular Turkish Science and Technology Curriculum. Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two classes in terms of their achievements in the Science and Technology course (t(63) = -0.943, p > 0.05). Accordingly, one of the classes was randomly selected as the experimental group (EG). A modified version of the Draw-a-Scientist Test, in conjunction with individual interviews, was used to assess students' images of scientists at the beginning and end of the study. The results showed that students who had followed evidence-informed instruction had significant gains from the pre-test to the post-test regarding their images of scientists compared to students with traditional instruction. Many students in the EG started to view scientists as realistic people rather than as extraordinary people or mythical creatures. Nevertheless, several students in the CG held images of scientists and their work which fit a stereotype of scientists as male, bald, bespectacled, wearing a laboratory coat, working alone in a laboratory environment and having a limited social life. Some possible implications for teaching and further research are discussed. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.","evidence-based practice; evidence-informed practice; images of science and scientists",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955574274

In this study we propose that, on novel tasks, individuals with high cognitive abilities outperform less able individuals, because they allocate a higher amount of resources. On familiar tasks, however, individuals with higher abilities profit from more efficient processes compared to individuals of lower cognitive abilities. We tested this hypothesis by administering to 11th graders a geometric analogy task not practiced at school and an algebraic transformation task comprising operations that are routinely required during mathematical courses. General cognitive abilities were measured with Ravens Advanced Progressive matrices (fluid intelligence), the d2 (focused attention) and KAI-N (working memory capacity). Resource allocation was measured by assessing pupil diameter during the problem-solving process. Performance on both the analogy and the algebra task was correlated with general cognitive abilities, especially fluid intelligence. In line with our assumptions, a positive correlation between fluid intelligence and resource allocation was observed in the novel geometric analogy task, whereas the correlation was not significant in the more familiar algebra task. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2010.","Fluid intelligence; Focused attention; Mathematical cognition; Pupillary response; Pupillometry; Resource allocation; Working memory capacity",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867565487

The paper develops a particular understanding of ethical responsibility based on the writings of Emanuel Levinas and discusses its implication for decision making on the curriculum and pedagogy in mathematics education. The paper argues that such an approach is consistent with a critical mathematics approach; however, it highlights the need to balance the concern about equity with that of quality.

Implicit rationale of the studies is that seeing these inter-relations occurs naturally and that we have to find the cognitive processes that can explain exceptions from this rule. Based on a review of key findings from cognitive research on knowledge acquisition we argue that a Knowledge Integration Perspective would be more adequate in which children acquire different concepts and procedures in different situations. Only experts but not children who are new in a domain can see their abstract mathematical inter-relations.

These studies have documented a rich variety of arithmetic practices involved in activities such as tailoring, carpet laying, dieting, or grocery shopping. More importantly, these studies have helped to rectify outmoded models of rationality, cognition, and (school) instruction. Despite these important achievements, doubts can be raised about the ways in which theoretical conclusions have been drawn from empirical materials. Furthermore, while these studies rightly criticised prevalent theories of rationality and cognition as too simplistic to account for everyday activities, it seems that some of the proposed alternatives suffer from similar flaws (i.e., are straightforward inversions of the to-be-opposed theories, rather than more nuanced views on complicated issues). In this article we illustrate our sceptical view by discussing four case studies in Jean Lave's pioneering and influential 'Cognition in Practice' (1988). By looking at the case studies in detail, we investigate how Lave's conclusions relate to the empirical materials and offer alternative characterisations. In particular, we question whether the empirical studies demonstrate the existence of two different kinds of mathematics ('everyday' and 'school,' or 'formal' and 'informal') and whether school instruction tries to replace the former with the latter. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Everyday mathematics; Jean Lave; School mathematics; Situated learning; Street mathematics",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649109693

The study is based on student teachers' drawings of themselves in a typical classroom situation and four open questions. Data was collected from 104 freshman science student teachers, and evaluated based on the basic tenets of Grounded Theory. Applying Grounded Theory led to a framework of categorising the student teachers' beliefs in three categories: (I) Beliefs about Classroom Organisation, (II) Beliefs about Teaching Objectives, and (III) Epistemological Beliefs. All three categories were expanded to a dimension between more traditional beliefs and beliefs in line with modern educational theory. The participants in the study were from different groups of student teachers in one of four domains of science teaching: secondary school Biology, Chemistry or Physics or Primary Science. The tool proved to be interesting for gaining insights into the beliefs of freshman science student teachers. The initial results from this case study indicate that secondary student teachers of Chemistry and, even moreso, Physics hold teacher- and content-structure-centred beliefs about science teaching and learning, whereas Biology student teachers, and even more pronouncedly Primary Science student teachers, hold more student-centred and scientific literacy-oriented beliefs.

However, many PD programs for science and mathematics teachers fall short because they fail to consider teacher background, experience, knowledge, beliefs, and needs (Loucks-Horsley, Love, Stiles, Mundry, & Hewson, 2003). To develop more effective PD systems, it is necessary to assess and identify teachers' PD needs, expectations, experiences and constraints. In this manuscript, we describe the findings from a study that examined the PD experiences, needs, expectations, and constraints of middle and high school science and mathematics teachers in one state in the U.S. We examine similarities and differences between science and mathematics teachers and among teachers from urban, suburban and rural schools. The findings from this study suggest that mathematics and science teachers participate in a minimal amount of PD and that a number of factors contribute to this reality. Furthermore, science and mathematics teachers do not experience effective PD learning environments described by Bransford, Brown & Cocking (2000) and there is a mismatch between teachers' PD needs and experiences.

It argues that an abstraction is a consolidated construction that can be used to create new constructions. Newly formed constructions are fragile entities. In the course of consolidating a construction this student creates connections between the new construction and already established mathematical knowledge and develops a language to describe and guide mathematical actions related to the construction. The resulting abstraction is a more resilient form of the construction and the student is able to justify his assertions.

This sense-making manifested itself in the ways in which students employed initial strategies, notation, prior knowledge and experiences, and concrete examples in the proof construction process. These differences were also seen when students were asked to determine the validity of completed proofs.

The fact that, in spite of the ongoing efforts toward reform in mathematics education, many countries found the results of the international measurements of their students' achievements rather disappointing led the ICME 10 Program Committee to create the Survey Team on Relations between Mathematics Education Research and Practice. The team, coordinated by the author of this talk, and including Aline Robert from France, Ole Skovsmose from Denmark, Yoshihiko Hashimoto from Japan, and Gelsa Knijnik from Brazil, was invited to reflect on the question of how research has been informing the practice of mathematics education over the last decade. Following the invitation, the Survey Team turned to the members of the mathematics education community asking them to answer three queries about their own work: (1) How would you describe the essence of your work in mathematics education over the last 5 years or so? (2) During this period, to what extent was your work stirred and influenced by the current state of mathematics education in your country and/or in the world? (3) Do you think that the work done by you and by your colleagues over the last five years or so had, or is going to have, an actual impact on the practice of mathematics education? Analysis of the 74 responses received from all over the world revealed several interesting trends.

Initially the lessons were trialed by the researchers in two classrooms. The lessons were then implemented in a further two classrooms by two classroom teachers in conjunction with the researchers.

Two distinct themes emerged from analysis of the results- first, the relationship between the activities and the development of geometric thinking skills, and second, the relationship between the design of the materials, and the exploration process. This article focuses on the latter. An analysis of the data showed that task question and sketch provision must work together to create an environment for exploration. It also indicated that explicit attention to visual interpretation and exploration using change is required in order for students to benefit fully from their experiences with pre-constructed dynamic geometry sketches. This article draws attention to the idea that pre-constructed dynamic sketches(whether web-based or not) and accompanying materials are central elements of the learning activity of which they are a part,and therefore, that decisions about their design have the potential to support or impede the development of exploration strategies and geometric thinking skills. An examination of student responses to particular questions in light of visual and dynamic geometry research suggests that through the materials we may be able to improve students' use of the mathematical investigation process in exploring pre-constructed dynamic geometry sketches. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Dynamic geometry; Learning materials; Mathematics education; Pre-constructed sketch; Secondary school; Task design",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18944370679

Three case studies show a great variance in the development of the students’ proof skills. Some students come to university with excellent PUPAs and continue to thrive in a proof environment. Others enter university with poor PUPAs and unfortunately graduate without a significant change in their proof skills and attitudes. Still others come with poor proof skills but do showsome growth during their undergraduate mathematics programs.

Next, student comparisons are made using instruments developed to measure conceptual understanding of arithmetic and beliefs and motivation for learning mathematics. The results of the analyses indicate that after 2 years in problem-centered classes, students have significantly higher achievement on standardized achievement measures, better conceptual understanding, and more task-oriented beliefs for learning mathematics than do those in textbook instruction. In addition, these differences remain after problem-centered students return to classes using textbook instruction. Comparisons of pupils in problem-centered classes for only 1 year reveal that after returning to textbook instruction, these students' mathematical achievement and beliefs are more similar to the textbook group.

Here are some of the observations that emerged from analysis of the interviews. First, students show a strong need for ""canonical"", unique, step-by-step procedures and tend to get stuck of having to deal with some degrees of freedom in their choices. Second, students exhibit various degrees of personification and localization in their language, as in ""I can find a function that takes every element of G to every element of G′"" vs. ""there exists a function from G to G′"". Third, when having to deal with a list of properties, students choose first the properties they perceive as simpler; however, it turns out that their choice depends on the type of the task and the type of complexity involved. That is, in tasks involving groups in general, students mostly prefer to work with properties which are syntactically simple, whereas in tasks involving specific groups, students prefer properties which are computationally simpler. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040531835

Preliminary analysis shows that, while the hypothesis that discussion aids understanding is very attractive, evidence to support the hypothesis has been limited. Classroom observations during the first year of the study have led to a method of classification of mathematical talk in the classroom which we expect will prove useful in investigating links between mathematical discussion and mathematical understanding. The ability to 'say what you mean and mean what you say' should be one of the outcomes of good mathematics teaching .... Pupils need the explicit help, which can only be given by extended discussion, to establish these relationships (between different mathematical topics); even pupils whose mathematics attainment is high do not easily do this themselves. (Cockcroft, 1982, England) In all other topics, we saw teachers there (Kitamaeno School in Tokyo) using peer group dialogues ... (they) justified their use of group dialogue because of their large classes (35-43) and the unusually independent spirit of many of the 600 pupils. Mathematics achievement was very high by American standards. (Easley, 1984, on a Japanese project) We need to recognise the importance of verbalisation. Putting thoughts into words requires students to organise their thinking and to confront their incomplete understanding. Listening to others affords them the opportunities to contemplate the thinking of others and to consider the implications for their own understanding.

The aims of the work were: (i) To identify a framework which describes children's orders of acquisition of number concepts. (ii) To develop a diagnostic assessment instrument capable of describing children's understanding of number (iii) To devise, carry out and evaluate teaching and activities which would extend the children's understanding of number. Achievement of the first two aims is described in an earlier paper (Denvir and Brown, 1986a). The present paper describes how the third aim was achieved in two teaching studies. Both were based on the descriptive framework and children's performances in the diagnostic assessment interview. However the two studies differed in approach. In the pilot study pupils were taught individually and specific teaching points were selected for each child. In contrast to this, children who participated in the main study were taught as part of a group whose members had reached a similar level of understanding but had acquired slightly different skills. Consequently the focus was less on teaching specific points and more on linking different aspects of certain concepts. In both studies the pupil's performances improved between pre and post tests, suggesting that the framework and the pupils' performances in the diagnostic assessment interviews may provide a useful basis for designing a remedial teaching programme. © 1986 D.

To make the discussion as precise as possible a distinction is made between three alternatives in ME: Structuralism, pragmatism, and process-orientation. These alternatives are related to the key terms of CE in order to show the extent to which ME and CE contradict each other. The conclusion is that there does not exist any integration - nor even any close relationship-between ME and CE. Finally, this result is discussed in the light of the following two theses: (A) It is necessary to increase the interaction between ME and CE, if ME is not to degenerate into one of the most important ways of socializing students into the technological society and at the same time destroying the possibilities for developing a critical attitude towards precisely this technological society. (B) It is important for CE to interact with subjects from the technical sciences, and among these ME, if CE is not to be taken over by the technological development and fade away into an unimportant and uncritical educational theory. © 1985 D.

The two main objectives of this research were to clarify the notion of numeration and to make explicit, as much as possible, what an understanding of this concept implies. We were also concerned, not to limit ourselves to only a theoretical study, but to make our research results usable by teachers. We shall provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical framework that specifies the concept of numeration in a much wider sense than is usually encountered in primary-school mathematics (discussed in Part A). According to this analysis we will describe the reference framework (Part B) that can be used for purposes of learning and evaluation of the numeration concept. In order to make the understanding of numeration by children more explicit, the research in 1979 focussed its activities on the construction of 'structured items' which we then administered in interviews to 160 children from the ages of 6 to 10. A description of these items and the administration details will be presented (Part C) and an analysis of a few item's results will be given (Part D). In the conclusion, we examine the findings with a view to searching for practical teaching principles for numeration and for future research orientations. © 1982 D.

In this survey paper, we describe how the internet is transforming the mathematics classroom and mathematics teacher education. We use as references several reviews of use of the internet in mathematics education settings made in recent years to determine how the field has evolved. We identify three domains in which new approaches are being generated by mathematic educators: principles of design of new settings; social interaction and construction knowledge; and tools and resources. The papers in this issue reflect different perspectives developed in the last decade in these three domains, providing evidence of the advances in theoretical frameworks and support in the generation of new meanings for old constructs such as ‘tool’, ‘resources’ or ‘learning setting’. We firstly highlight the different ways in which the use of digital technologies generates new ways of thinking about mathematics and the settings in which it is learnt, and how mathematics teacher educators frame the new initiatives of initial training and professional development. In this survey paper, we identify trends for future research regarding theoretical and methodological aspects, and recognise new opportunities requiring further engagement. © 2020, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Blended learning; Collaboration; Humans-with-media; Hyper-personalisation; Learning environments; Learning management system; Mathematics teacher education; Mathematics teaching; MOOC",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087640069

The authors applied theoretical and empirical methods, such as observation, polling, composing a Likert scale, calculation of Spearman ranking correlation coefficients, tabular and diagram techniques of data visualization, etc., which enabled to achieve the set goal. The score method based on Likert scale enabled to reveal the problem aspects of forming the informational and digital environment of a university. Also, these techniques enabled to quantitatively assess each problem, assess their significance and reveal the degree of each factor's relation to each problem of using the information and communication technologies at a university. University professors were polled about using innovative information technologies in order to both enhance the education efficiency and apply new pedagogical concepts and techniques. The poll revealed the problem aspects impeding the development of the informational environment. The research results are presented as a series of diagrams, reliably characterizing the issues which the university professors face when implementing the educational process. Besides, a number of indicators were calculated to determine the correlation coefficients, which enabled to quantitatively assess the degree of correlation between the two series of the compared quantitative indicators. The research revealed the factors impeding the development of the informational environment of a university. Awareness of these factors by the university administration and teaching staff would allow overcoming them, with a view of increasing the quality of educational services. The authors are making a substantiated conclusion that, despite certain difficulties, the informational technologies integrated into the educational process comply with the modern requirements of the society and enhance the competencies of both the students and professors participating in the educational process. © 2019 by the authors.","Educational process; Higher education; Informational and digital environment; Innovative processes; Issues; Likert scale",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069496745

STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, engineering stands out as a challenging area to implement. In addition, most early engineering education research centers on curriculum and instruction rather than students’ understanding and application of models and content knowledge to a design project (Johri and Olds, Journal of Engineering Education, 100(1):151–185, 2011). For this study, we created a play-based STEM activity which helps students understand and apply the concept of volume in creating clay boats through the practices of engineering design. Three students voluntarily participated in this study. Data sources included interviews, photocopies of boats, and observation field notes which were analyzed using a comprehensive cross-case analysis. Findings indicate that the common pattern is rather intuitive when students define engineering problems using different criteria. Also, students’ solutions to engineering problems are associated with their experiential ideas of reality. How students express their understanding of volume is correlated to the way of their structuring volume. Lastly, students understand the concept of volume gradually while going through the practices of engineering design. Implications are discussed in terms of how engineering education contributes to students’ understanding of volume. © 2016, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Engineering design; Engineering education; STEM; Volume; Young children",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994201635

The first part is a database comprising numerous subdatabases, which store login data and various levels of test questions of different levels. The second part is an arithmetic processing unit with a login module that produces a login interface to receive users' accounts and passwords. The login module is electronically connected to the database system so that the module can verify the input accounts and passwords with the login data stored in the database. The unit also randomly selects questions from different levels to form evaluation sets and generates an evaluation interface. In addition, the device features an input unit for inputting instructions and a display unit to display interfaces during use. Knowledge innovation and management accelerates with the prevalence of online assessment and learning because it has no difficulties in breaking through the limits of both space and time. Previous studies developing English evaluation and teaching device systems have rarely been researched from the dual perspective of developing the information technology system and learning and teaching language. Utilising the technology acceptance model as our fundamental theory to design the use of learning system is a must for the English e-learners. © 2018 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive science; Computer-assisted language learning; Learning management system; Online learning behaviour; Semantics; Technology acceptance model",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046407326

We drew on the noticing literature to examine leaders’ pedagogical reasoning as they discussed videocases of professional development. In this article, we demonstrate how changes in our framework for leader development and the resulting changes in the prompts and tasks shaped leader noticing in three ways: (a) accounting for the mathematical work of the facilitator and teachers in the videocase; (b) linking the mathematical work to goals for teacher learning; and (c) reasoning around the facilitator’s work in advancing those learning goals.

The principle research method is the pedagogical experiment with three control groups of students; the authors also applied the methods of systematization and generalization of the obtained data, expert assessment and interpretation of the study results, which helped to elaborate and test the scientific and methodological tools for assessing the development of students' managerial competence. The experiment involved 68 students of the Master's Degree program in Hospitality, 2040 assessments of competence levels were performed. Results: The paper reveals the essence of the methodology for assessing the development of managerial competences in university students taught with the use of case-technologies. The authors present their own rating scale for assessing the development of the managerial competences indicated in the professional standard for ""Head/Manager of hotel complex/hotel chain"" in Master's Degree students majoring in Hospitality. The results prove the effectiveness of using case-technologies for developing students' managerial competence, the effectiveness of different types of cases (creative, structured, and unstructured) is specified. The challenges of using case-technologies are identified, and recommendations for their use are suggested. The methodology for assessing the development of managerial competences in university students taught with the use of case-technologies elaborated by the authors can be used in educational programs in different fields of the Humanities. The difference of this methodology from the existing ones lies in its orientation at both the educational standards and the professional standards for heads of enterprises which emerged in Russia in the past 5 years. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been proved by high correlation of the research results obtained in different institutions and by different experts - University professors and employers. © Authors.","Case-technologies; Educational technology; Managerial competence; Professional standard; The level of competencies development",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034086937

Parallel to other continents, the introduction of LMS stimulated acceptance and adoption intentions among stakeholders in higher education. This necessitated research into faculty members' and students' LMS acceptance and adoption intentions. While some research has been conducted in this dimension, the evidential facts are scattered. There is a need to agglomerate these studies to project a better picture of study patterns and results, to be abreast of the current state of the literature and better direct future research. This study sought to bridge the gap by way of a systematic review of previous studies within a decade of LMS acceptance research in SSA, placing them in contextual paradigms of models, methodologies, milestones, subjects, countries, findings and challenges. Results from a systematic review of 31 studies, revealed key determinants of LMS acceptance/adoption to be Attitude and Perceived Usefulness; followed by Performance Expectancy and Perceived Ease of Use; then lastly Social Influence. Major challenges to LMS implementation identified were ICT infrastructure; LMS usage skills and training; LMS system quality, LMS use policy and management support. TAM1 was the dominant model employed and students were the main subject of studies. Moreover, quantitative approach was the preferred design with Regression as the main statistical tool used for data analysis. The study recommended among others that more UTAUT or TAM3 based studies employing mixed method design with instructors as subjects, using structural equation modelling analysis are needed in SSA LMS research. Leadership and top management of higher education institutions should focus more on ICT infrastructure, LMS usage skills/training, LMS quality related issues, support and ICT policy formulation. © Authors.","Acceptance; Adoption; E-learning; Higher education; Learning management system; Sub-Saharan Africa",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033784024

The study took place in a public primary school, located in a rural area of Cyprus. The majority of its students come from low socioeconomic status families. Among the school community, a group of 15 pupils (eight boys and seven girls), aged 10–11 years old, was randomly selected to comprise the sample. The same group of students was visited twice within a period of 2 years, and a teaching intervention was organized. In both interventions, the application A.L.E.X. accompanied by a student worksheet constituted the main means of instruction. The worksheets were designed to integrate a technology with core mathematical ideas embedded in the national mathematics curriculum. Findings gained from the teaching intervention suggest that game apps hold a lot of promise as a tool for reforming mathematics education. While working with A.L.E.X., the children identified and processed mathematical themes that emerged spontaneously. They experienced unique emotions of surprise and enthusiasm regarding the existence of games with mathematical content that led them to acknowledge the pedagogical role that tablet devices could play.

In order to promote continuity towards the introduction of geometry in primary school, we developed a long-term teaching experiment (with 15 sessions) carried out over 4 months in a first grade classroom in northern Italy. Students were asked to program a robot to move along paths, to pretend to act as robots and to represent the sequence of commands and the resulting paths. In particular, in this teaching experiment, an overarching mathematical aim was to sow the seeds for a mathematical definition of rectangles that includes squares. Within the paradigm of semiotic mediation, we intended to foster the students’ transition from a dynamic perception of paths to seeing paths also as static wholes, boundaries of figures with sets of geometric characteristics. The students’ situated productions were collected and analysed together with the specific actions of the adults involved, aimed at fostering processes of semiotic mediation.

Yet, little is known about appropriate design principles of CPD for teacher trainers/multipliers who in turn are supposed to provide CPD for teachers. The German Center for Mathematics Teacher Education (DZLM) offers special CPD courses for multipliers that focus on design principles identified as relevant for effective CPD of teachers in the research literature. The present study elaborates whether these principles can be transferred to CPD of multipliers and how in turn these principles are affected by them: Do they consider themselves more competent after a CPD course that followed the design principles of teacher CPD? What relevance do they assign to these CPD design principles derived from the literature and has the course design become relevant for their own work as CPD providers to teachers? Participants were 12 multipliers immersed in a 1-year CPD course. Data was gathered via questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data analyses were carried out. Our results reveal a significant improvement of self-estimated knowledge and skills in mathematics, mathematics pedagogy, CPD management, and technical skills between before and 6 or 10 months after the course. The multipliers’ descriptions of effective CPD focused on the design principles competence-orientation and participant-orientation. In sum, all design principles were rated as highly important for their own work as CPD providers although they were modified.

China, as a developing country with a long history and a unique culture, has the largest number of teachers and students in the world. Hence, it is of significance to explore the issue of the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on mathematics education within the Chinese context. However, investigations aiming to address this issue are relatively rare. This study was designed to examine the relationship between Chinese students’ SES and their mathematics achievements. Results reveal that Chinese students’ SES exerts significant influence on their mathematics achievements, and several important constituents of SES, such as parents’ education and family income, stand out among others. In this paper, the cultural causes of the influence are discussed, together with a general introduction to the social and educational context. These could partly explain the empirical results, along with factors such as the values of education in traditional Chinese culture and the current important status of mathematics in modern society as well as Chinese school curriculum materials’ effect on students’ mathematics achievements. The economic and social situation in China, especially the imbalanced distribution of educational resources between and within the urban and rural areas, could magnify the role of SES in mathematics achievements. Finally, the future direction of measuring and interpreting the SES’s influence on mathematics achievement in the Chinese context is also discussed. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Chinese culture; Mathematics achievement; Socio-economic status",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919917736

The present study aims to determine the misconceptions of pre-service physics teachers (n=117), pre-service science teachers (n=97) and in-service physics teachers (n=174) about astronomy concepts using a three-tier test. The Astronomy Concept and Achievement Test (ACAT), developed by Trumper (2001a, 2001b, 2006), was adapted as a three-tier instrument and used as the data collection instrument. The first tier, first and second tier and all three tier responses that were obtained from the ACAT were analyzed separately to identify misconceptions and to evaluate the respondents achievement. The results showed that the achievement scores of pre-service and in-service teachers considerably decreased when the third tier was considered. In addition, when the misconceptions of pre-service and in-service teachers were determined using all three tiers, they held extensive misconceptions especially about the reasons for seasons, the Moons phases, the Moons phase in the solar eclipse and the Suns position in the sky. © 2014 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","Astronomy concepts; Misconceptions; Pre- and in-service teachers; Three-tier test",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935416085

The purpose is to outline the link between online processes (revealed by eye fixation indices) and off-line outcomes in these learners. In science education, unlike a standard text, a refutation text acknowledges readers' alternative conceptions about a topic, refutes them, and presents scientific conceptions as viable alternatives. Lower and higher memory span university students with alternative conceptions about the topic read either a refutation or a non-refutation text about tides. Off-line measures of learning revealed that both groups of refutation text readers attained higher knowledge gains. During the reading process, refutation text readers fixated for longer on the refutation segments while reading the parts presenting the scientific information (look-froms). Non-refutation text readers looked back to the informational parts for longer. Look-froms (positively) and reading time (negatively) predicted learning from refutation text, indicating that the quality, not quantity, of reading was related to it. In contrast, learning from non-refutation text was predicted only by working memory capacity.

Surveyed mathematicians (N = 118) agreed to a great extent with the interviewed mathematicians in the exploratory studies. First, the mathematicians reported that they commonly read published proofs to gain different types of insight, not to check the correctness of the proofs. Second, they stated that when reading these proofs, they commonly: (a) appeal to the reputation of the author and the journal, (b) study how certain steps in the proof apply to specific examples, and (c) focus on the overarching ideas and methods in the proofs. In this paper, we also report findings from another section of the survey that focused on how participants reviewed proofs submitted for publication.

This study reported how 16 mathematics majors, including eight specializing in secondary mathematics education, who had completed more proof-based courses than transition-to-proof classes evaluated various arguments. The results suggest that the students use one of the following strategies in proof and counterexample validation: (1) examination of the argument's structure and (2) line-by-line checking with informal deductive reasoning, example-based reasoning, experience-based reasoning, and informal deductive and example-based reasoning. Most students tended to examine all steps of the argument with informal deductive reasoning across various tasks, suggesting that this approach might be problem dependent. Even though all participating students had taken more proof-related mathematics courses, it is surprising that many of them did not recognize global-structure or line-by-line content-based flaws presented in the argument. © 2012.","Algebra; Analysis; Geometry; Mathematics majors; Number theory; Proof and counterexample validation; Secondary mathematics education majors",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869209416

Three experiments, aimed at diagnosing rules of choice and designed without confounding possible rules with each other, were conducted. The level of arithmetic difficulty of the trials was controlled so as not to distort the effects of the constituent variables of proportion. Children aged 4 to 11 first chose by more winning elements and proceeded with age to choices by greater proportion of winning elements. There were some indications of intermediate choices by fewer losing elements and by greater difference between the two colours. Distinguishing correct choices from favourable draws, namely acknowledging the role of chance in producing the outcome and insisting on the right choice, grew with age. Children switched rather early from considering one dimension to two; they combined the quantities of winning and losing elements either additively by difference or, with age, mostly multiplicatively by proportion.

Earlier research suggested that although intuitions are often needed to gain new ideas and concepts and to solve problems in science and mathematics, some of students' difficulties could stem from the interference of intuitive reasoning. The literature suggests that overcoming intuitive interference is associated with the activation of inhibitory control mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to find out whether indeed the reasoning processes associated with overcoming intuitive interference are different from the ones related to answering correctly in line with the intuition. To do so, we focused on the comparison-of-perimeters of geometrical shapes task that triggers intuitive responses and applied the prime-probe paradigm. High school students were presented with pairs of congruent and incongruent trials of different combinations. The findings showed that previous trial congruity affects response times of the probe. When congruent trials followed incongruent prime, an increase in response time was observed as compared with congruent trials that followed congruent ones, and vice versa. In addition, when congruent trials followed incongruent-equal prime, not only did response time increase but accuracy significantly dropped as well. The current study supports the suggestion that inhibitory control mechanisms play a key role in overcoming intuitive interference, even in adolescence, and points to the importance of enhancing students' inhibitory control mechanisms. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan.","comparison-of-perimeters; executive functions; inhibitory control mechanisms; intuitive interference; intuitive reasoning",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864291872

This paper documents Australia's journey over the past 200 years, as we prepare for the implementation of our first truly Australian National Curriculum. One of the unique aspects of this curriculum is the emphasis on practical work and inquiry-based learning. This paper identifies seven forms of practical work currently used in Australian schools and the purposes aligned with each form by 138 pre-service and experienced in-service teachers. The paper explores the question 'What does the impending national curriculum, with its emphasis on practical inquiry mean to the teachers now - are they ready?' The study suggests that practical work in Australian schools is multifaceted, and the teacher-aligned purposes are dependent not only upon the age of the student, but also on the type of practical work being undertaken. It was found that most teachers are not ready to teach using inquiry-based pedagogy and cite lack of content knowledge, behaviour management, lack of physical resources and availability of classroom space as key issues which will hinder their implementation of the inquiry component of Australia's pending curriculum in science. © 2012 by ESER.","Australian curriculum; Inquiry-based pedagogy; Practical work; Science; Science inquiry skills",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862634844

In the first two experiments 91 secondary school students (ranging in age from 12.5 to 14.5 years) were asked to indicate numbers that could or could not be used to substitute literal symbols in algebraic expressions. The results showed that there was a strong tendency on the part of the students to interpret literal symbols to stand for natural numbers and a related tendency to consider the phenomenal sign of the algebraic expressions as their ""real"" sign.

We argue that cognition is both embodied and situated in the activities through which it occurs and that mathematics learning involves the appropriation of practices associated with the sets of artefacts that have historically come to represent the body of knowledge we call mathematics. This process of appropriation involves a coordination of a variety of the semiotic resources-spoken and written languages, mathematical representation systems, drawings, gestures and the like-through which mathematical objects and relationships might be experienced and expressed. To highlight the connections between perceptual activities and cultural concepts in the meanings associated with this process, we concentrate on learners who do not have access to the visual field. More specifically, we present three examples of gesture use in the practices of blind mathematics students-all involving the exploration of geometrical objects and relationships. On the basis of our analysis of these examples, we argue that gestures are illustrative of imagined reenactions of previously experienced activities and that they emerge in instructional situations as embodied abstractions, serving a central role in the sense-making practices associated with the appropriation of mathematical meanings. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abstraction; Blind mathematics learners; Embodied cognition; Gestures; Mediation",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956317606

The focus of this article is children's understandings of length at this early stage. 32 children aged 4-6 years at an Australian primary school were asked to draw a ruler and describe their drawing, once in February at the beginning of school, and again in November towards the end of their first year of school. The drawings and their accompanying descriptions are classified within a matrix which, informed by Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory and literature regarding the development of length concepts, considers conceptual understanding and contextual richness. The responses revealed that children have a good understanding of length at the start of school, but that as their ability to contextualise develops so too does their conceptual understanding. This article suggests that participation in tasks such as these allows children to create their own understandings of length in meaningful ways. Additionally, the task and its matrix of analysis provide an assessment strategy for identifying children's understandings about length and the contexts in which these understandings develop. © 2011 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Context; Measurement; Representations; Young children",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959291038

Content validity was determined through the expertise of a panel of five science educators. Sixty six preservice teachers enrolled in elementary science methods at three universities prepared lesson plans, which were scored by their instructors using the ILP rubric. Using a Pearson two-tailed correlation, inter-rater reliability was established at a value of 0.83. An exploratory factor analysis provided evidence of construct validity, with three factors. The factors included (1) explore, (2) engage/explain/elaborate, and (3) evaluate. In addition, a secondary analysis revealed the means and standard deviations of the students' performance on each of the phases of the 5E that include: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate. The engage item held the highest mean rating, and the evaluation items had the lowest mean ratings.

The analyses of lesson instruction were further supplemented with the analyses of teaching materials and interviews with the teacher. The findings go beyond previous studies that mainly focused on a single lesson to provide further evidence about Chinese teachers' instructional practices and their possible impact on students' learning.

It became much easier for students who were not fond of algebraic representations to work with concepts such as function using graphs or tables. Research on how students use such software showed that they shaped the tools to their own needs, resulting in an intershaping relationship in which tools shape the way students know at the same time the students shape the tools and influence the design of the next generation of tools. This kind of research led to the theoretical perspective presented in this paper: knowledge is constructed by collectives of humans-with-media. In this paper, I will discuss how media have shaped the notions of problem and knowledge, and a parallel will be developed between the way that software has brought new possibilities to mathematics education and the changes that the Internet may bring to mathematics education.

Such an international assessment would likely exert a profound impact on the science education policies of the participating countries/regions, including Hong Kong. This paper sets out to examine critically how scientific literacy has been assessed by PISA through analyzing its assessment frameworks and released sample items. It was found that the PISA 2000 and 2003 assessments of science have used a narrower definition of scientific literacy, as compared to that of PISA 2006 and what scientific literacy was construed for science education. However, even PISA 2006 appears to be more valid in its assessment framework, its validity was also called into question when the sample items for the trial study were examined. Knowledge about science was found largely about the processes of science, rather than the nature of science as described in the assessment framework. Besides, it intertwined with knowledge of science in a hidden manner. The application of knowledge of science in novel, real-life situations was also jeopardized because of the issue of curricular relevance. Besides these major problems, the article has discussed the problems with the concept of scientifically investigable questions and identifying research question of an investigation. Overall, the findings raised concern over what the PISA's measure of scientific literacy actually means. © National Science Council, Taiwan (2009).","International assessment of science education; Nature of science; PISA; Scientific literacy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70549090053

A videotaped episode was shown to 26 teachers gathered in five focus groups. In the episode, a teacher allows a student doing a proof to assume a statement is true without immediately justifying it, provided he return to complete the argument later. Prompted by this episode, the teachers in our focus groups revealed two apparently contradictory dispositions regarding the use of the two-column proof form in the classroom. For some, the two-column form is understood to prohibit a move like that shown in the video. But for others, the form is seen as a resource enabling such a move. These contradictory responses are warranted in competing but complementary notions, grounded on the corpus of teacher responses, that teachers hold about the nature of authentic mathematical activity when proving.","Authentic mathematics; Geometry; Proof; Teacher; Teaching",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349110080

Yet, little research has focused on how proof is promoted in mathematics curriculum materials and, more specifically, on the guidance that curriculum materials offer to teachers to enact the proof opportunities designed in the curriculum. This paper presents an analytic approach that can be used in the examination of the guidance curriculum materials offer to teachers to implement in their classrooms the proof opportunities designed in the curriculum.

The teacher introduced regression using dynamic graphs on Java applets. The approach seemed conducive to understanding. Graphics calculators, which all students owned, were used infrequently for investigating properties and were never used to introduce new constructs - one reason was that the static graphs on the calculators did not support inference of basic statistical relationships well. However, substantial time was given to developing competence with operating the calculators, which was necessary for success in public examinations.

Beginning with a brief sketch of the principal ideas used in the study of rhetoric, it argues that such a perspective provides a useful insight into the aims and purposes of the science teacher, arguing that science teachers are, in essence, engaged in a process of rhetorical argument. Likewise, a rhetorical characterization of the practice of science itself shows that argument is one of its central features. Therefore, if developing epistemic goals and an understanding about science within science education is important, the consideration of argument and reasoning should be a core feature of the practice of science education. A number of problems are identified with such change, including a shortage of suitable pedagogic materials and the lack of experience of science teachers in the use of deliberative discussion. More fundamentally, it is suggested that there is an inherent contradiction between the ‘rhetoric of conclusions’ practised by science teachers and the ‘rhetoric of dialogical argument’ practised by scientists. The resolution of this contradiction can be achieved only by a radical disjuncture in the nature and form of contemporary science education. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011514401

This paper aims to review the empirical evidence on the application of robotics in mathematics education and to define future research perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education. After a systematic search in online database via keyword search and snowballing approach, we analyzed 20 empirical studies on how to teach and learn mathematical knowledge through robotics. The results indicate that (1) most studies were conducted with a small sample size, the largest research groups were elementary school students and secondary school students, most studies used LEGO robots, robots were primarily applied to teach and/or learn graphics, geometry, and algebra, and almost half of the studies taught mathematics by engaging students in game-like interactions with robots; (2) half of the studies adopted a non-experimental research design, and most studies evaluated student performance through observation, test/examination, questionnaires, or verbal interviews; and (3) instructional implications proposed in the 20 papers can be clustered into four themes: human-robot interaction, connections between mathematics and real life, pedagogical suggestions, and facility conditions. The 20 papers suggest that robotics generally plays an active role in mathematics education; however, there are indeed situations in which no significant improvement was found in students’ mathematical learning. In view of this, we prospect the future research perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education and propose that more rigorous intervention studies could be conducted to further explore the integration of robotics and mathematics education. © 2018, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Educational robotics; Mathematics education; Teaching/learning strategies; Transdisciplinary issues",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056746910

They were also given the British Abilities Scales Basic Number Skills test. Attitudes were generally positive, though not more so than previously found for older primary school children. The Chinese children performed better in the arithmetic test and also rated themselves higher than the English children, but did not differ in other attitudes. Self-rating in mathematics and lack of unhappiness at poor performance were associated with better performance in the English group.

I illustrate the analysis of a text of a student group work in order to inform the discussion. The approach to data analysis seeks out tensions between potentially realizable and actual meaning in the immediacy of situations embedded in cultures of school mathematics and the official language of instruction. In the midst of social and personal relationships and diverse experiences in/of the world, language is a shifting resource for the communication of tensions regarding languages of learners and the creation of newer situations toward the production of meaning taken as mathematical and shared. © 2018, The Author(s).","Culture; Discourse; Language; Language as resource; Mathematics learning; Meaning potential",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044453707

This paper discusses to what extent modelling processes using digital tools can be described theoretically, and surveys significant empirical findings in this field. Based on a quantitative control study with 709 students, we especially investigated the competence of mathematising. We compared the competence development of a test-group that worked with digital tools, to a control-group that worked with paper and pencil on the same tasks during a four-lesson intervention on geometric modelling tasks. We find a comparable improvement of mathematising in both groups. This competence development was also investigated in relation to the influence of attitudes towards the software used and program-related self-efficacy. We find programrelated self-efficacy, but not attitudes towards the used software, to be a significant predictor of the gain in competency.

Teachers (N = 90) completed the Teacher Content Knowledge Survey (TCKS), which consisted of items measuring different cognitive types of teacher knowledge. The first cognitive type (T1) assessed participants’ knowledge of basic facts and procedures. The second cognitive type (T2) measured teachers’ understanding of concepts and connections. The third cognitive type (T3) gauged teachers’ knowledge of mathematical models and generalizations. The study comprised two levels of quantitative data analysis. First, we explored each cognitive type of teachers’ content knowledge and the overall TCKS score as they related to student performance. Second, we studied the correlation between each cognitive type of teacher content knowledge to deepen the understanding of content associations. Results of the study show a statistically significant correlation between cognitive types T1 and T2 of teacher content knowledge and student performance (p < .05). The correlation between cognitive type T3 and student performance was not significant (p = .0678). The most substantial finding was the correlation between teachers’ total score on the TCKS and student performance (Pearson’s r = .2903, p = .0055 < .01).

The different theoretical perspectives we used for analysing group work and for analysing whole class discussions, and the empirical data, led us to hypothesize links between shifts of knowledge and students’ creative reasoning. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to investigate creative reasoning within the shifts of knowledge in an inquiry-based classroom. Specifically, we ask: What is the role of creative mathematical reasoning in the shifts of knowledge between the knowledge agents and their followers in the classroom? To this end, we analysed a whole class discussion and the subsequent work of a small group. Our findings show that creative reasoning has a role in researchers’ characterization of shifts of knowledge in the classroom.

This study explores how LS improves teaching that promotes students’ understanding. A LS group including didacticians (practice-based teaching research specialist and University-based mathematics educators) and mathematics teachers in China explored and documented how teacher participants shifted their attention to students’ learning by incorporating two notions of teaching: learning trajectory (LT) and variation pedagogy (VP). The former describes conjectured routes of children’s thinking and learning with pertinent tasks to move towards the learning goals along the route, while the latter suggests strategies for using systematic tasks progressively. The concepts of LT and VP are used to guide planning, teaching, and debriefing throughout the LS process. Data consist of lesson plans, videotaped lessons, post-lesson discussions, post-lesson quizzes, and teachers’ reflection reports. This study reveals that by building on the learning trajectory and by strategically using variation tasks, the lesson has been improved in terms of students’ understanding, proficiency, and mathematical reasoning. In addition, the LT was refined through the LS. This study displays how theory-driven LS could help teachers improve their teaching and develop the linkage between theory and practice. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Learning trajectory; Lesson study; Theory-driven lesson study; Variation pedagogy",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976339953

However, numerical symbols necessitate an understanding of both order and magnitude, therefore order likely also plays a role in learning about number. Here, we used an artificial symbol-learning paradigm to contrast learning approximate numerical magnitude with learning numerical order. Thirty-two adult participants were randomly assigned to either the magnitude training group, in which they were trained to associate novel abstract symbols with non-symbolic numerical magnitudes, or the order training group, in which they were taught the ordinal sequence of the symbols, in analogy to the count sequence. Subsequently, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded while participants completed a magnitude comparison task with the newly learned symbols. Comparing these newly acquired symbols affected event related potentials (ERPs) in a way that resembled comparisons of real numerical symbols [e.g. Temple & Posner, (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95(13):7836–7841, 1998)]. Furthermore, these ERP effects did not differ across learning groups, suggesting that adults formed similar representations regardless of method of instruction.

The study used a convergent mixed methods design, in which quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently to answer the research questions (Creswell and Plano Clark 2011). Videos were used to capture each child’s interactions with the virtual manipulative mathematics apps, document learning performance and efficiency, and record children’s interactions with the affordances within the apps. Quantitized video data answered the research question on differences in children’s learning performance and efficiency between pre- and post-assessments. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test was used to explore these data. Qualitative video data was used to identify affordance access by children when using each app, identifying 95 potential helping and hindering affordances among the 18 apps. The results showed that there were changes in children’s learning performance and efficiency when children accessed a helping or a hindering affordance. Helping affordances were more likely to be accessed by children who progressed between the pre- and post-assessments, and the same affordances had helping and hindering effects for different children.

Also In mathematics, creativity or thinking creatively is important to be developed because creativity is an integral part of mathematics. However, limiting the use of creativity in the classroom reduces mathematics to a set of skills to master and rules to memorize. Doing so causes many children's natural curiosity and enthusiasm for mathematics to disappear as they get older, creating a tremendous problem for mathematics educators who are trying to instill these very qualities. To investigate the increase in awareness of elementary school students' creativity in solving math' problems by using the task like PISA's Question, a qualitative research emphasizing on the holistic description was conducted. We used a formative evaluation type of development research as a mean to develop mathematical tasks like PISA's question that have the potential effect to support students' creativity in mathematics.

Constructivist Learning Environment Survey and Science Motivation Questionnaire were administered to 243 elementary school students. The hypothesized model for students' motivation to learn science in their perceived learning environment was tested via LISREL. The results revealed that the students were negatively motivated to learn science in more constructivist learning environment. On the other hand, the findings indicated that the students were more motivated to learn science when they had more opportunities in relating science with the real world issues.

The pupils were exposed to the use of selected heuristic strategies in mathematical problem solving for a period of 16 months. This was done through solving problems where the solution was the most efficient if heuristic strategies were used. The authors conducted a two-dimensional classification of the use of heuristic strategies based on the work of Pólya (2004) and Schoenfeld (1985). We developed a tool that allows for the description of a pupil’s ability to solve problems. Named, the Culture of Problem Solving (CPS), this tool consists of four components: intelligence, text comprehension, creativity and the ability to use existing knowledge. The pupils’ success rate in problem solving and the changes in some of the CPS factors pre- and post-experiment were monitored. The pupils appeared to considerably improve in the creativity component. In addition, the results indicate a positive change in the students’ attitude to problem solving. As far as the teachers participating in the experiment are concerned, a significant change was in their teaching style to a more constructivist, inquiry-based approach, as well as their willingness to accept a student’s non-standard approach to solving a problem. Another important outcome of the research was the identification of the heuristic strategies that can be taught via long-term guided solutions of suitable problems and those that cannot. Those that can be taught include systematic experimentation, guess–check–revise and introduction of an auxiliary element. Those that cannot be taught (or can only be taught with difficulty) include the strategies of specification and generalization and analogy. © 2015, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Creativity; Culture of problem solving; Heuristic strategies; Intelligence; Problem solving",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948460075

Here, we focus on a comparison of perimeters task, in which the area is the irrelevant salient variable. In congruent trials (no interference), accuracy is higher and reaction time is shorter than in incongruent trials (area variable interference). A brain-imaging study related to this task indicated that correctly answering the incongruent condition is associated with activation in prefrontal brain regions known for their executive inhibitory control. These findings suggested that intervention aimed at activating inhibitory control mechanisms could improve students’ success. In this paper, we explore the effect of an intervention that explicitly warns about the possible interference of the variable area. Eighty-four sixth graders performed the same comparison of perimeters reaction time test, with warning intervention (warning group) or without it (control group). Accuracy in the warning group was significantly higher in incongruent conditions and reaction time was significantly longer in all conditions than in the control group. The results suggest that the explicit warning activates inhibitory control mechanisms and thus helps students overcome the interference. The findings point to the possibility of improving students’ problem-solving abilities through simple and focused interventions that explicitly warn them about the trap in the task. Such research-based simple interventions appear to require only teachers’ knowledge and awareness and could complement the traditional educational technique of supporting relevant content knowledge. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Comparison of perimeters; Congruity; Inhibitory control mechanisms; Intuitive interference; Reaction time; Warning intervention",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940050719

Many different theories have been set out as to why these declines in mathematical competency levels have occurred over time. One such theory is the widening access to higher education which has resulted in a less mathematically prepared profile of beginning undergraduates than ever before. In response to this situation, the present study details the examination of a range of methods through which a student's mathematical performance in higher education could be predicted at the beginning of their third-level studies. Several statistical prediction methods were examined and the most effective method in predicting students' mathematical performance was discriminant analysis. The discriminant analysis correctly classified 71.3% of students in terms of mathematics performance. An ability to carry out such a prediction in turn allows for appropriate mathematics remediation to be offered to students predicted to fail third-level mathematics. The results of the prediction of mathematical performance, which was carried out using a database consisting of over 1000 beginning undergraduates over a 3-year period, are detailed in this article along with the implications of such findings to educational policy and practice. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","changing profile; declining standards; mathematics problem; predicting performance; remediation; widening access",,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901352828

We develop a theoretical model of metacognition in collaborative problem solving based on models and modeling perspectives. The theoretical model addresses several challenges previously found in the research of metacognition. This paper illustrates how metacognition was elicited, at the environmental level, through problems requiring different problem-solving processes (definition building and operationalizing definitions), and how metacognition operated at both the individual level and the social level during complex problem solving. The re-conceptualization of metacognition has the potential to guide the development of metacognitive activities and effective instructional methods to integrate them into existing curricula that are necessary to engage students in active, higher-order learning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..","Definition building; Metacognition; Model-eliciting activities; Operationalizing definitions",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879584878

Sixty third-graders of three different mathematical achievement levels individually solved a series of 2-digit additions and subtractions in one choice and two no-choice conditions. In the choice condition, children could choose between the compensation (56? 29 =?; 56? 30 = 86, 86 - 1 = 85) and jump strategy (56? 29 =?; 56? 20 = 76, 76? 9 = 85) on each item. In the two nochoice conditions, children had to solve each item with either the compensation or the jump strategy. The results demonstrated that children of all achievement levels spontaneously applied both the compensation and the jump strategy to solve the items from the choice condition.

Participants were encouraged during a guided imagery session to construct mental images for a scenario written about the explanation of the reaction of sodium in water. They were then asked to describe what they envisioned in their own imagination. Participants had images that were based on textbook illustrations, modeling kits, a solar-system model, physical properties, and humanized animations. 3D mental images represented 33.36% of participants' mental images at the microscopic level, while images in 2D format formed 39.15% of the overall created mental images. Several factors shaped the participants' mental images, such as their imaginative ability, attention mode, and the nature of their old images stored in their long-term memory. Most of the participants experienced image transformation from one form to another as they were progressing in the GI session. This unstable reliance on different models might indicate unorganized conceptual networks in learners' LTM: a feature that characterizes novices' mental networking. On the contrary, past research has revealed that experts have more organized and sophisticated conceptual networking. This study argued that participants lacked the homogeneous and reliable mental model of the atom that is required to carry out advanced cognitive processes for mental exploration of chemical phenomena. The absence of this mental model might explain the overwhelming finding in literature that many learners fail to explain and predict chemical phenomena. © National Science Council, Taiwan (2009).","Chemistry teaching; Guided imagery; Imagination; Mental images; Particulate level of matter; Science education",,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70549094234

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) including computer hardware/software, networking and other technologies such as audio, video, and other multimedia tools became learning tools for students in the 21 st century. ICT also changed the nature of the teachers' work and the way they relate to other teachers in their professional lives. The researcher designed and implemented a course to enhance 18 pre-service science teachers' professional knowledge, which knowledge of instructional media and technology is one of the important domains. Technology was used as a tool for enhancing the development of professional knowledge in a seminar organizing activity in which students designed instructional movies and participated in online discussion activities. Data from questionnaires, classroom observation, journals, online discussion boards, and pre-service science teachers' artifacts were analyzed by the constant comparative method. The results revealed that most of the pre-service science teachers felt more comfortable using software and hardware, were willing to learn, improve their creativity, participate in group collaboration, and felt free asking questions and reflecting on their ideas on discussion boards. The results show that pre-service science teachers develop their professional knowledge when they are engaged in embedding ICT in subject teaching activities.

Almost all researchers may agree on a formal definition of mathematical proof. But beyond this minimal agreement, what is the state of our field? After three decades of activity in this area, being familiar with the most influential pieces of work, I realize that the sharing of keywords hides important differences in the understanding. These differences could be obstacles to scientific progress in this area, if they are not made explicit and addressed as such. In this essay I take a sample of research projects which have impacted the teaching and learning of mathematical proof, in order to describe where the gaps are. Then I suggest a possible scientific programme which aspires to strengthen the research practice in this domain. Eventually, I make the additional claim that this programme could hold for other areas of research in mathematics education. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.",,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951770135

In these studies, we have attempted to involve a variety of representations and to build students' abilities to switch between them (in line with the theories of Dreyfus in Advanced mathematical thinking. Kluwer, Dordtrecht, pp. 25-41, 1991, and Duval in Proceedings of the 21st conference of the North American chapter of the international group for the psychology of mathematics education, vol. 1, pp. 3-26, 1999). The studies have shown the negative effect of closure on generalisation in symbolic representations, the predominance of single variance generalisation over covariant generalisation in tabular representations, and the reduced ability to readily identify commonalities and relationships in enactive and iconic representations. This presentation will use a variety of studies to explore the interrelation between verbal and visual comprehension of context and generalisation. The studies showed in a variety of contexts the importance of understanding and communicating aspects of representational forms which allowed commonalities to be seen across or between representations. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2007.",,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649281609

Our data are drawn from students’ engagement with two well-known paradoxes - Hilbert’s Grand Hotel and the Ping-Pong Ball Conundrum - before, during, and after instruction. While graduate students found the resolution of Hilbert’s Grand Hotel paradox unproblematic, responses of students in both groups to the Ping-Pong Ball Conundrum were surprisingly similar. Consistent with prior research, the work of participants in our study revealed that they perceive infinity as an ongoing process, rather than a completed one, and fail to notice conflicting ideas. Our contribution is in describing specific challenging features of these paradoxes that might influence students’ understanding of infinity, as well as the persuasive factors in students’ reasoning, that have not been unveiled by other means. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
