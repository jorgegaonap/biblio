This article shows how the emergent models heuristic (Gravemeijer, 1999, Math. Think. Learn, 1, 155-177) provides this opportunity to first-year university students, specifically for them to construct the Linear Algebra concepts of spanning set and span. For this, a design-based research methodology was used. A hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT) was applied, created within the framework of this heuristic. The results provide evidence that the emergent models heuristic support the construction of these concepts of Linear Algebra. Moreover, useful tips are given for using this heuristic to construct mathematical concepts. © The Author 2017.

Eight different strategies were identified, some of which used fantasy money as a representation system that helped students to decompose quantities. They referred to strategies used by people, without schooling, when they receiving money back after paying for a purchase in the market. Strategies such as removing one to the minuend in a subtraction with regrouping also appeared, to obtain one addition without regrouping.

The analysis clearly shows certain achievements of the constructivist approach applied, and also some limitations on the learning levels. Although students prepare some answers with a degree of autonomy, their justifications are based on aspects of common statistical content knowledge without actually applying more advanced thinking, required by the problem posed. This suggests that the constructivist didactic approach should be complemented with moments of knowledge transmission to overcome blocking situations generated by the lack of previous knowledge. © 2018 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

Specifically, difficulties associated to the mathematical process development, comparison and training of procedures (MEN, 1998). At first, we analyzed a diagnostic test of a pre-calculus course in which newly enrolled university students participated. It was found that students have difficulties to establish relationships and differences between different notations of real numbers and to decide on their use in a given situation. Further, the difficulties of using the representations and recognizing the effect of using one representation or another in the resolution of the problem were evident. The identification and characterization of these difficulties may allow to calculus teachers to take important decisions about their didactic planning. © 2018 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

The way to teach the fundamental concepts following its application through guided semester works is explained. To do so each student sets a medium to long-term goal by stablishing a five-stage plan to achieve it: stage 1 corresponds to investment in fixed income, stages 2 and 3 corresponds to variable income, the concept of risk is analyzed in stage 4 through the proper management of investment portfolios, and stage 5 is a free choice investment. The results at the end of the course show that approximately 70% of students get the goal within the deadline, highlighting that the most important part is the reflection of the causes of success or failure in getting the goal. In general, there is a change in attitude toward the management of personal finance.

Para lograrlo, cada estudiante plantea una meta de mediano a largo plazo estableciendo un plan de cinco etapas para alcanzarla: la etapa 1 corresponde a inversión en renta fija, en las etapas 2 y 3 se invierte en renta variable, en la etapa 4 se analiza el concepto de riesgo mediante el manejo adecuado de portafolios de inversión y en la etapa 5 se hace una inversión de libre elección. Los resultados al final del curso muestran que aproximadamente el 70% de los estudiantes logran llegar a la meta en el plazo establecido, resaltando que lo más importante en todos los casos es la reflexión de las causas del éxito o el fracaso. En general se nota un cambio de actitud hacia el manejo de las finanzas personales. Esto lo muestra una encuesta practicada al comienzo y al final del curso que indica que la proporción de estudiantes con alta probabilidad de lograr la seguridad financiera pasa del 25% al 76%. © 2018 Formación Universitaria.","Análisis de riesgo; Finanzas personales; Guided semester work; Inversión; Investment; Personal finance; Risk analysis; Trabajo semestral guiado",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059611588

A general low achievement level in the test tasks was observed, with the best overall achievement level in the tasks related to proportionality and correlation schemes, and the worst achievement level in the tasks related with the use of probabilities. There are significant differences depending on the educational level to which the students belong, and an evolutionary pattern is observed in their scores.

The results showed that students, in general, assigned different meanings to the limit, which emerged from their concept-image and showed an adequate conception of the symbols present on the formal limit definition. They were also able to recognize and represent the limit, both algebraic and geometrically with records based on the symbols of this definition and to apply it correctly in the errors analysis and when solving problems involving conjecture validation.

Drawing on this premise, we describe in this article the process by which linear algebra was initially introduced as a teaching content, before gaining the academic course status, into the undergraduate programs in mathematics and engineering at the University of São Paulo (USP). Particularly relevant to this process was the role played by French mathematicians, especially members of the Bourbaki Group, who taught at USP during the 1945-1966 period. In the mathematics program of USP's School of Philosophy, Sciences, and Languages, linear algebra was a teaching content on the Geometry Complements course from the early 1950s up until 1964. Only in 1965 was a course entitled Linear Algebra introduced into the program's curriculum. In the São Paulo Polytechnic School's Engineering Programs, however, linear algebra had been taught since 1961 as a full-fledged course called Elements of Linear Algebra and Analytical Geometry, renaming the course previously called Elements of Analytical and Projective Geometry, in which linear algebra had constituted a teaching content since 1958. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

It aims to analyze written and oral narratives produced by students from a Pedagogy program of a Brazilian Federal University. We take into account that the mathematical training of these students has started before the access to higher education. Thus, we consider it is important to understand this previous knowledge in order to contribute to these students' training process. During the narratives analysis, we built the following themes: general conception about mathematics; teacher posture; the use of mathematics in everyday practices; ways to deal with mathematical contents; mathematical content mostly quoted; and emphasis on literacy. In addition, we discuss in this paper specifics mathematics contents from Pedagogy programs. The discussions converge to the role of teacher trainer when she/he is faced with the lack of time to address contents and methodologies of mathematics education and with the difficulties brought by her/him students since their basic schooling. Considering a training perspective, we emphasize the care with microaggressions related to mathematics contents and the meaning production related to mathematics teaching and learning. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In order to do so, it was provided an education course based on the conception of Cybereducation with mathematics teachers (ROSA, 2015), which considers Digital Technologies (DT) in the context of Mathematics Education as participants in the knowledge production movement. In addition, regarding Mobile Cybereducation, this knowledge production movement is purposely raised in an informal manner through the smartphone, in line with social networks. In this sense, smartphones were made available for mobile access to these online platforms, while the participants were dispersed geographically. Under this bias, we understand the ""being/participant"" connected to a mobile device and this links us to the corporeity of these participants in the Merleau-Ponty (2011) perspective, pointing out as a result that teachers establish mathematical connections between peers hyper-textually plugged in a ubiquitously way.

Ten meta-analyses were conducted, five to examine the association of placement stability, race, mentoring, gender and education with employment outcomes; and five to examine the association of placement stability, race, mentoring, gender and maltreatment with education outcomes. A systematic literature search in five data bases (PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest and Web of Science) identified 12 publications with employment outcomes for youth out of care (N = 9392) and 12 publications with education outcomes (N = 6781). Being a girl and having a high school diploma were found to be related to higher odds of employment. However, no significant overall effects for employment outcomes were found for placement stability, race and mentoring. As regards to education outcomes, meta-analytic results indicated that placement stability is linked with a higher probability of having a high school diploma. The other meta-analyses pointed out the nonexistence of significant differences of educational level considering the variables race, gender, mentoring and type of maltreatment. This study indicated that placement instability in might be where the problem of achieving improvements in care leavers’ education and employability actually lies. Limitations, such as sample size and a bias regarding the origin of the studies included, should be considered in interpreting results.

However, nursing students generally have difficulties identifying nursing diagnoses accurately. Objective: To compare the diagnostic accuracy within and across the NANDA-I diagnoses domains of junior, senior, and graduate-entry students. Design: Descriptive study Participants and Setting: The sample comprised one hundred thirty nursing students from a Midwestern American university. Methods: The participants were divided in three groups (juniors, seniors and graduate-entry) and invited to engage in a series of diagnostic exercises presented in a software. Students were presented with 13 scenarios and asked to identify the applicable defining characteristics, related factors, and nursing diagnoses from the NANDA-I taxonomy. The number of correct answers per scenario was used to compute diagnostic accuracy. Age, gender, previous exposure to the NANDA-I taxonomy, and student level were covariates in the analysis. Results: The average percent correct answers across all groups was 64.4% and no statistical differences between the groups were found. The scenarios belonging to the Health Promotion, Self-Perception, and Growth/Development Domains were those in which students had a higher number of incorrect answers. Students also had more difficulty recognizing the correct nursing diagnoses compared with related factors and defining characteristics.

However, despite scientific advances, surgical patients continue to face risks. Among the most common complications in surgery are operations on the wrong patient, performance of the wrong procedure or operation on the wrong surgical site, lack of adequate or required equipment, failure to prevent blood loss, and surgical items left inside patients. In this context, the planning and development of innovative educational strategies is important for prevention of adverse events and the improvement of surgical patient safety culture. Objective: To describe the process of validating the content of mobile technology for education about surgical safety. Methods: Content validation using the Delphi technique was carried out from December 2015 to January 2016 at a Federal University in South Brazil. Content development and animations were produced by the authors from a verification list for safety surgery and a safety surgery protocol. Twelve judges assessed five variables (Content, Language, Illustration, Layout and Motivation), for consensus on content validation. They evaluated quality of each item, using a rating scale consisting of five levels (1 to 5). Results: Two assessment rounds were done, with a mean content validity index (CVI) of 0.95 and 1.0 and a kappa index of >0.83 and >0.92, respectively. The judges provided positive comments about each phase of the study, most of comments highlights were: choice of very relevant subject matter, excellent quality of the material and the motivation that the material can provide to the target audience. Conclusion: The study validated the content of learning technology by general consensus of judges with a high level of concordance among evaluated items. The application was considered adequate for educating students and health professionals about surgical safety. © 2018","delphi technique; health education; learning/educational technology; nursing education; patient safety; validation studies","adult; Brazil; Delphi study; education; female; health care personnel; health care quality; human; male; middle aged; mobile application; operating room; patient safety; persuasive communication; questionnaire; software validation; standards; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Brazil; Delphi Technique; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Operating Rooms; Patient Safety; Persuasive Communication; Quality of Health Care; Software Validation; Surveys and Questionnaires","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","To Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES), Ministry of Education of Brazil.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054196105

Students struggle to learn algebra, and teachers struggle to identify the best way to teach algebra. It is recurrent that teachers use instructional methods that promote memorization, and, consequently, the learning process may prove unsatisfactory. This paper introduces Virtual Algebra Tiles, an open educational resource whose purpose is to enable students to use algebra tiles from a computer to enhance their knowledge of algebra concepts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed a case study. The participants were 40 students of engineering degrees who were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Results indicate that the system has a large effect size (ES = 0.83, p < 0.001) on learning effectiveness and a promising long-term knowledge retention (ES = 0.79, p < 0.001). Students concluded that this version of algebra tiles is more motivating than other versions, because it is presented in a format that stands natural to them. Students feel more comfortable in virtual environments, and therefore, the learning process becomes a more pleasant task. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","algebra; algebra tiles; education; information technologies; open educational resource",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052624077

Gender differences regarding quality of life are associated with higher states of anxiety and depression among female physicians. We aimed to assess gender differences in the perception of quality of life with quantitative methods and to understand further, from the female residentś point of view, the reasons that may influence the perception of quality of life using qualitative method. Resilience, empathy and daytime sleepiness were also scored. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study with first-year internal medicine residents to evaluate self-reported quality of life factors specific to medical residents (VERAS-Q), including empathy (Jefferson Scale of Empathy), resilience (Wagnild and Young Brief Resilience Scale) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Scale). We explored, from the female residentś view which factors may influence the perception of quality of life using a focus group method. Results: In our study, one hundred and nine residents completed the survey: 31 (28.4%) were female and 78 (71.6%) were male. Female residents exhibited significantly lower scores than those of male residents for quality of life in the domains of time management (30.3, females vs 41.1, males; p < 0.001), psychology (48.1, females vs 56.7, males; p < 0.01) and physical health (42.8, females vs 53.6, males; p < 0.05). Female residents also scored higher for daytime sleepiness (13.0, females vs 9.0, males; p < 0.001), with pathological scores for daytime sleepiness. No significant gender differences were found in the resilience or empathy scores. The focus group assessment revealed difficulty in concentration and knowledge acquisition, insecurity, feelings of loss, greater critical perception, self-doubt and difficulty in creating effective bonds to support the training period as the main factors involved in the lower perception of quality of life among the women. Conclusions: In conclusion, female residents had lower scores for quality of life and higher scores for daytime sleepiness. Measures to improve quality of life among female residents during this critical period of medical training might include investing in mentoring to help them better manage their time and encouraging activities that facilitate relationship development. © 2018 The Author(s).","Daytime sleepiness; Empathy; Gender bias; Medical residency; Quality of life; Resilience","adult; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; education; emotional disorder; female; health personnel attitude; human; information processing; internal medicine; male; medical student; psychological resilience; psychology; qualitative research; quality of life; sex factor; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Affective Symptoms; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Internal Medicine; Male; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Resilience, Psychological; Sex Factors; Students, Medical; Young Adult","Universidade de São Paulo","This study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo.

There are a number of challenges that researchers might face when engaging in activist research with co-researchers. In that sense, researchers must be open to multiple perspectives and critical attitudes in order to negotiate the challenges that arise in the process. This paper describes the challenges that the lead author faced in learning to become an activist researcher in a socially vulnerable sport context and how these challenges were negotiated. The lead author, supervised by the second author, conducted a six month activist research study in a soccer program in a socially and economically disadvantaged neighborhood in Brazil. Participants included two researchers (lead and second authors), 17 young people, four coaches, a pedagogic coordinator and a social worker as co-researchers. Multiple sources of data were collected, including 38 field journal/observations and audio records of: 18 youth work sessions, 16 coaches’ work sessions, three combined coaches and youth work sessions, and 37 meetings between the lead author and the second author. By using an activist approach four challenges were identified and negotiated: learning to become more comfortable with an activist approach, helping young people to articulate what they know and the researcher to see what they say, valuing co-researchers’ knowledge, and negotiating the culture of sport. We argue that challenges are essential, necessary and significant in an activist research project in order to transform ourselves as researchers and our relationship with others. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Activist research; challenges; collaboration; critical pedagogy; empowerment; marginalized groups; participatory action research; Paulo Freire; social vulnerability","Brazil; empowerment; human; human experiment; information processing; interpersonal communication; juvenile; learning; neighborhood; pedagogics; scientist; soccer; social worker","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 1471193201739433","Carla Luguetti is sponsored by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient?fico e Tecnol?gico [National Council of Technological and Scientific Development]), Brazil [grant number 1471193201739433].","Carla Luguetti is sponsored by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [National Council of Technological and Scientific Development]), Brazil [grant number 1471193201739433].",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012050921

DSP courses are difficult to the students due to a high mathematical content and high level of abstraction, for this reason, the primary objective of this work is to create a pedagogical tool that allows the improvement on the teaching process in Signal Processing courses. There are two popular approaches: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) which have been used to find time-frequency maps. The student roll was designed for active participation by creating melodies from real instruments as well as synthetic generators, and by implementing the codes of STFT and CWT in MATLAB. The results demonstrate that in general terms, after carrying out these laboratory activities the students are more motivated to learn Signal Processing theory, and some of them become interested in the new research line on Music Information Retrieval (MIR), which would benefit the continuity of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technologies ABET, obtained for the Automation Engineering program at Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro (UAQ) since 2016. © 2018 The Authors.

Despite the advantages identified in the TBL literature, student perceptions must be better investigated using valid, reliable instruments. This study constructed and validated an instrument to evaluate student perceptions of the TBL method. Content and appearance assessment, construct validation and reliability analysis were performed. A total of 246 undergraduate nursing and medical students from a private institution in São Paulo, Brazil, participated in the study. After content validation, the instrument had 24 items distributed in five dimensions. Based on exploratory factor analysis, the instrument was appropriate, and the items were regrouped in four dimensions, with Cronbach's alpha values over 0.70. The Student Perception Evaluation of the TBL method (Avaliação da Percepção do Aluno-Team-Based Learning - APA-TBL) is an instrument with strong validity indicators. After validation, the revised instrument reflected that the student's perspective of method evaluation is not focused on TBL's formal execution but on the involved agents, their interaction and their influence on one another. © 2018","Active teaching methods; Education; Instrument validation; Team-based learning","article; Brazil; Cronbach alpha coefficient; exploratory factor analysis; human; learning; medical student; nursing; perception; teaching; validation process; validity; curriculum; evaluation study; female; group process; male; medical student; nursing student; problem based learning; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Brazil; Curriculum; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Male; Perception; Problem-Based Learning; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056194301

Methods: Undergraduate students completed the STAI-Trait/State and a questionnaire to assess their confidence level to perform each step of an emergency endodontic procedure. They also answered a numerical scale (NRS) for anxiety before and after emergency care. Ten randomly selected students from the same sample further participated in a focus group aimed at obtaining qualitative data on their perception of endodontic treatments’ conduction and the learning process necessary to perform them. Results: A total of 23 students joined the study. The majority of the participants reported feeling “confident” when performing local anaesthesia (57.6%), rubber dam placement (57.6%) and coronal sealing (72.7%). However, a small number reported feeling “little confident” to perform access cavity (15.2%) or pulpotomy/pulpectomy (24.2%). Students who scored above the 3rd quartile of STAI-Trait/State were classified as “highly anxious,” and comprised 26.1% of the sample. The values of NRS scale were higher in the preoperative when compared with the post-operative assessment. All students classified as “highly anxious” reported low confidence in performing “access cavity” and “pulpotomy/pulpectomy.”. Conclusion: Both quantitative and qualitative analysis showed different anxiety levels in dental students. It can possibly contribute to a reduction in confidence prior to emergency endodontic procedures. The current findings suggest it might be important to rearrange activities in order to allow for more practical classes in Endodontics. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methods: A total of 3568 dental students were recruited from 14 different dental schools. The dental environmental stress (DES) questionnaire was used including 7 domains. Responses to the DES were scored in 4-point Likert scale. Comparison between students was performed according to the study variables. The top 5 stress-provoking questions were identified amongst dental schools. Data were analysed using SPSS software program. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was also conducted to determine the effect of the studied variables on the stress domains. The level of statistical significance was set at <.05. Results: Internal consistency of the scale was excellent (0.927). Female students formed the majority of the total student population. The percentage of married students was 4.8%. Numbers of students in pre-clinical and clinical stages were close together. The most stress-provoking domain was “workload” with a score of 2.05 ± 0.56. Female students scored higher stress than male students did in most of the domains. Significant differences were found between participating countries in all stress-provoking domains. Dental students from Egypt scored the highest level of stress whilst dental students from Jordan scored the lowest level of stress. Conclusion: The self-reported stress in the dental environment is still high and the stressors seem to be comparable amongst the participating countries. Effective management programmes are needed to minimise dental environment stress. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

It requires continuing education and training under the tutelage of a clinic professor, who will guide the student to develop optimal potential. The objective of this study was to design and validate a tool to measure student perception on the learning quality of clinical rotations. Material and methods: The study is quantitative, observational, descriptive, prospective, and cross-sectional. The study sample was consisted of 148 fifth-year medical students from a private university in northern Mexico. A 30 item questionnaire was developed to assess quality of clinical stewardships in three variables: structure, tutoring, and teaching-learning process. A five-level Likert scale from 1, absolutely disagree, to 5, absolutely agree, was used. The study used item analysis to estimate internal consistency, as well as ANOVA, Tukey and descriptive statistics to assess the tendencies by factors and stewardship. Results: Cronbach alpha was 0.9549. The structure factor mean was 3.64, tutoring 4.03, and teaching-learning process 4.18. Paediatrics received the most favourable evaluation by obtaining a significant difference in the element structure (P =.008) and tutoring (P =.003). Discussion: Even though the mean observed among tutoring and teaching-learning process indicates an adequate level of student perception, under the analysis per field, a significant variation was found in the quality of learning experience. As an academic institution, this is a concern because students are not acquiring or developing the same level of skills in all stewardships. © 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Clinical fields; Clinical teaching; Quality of programs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031317477

By adapting elements of the theoretical and methodological framework called Abstraction in Context (AiC), participants’ discussions while building a mathematical model—in a nested epistemic actions—are analysed. Two specific points are discussed in this paper. The first aims to identify how different types of knowledge emerge when an individual is faced with a modelling task. The second is regarding the use of auxiliary material as a means of metaphorising a situation. It was evidenced how the material favours the construction of a mathematical model through the simplification and idealisation that it brings. The meaning constructed for the model is supported in recognising a decreasing behaviour as a part of a whole. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Abstraction in context; Auxiliary material; Interpreting; Mathematical knowledge building; Modelling",,"3150317; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1151093, PUCV DI 039.330/2016","This work was supported by CONICYT/FONDECYT/POSDOCTORADO/No.3150317.

Findings: Results showed that for students, the variable that most affects the establishment of a good relationship with their faculty is the “faculty’s knowledge,” while the variable that showed the least effect is the “number of students in the classroom.” On the other hand, faculty members responded that the variables that most affect the establishment of a good pedagogical relationship are “empathy with students,” “vocation” and “faculty’s knowledge,” while they considered that the least relevant variables were “context” variables such as “the number of students in the classroom” and “the physical conditions of the classroom.” Practical implications: These results provide relevant insights into the importance that students place on the theoretical resources that faculty members show as a foundation for establishing positive relationships. In the same way, the relevance that faculty members place on the elements “empathy,” “vocation” and “knowledge” as key variables needed to establish positive interactions. Originality/value: Previous research had underlined the importance that positive faculty-students relationships have on achieving learning goals. However, the variables that would affect the establishment of these relationships were not clearly recognized. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Faculty-student relationship; Higher education; Learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053052614

Teachers and members of the school management team are the grassroots public agents who translate and implement the public policies designed at the strategic level by the various governments. For Ideb, understanding how these subjects act and how they think is important in order to uncover how external evaluations have been processed in schools and what possible outcomes are produced there. The literature reveals that this indicator has promoted changes in daily school dynamics and at the level of education departments, often driven by accountability actions in a context of public policies of a managerial state. Sixteen interviews were conducted in eight public schools with the management team in the municipalities of Mariana, Ouro Preto, João Monlevade and Itabira (Minas Gerais). The analysis revealed that the external evaluations and Ideb have an inductive effect on the school, promoting the teachers' connection with the pedagogical project, increasing the number of pedagogical meetings and a concern with curricular planning. Interviews also revealed that such movements depend on the profile of school leaders. The involvement of the management teams is a central aspect for the professionals who work in them to commit to this process. On the other hand, the interviews showed that Ideb has become a regulatory instrument for educational evaluation policies, aimed at measuring results, which contributes to the generation of malaise between professionals and schools, revealing subtle and naturalized practices of accountability. © 2018, Arizona State University.

There is a disproportionately low number of biomedical and clinical researchers in LMIC's relative to their high burden of disease, a disparity that is aggravated by emigration of up to 70% of scientists from their countries of birth for education and employment elsewhere. To help address this need, a novel University-accredited, immersive fellowship program was established by a large public-academic-private network. We sought to describe the program and summarize progress and lessons learned over its first 7-years. Methods: Hallmarks of the program are a structured learning curriculum and bespoke research activities tailored to the needs of each fellow. Research projects expose the scientists to state-of-the-art methodologies and leading experts in their fields while also ensuring that learnings are implementable within their home infrastructure. Fellows run seminars on drug discovery and development that reinforce themes of scientific leadership and teamwork together with practical modules on addressing healthcare challenges within their local systems. Industry mentors achieve mutual learning to better understand healthcare needs in traditionally underserved settings. We evaluated the impact of the program through an online survey of participants and by assessing research output. Results: More than 140 scientists and clinicians from 25 countries participated over the 7-year period. Evaluation revealed strong evidence of knowledge and skills transfer, and beneficial self-reported impact on fellow's research output and career trajectories. Examples of program impact included completion of post-graduate qualifications; establishment and implementation of good laboratory- and clinical- practice mechanisms; and becoming lead investigators in local programs. There was a high retention of fellows in their home countries (> 75%) and an enduring professional network among the fellows and their mentors. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates an example for how multi-sectoral partners can contribute to scientific and professional development of researchers in LMICs and supports the idea that capacity-building efforts should be tailored to the specific needs of beneficiaries to be maximally effective. Lessons learned may be applied to the design and conduct of other programs to strengthen science ecosystems in LMICs. © 2018 The Author(s).","Capability development; Capacity development; Early career researcher development; Education; Fellowship; Postgraduate research; Public health; Research and Development","capacity building; curriculum; developing country; education; female; human; leadership; learning; male; medical education; mentor; personnel; supply and distribution; Capacity Building; Curriculum; Developing Countries; Fellowships and Scholarships; Female; Humans; Leadership; Learning; Male; Mentors; Research Personnel","World Health Organization, WHO; European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, EDCTP","Much has been written to acknowledge the secondary effects of strengthening research capacity on health in under-resourced environments.

Although Argentina stands out in relation to enrollment in higher education, it faces serious problems in terms of retention and graduation. To study the factors associated with dropout in the higher education system, we use the Permanent Household Survey, or EPH, to measure these phenomena. The EPH is a quarterly national survey that systematically and permanently collects data on the population’s demographic, educational, labor and socioeconomic characteristics. Based on the EPH, we calculated the global dropout and graduation rates by socioeconomic status and gender and used logistic regression models to estimate the effect of some demographic, socioeconomic, institutional and financial factors on dropout probability. Among the main findings, we observed that the socioeconomic status and being a first-generation student matter. We detected that being a first-generation student, even after controlling for the socioeconomic status of the student’s household, gender, the type of institution (tertiary non-university or university) and having a scholarship, implies a higher probability of dropout. We conclude that these results are most germane to public policy design and possible replications of this methodology in other Latin American countries. © 2018, Arizona State University.

Background: Medical education research requires the use of several different instruments with dozens of items that evaluate each construct separately, making their application slow and increasing the likelihood of students providing a large number of incomplete or missing responses. To provide an alternative measure, this study aims to translate, adapt, and validate the multidimensional ESWIM instrument for Brazilian medical students. This is a very promising instrument because it is multidimensional, relatively short, and cost free; it evaluates important constructs; and it has been explicitly designed for use in the medical context. Approach: The English-language instrument was translated and adapted into the Brazilian Portuguese language using standard procedures: translation, transcultural adaptation, and back-translation. ESWIM was administered to students in all years of the medical curriculum. A retest was given 45 days later to evaluate reliability. To assess validity, the questionnaire also included sociodemographic data, the Duke Religion Index, the Empathy Inventory, the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref), and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Results: A total of 776 medical students (M age = 22.34 years, SD = 3.11) were assessed. The Brazilian Portuguese version of ESWIM showed good internal consistency for the factor of Empathy (α = 0.79-0.81) and borderline internal consistency for the other factors: Openness to Spirituality (α = 0.61–0.66), Wellness (α = 0.57–0.68), and Tolerance (α = 0.56–0.65). The principal component analysis revealed a four-factor structure; however, the confirmatory factor analysis showed a better fit for a three-factor structure. We found a significant positive correlation between ESWIM empathy and empathy measured by the Empathy Inventory (r =.444, p <.01), as well as negative correlations between ESWIM empathy and burnout (r = −.145 to −.224, p <.01). ESWIM openness to spirituality was also significantly correlated with different subscales of religiosity (r =.301–.417, p <.01), and ESWIM wellness was significantly correlated with the WHOQOL-Bref factors (r =.390–.673, p <.01). The test–retest reliability (applied to 83 students) was high for all factors except Tolerance. Conclusion: This study provides supportive evidence regarding the reliability and validity of ESWIM empathy scores. The ESWIM scale opens a new field of research in relation to openness to spirituality by introducing a scale that measures this openness attitude. Despite borderline internal consistency, ESWIM wellness was strongly associated with quality of life and had good test–retest reliability. Thus, ESWIM appears to be a valid option for evaluating these constructs in medical students. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","empathy; medical education; spirituality; validation; wellness","article; burnout; confirmatory factor analysis; curriculum; empathy; English (language); field study; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; medical education; medical student; Portuguese (language); principal component analysis; quality of life; questionnaire; religion; test retest reliability; validation process; validity; world health organization; adolescent; adult; Brazil; cultural competence; factor analysis; female; male; physician; psychology; validation study; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Cultural Competency; Empathy; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Physicians; Spirituality; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045128873

Method: A descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out in the Medical School No. 1 of Santiago de Cuba University of Medical Sciences, in the period 2012-2016. Results: The activities imparted were classified based on type, corresponding programs, the teaching category of the main professors and the venues where they were carried out. The number of accredited activities was compared with that of other training activities as different ways of updating knowledge. Among the main results, there was a predominance of the teaching of courses, lack of significant differences between the activities taught by assistant and auxiliary professors, and predominance of varied activities not prioritized by the Ministry of Health as an advisory body, together with those for general training. Generally speaking, professional improvement experienced an increase in the five-year period. Conclusions: Professional improvement activities experienced a progressive increase in each academic year, using as the main types of postgraduate courses those that were mostly related to the prioritized public health programs. © 2018, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

In order to do it, a comparative documental research was carried out, with a cutoff period between the years of 2009 and 2016. For data collection, treatment and analysis, the software IBM SPSS Statistics was used. The variables studied were: total enrollment in the common classroom; gender; educational stage and total enrollment in Specialized Educational Service (SES). The results showed an increase in enrollments of students with ASD in regular education, which is more evident after 2012; a change in the ratio of female and male students along the period studied, tending towards a proportion of one female student for each 4.5 male students with ASD; high rates of school evasion, which is associated with a low rate of enrollment in SEA. It was concluded that even though the access to regular classroom increased considerably in all Brazilian regions, it is still necessary to rethink the support strategies for this target population. With regards to the Law No. 12.74/2012, its impact could be noticed only in the first two studied variables. © 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

The appearance of Bird's transport phenomena textbook put transport phenomena as an engineering science along with thermodynamics for chemical engineers. Even though this field provides some important fundamentals to solve upcoming undergraduate problems, we have found that students constantly perceive this field as abstract and difficult to apply due to the fashion in which the problems are posed, the mathematics involved, and the three-dimensional view required to understand the phenomena. Chemical product design on the other hand represents the fourth paradigm which has permitted the evolution of the formation of the engineer to a more market-oriented design, so the student becomes more aware of the impact of his design.

The main objective of the program was to increase math and language test scores of these schools through on-site teacher training, principal training and textbooks for students. Using census data from public schools containing detailed longitudinal information since 2010, the starting year of the program, and taking advantage of targeting rules based on dropout and grade repetition rates we fit a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate program impacts. We also fit a difference-in-difference matching model as well as blocking with regressions to estimate the ATT impact of the program, based on observed characteristics used in the targeting process. Overall results indicate no significant impact of the program on test scores, grade repetition nor dropout rates. Additional analyses from a representative sample of 400 schools collected in the field suggest that deficiencies in the program's design and implementation could explain the lack of significant program impacts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-level intervention; Program design and implementation; Regression discontinuity","education; experimental design; language; mathematics; regression analysis; student; teacher training; textbook; Colombia","Universidad de los Andes, Uniandes","We gratefully acknowledge all the information provided by the Ministry of Education and the ELP team, particularly Lina María López, Juan Carlos Hernández, Paola Trujillo, Manuel Rivera, and Rodrigo Sepúlveda.

Most search engines base their algorithms on a resource's text or popularity, requiring teachers to navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource. This makes searching for resources a tedious and cumbersome task. Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aim to facilitate the discovery of quality resources. Nevertheless, the abundance and variety of content make searching a complex task. Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content by determining clusters of similar users and inferring users interest in a resource, assembling clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both. Probabilistic model-based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make it possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with various degrees of probability. In this paper, we used recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers over the course of four years and under natural conditions. We found that a hybrid recommendation, the Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset. In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommender's accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","E-learning; educational metadata; probabilistic models; Recommender systems","Correlation methods; Curricula; E-learning; Metadata; Probabilistic logics; Recommender systems; Search engines; Teaching; Bayes method; Collaboration; Educational metadata; Educational resource; Hybrid recommendation; Primary and secondary education; Probabilistic modeling; Probabilistic models; Computational complexity",,"The authors would like to thank Fundacion Chile - Educar Chile for making available the learning resources repository for this research.

The aim of the present study is to describe motivational profiles of medical students in three universities of Ecuador. Material and methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was performed on the motivational profiles of medical students in three Medical Schools of Ecuador. Motivation was assessed using Academic Motivation Scale validated in Spanish and applied using Google Forms®. Results: A pilot test was performed first to evaluate clarity of the virtual tool used. After which, a total of 538 invitations were sent to the three universities. There were 124 responses (response rate of 23.04%). During the analysis, an association was found between extrinsic motivation, instructional level, and having children. Intrinsic motivation was associated with trying to enter to the university and number of hours dedicated to study. Conclusion: More detailed studies need to be conducted on motivation in university students, both on descriptions and interventions in curricula. The association between hours dedicated to study and intrinsic motivation suggests the reinforcement of motivation activities to obtain adherence to academic programs. © 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Academic motivation scale; Medical students; Motivation; Online form; Self-determination theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650218

This, leads to the inevitability of comprehensive training for students and professionals in the biomedical sciences, focused on a human and drug-safety perspective. This is an essential tool for the prevention of a public health problem. Objective: To determine the reasons for self-medication in families. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional case study was conducted between March and August 2013. Information was collected using a questionnaire completed by 51 families. An analysis was performed with 95% confidence intervals and an error of 1.9% using the Epidat 3.1 statistics program. Results: Self-medication without prescription was chosen by 42% of families due to the influence of the media (primarily television), as well as its therapeutic effect. The medicines most frequently used were for common diseases such as influenza, which occurred in 37.25% of adults, 19.61% of children, and 5.88% of elderly family members. The second most common (50.98%) was for hypertension. The highest incidence was by adults (27. 45%) and by the elderly (19.61%). Another use of iterative of medicines is against migraine (39.22%). Discussion: It is evident that there are subjectivities in the chain of use of medicines, with no regard to the risk of affecting public health. Therefore, the challenge of renewing teaching comprehensive training in biomedicine, should be according to socio-cultural educational typology of the professional, student and patient. Thereby allowing the dialogue of knowledge in the decision to use or not to use a particular medicine. © 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Biomedical comprehensive training; Family; Pharmaceutical care; Public health; Self-medication",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017437067

Students can follow visually the actual transfer of the reagent by the catalyst, and its consumption in the organic phase, in a step-by-step process that employs a colored charge-transfer (CT) complex as the transferred reacting species. Consumption of the transferred nucleophile is followed by discoloration of the organic phase. This transfer-consumption cycle can be repeated several times by shaking the two separated phases again, allowing students to finally grasp the whole process as a continuous repetition of these cycles.

In the present case, we have investigated the role of public education policy, under the New Public Management logic, as an inducer and reproducer of inequalities. Our results suggest that PEI is based on an insular logic, which produces school units for students already privileged in their relations with the city. In addition, the implementation of the Program has provoked an outflow of students, with a positive effect on the socioeconomic levels (SEL) of the PEI schools and on their results in large-scale evaluations. This effect was counterbalanced by the negative effect in the school units around the PEI schools, where we observed a decrease in the number of students with higher SEL. In addition, if compared to the surrounding schools and to the public-school system itself, PEI schools have fewer classes and students. They are schools for the minority: the students with highest SEL of the system. In these schools, we also observe the preference for a single-cycle organization, which places PEI in the same line as the controversial proposal of School Reorganization in 2015. © 2018, Arizona State University.

It acknowledges earlier contributions to understanding and structuring teachers’ knowledge, in particular, the special debt owed to Shulman’s notion of pedagogical content knowledge and to Ball and collaborators’ Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT), influential for the specialised nature of one of its sub-domains. The authors’ research with teachers has led them to explore the characteristics of MKT and to refine the descriptors relating to its sub-domains, a task which has underlined the difficulty involved in unambiguously delimiting the boundaries which separate these. As a result, and taking into consideration a broader view of the specialised nature of the teacher’s mathematical knowledge, the authors propose a framework which, whilst respecting the major domains of Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge, regards the specialisation in respect of mathematical knowledge as a property which is inherent to the model and extends across all sub-domains. © 2018, © 2018 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.","mathematical knowledge for teaching; specialised knowledge; Teachers’ knowledge",,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO; Universidad de Huelva, UHU","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP), and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Ministry of Economy Industry and Competitiveness.","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP) and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research.",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050277223

The objective of the study was to evaluate the design and development processes of the course and assessed its achievements in the participating population in order to obtain inputs for curricular noticing and decision making on its design and implementation in later years. Regarding the methodology, the study was framed in qualitative-descriptive research; the anecdotal records of the tutor-teacher were the instruments to collect information. Categories were defined in a process of systematization of experiences, and the units of analysis were defined from relevant aspects of the course to analyze the information. The systematization of this experience and its analysis have allowed the identification of cognitive and motivational specificities in the students, as well as methodological and evaluative particularities in the teachers. Also, from the results based on critical interpretation, some suggestions were proposed; these suggestions are addressed to the offer of the course and the curricular changes that can be made to improve its design and the student’s learning during the sessions. © 2018 Film and History.

In consequence, the research has as a general objective that is to demonstrate that the application of the Arquered improves the students’ learning process. The research approach is a quantitative and explanatory type. Likewise, the quasi-experimental design, with post-test only and control group, has been chosen. A non-probability sampling was implemented and consisted of 55 students, of which 30 were selected from the morning shift (control group), and 25 from the night shift (experimental group).

Further revisions of instructors reveal to the students their mistakes, such as a lack of argumentation. However, the depth of revisions is often limited by the time availability of the instructor. In this paper, we present a system for argument assessment embedded in an Internet-based Moodle course with Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard, to help students improve argumentation in the problem statement, justification and conclusion sections of their final project report. The system identifies argumentative paragraphs along with argumentation level and provides recommendations to improve their writing. The analysis is achieved employing machine learning techniques with lexical features trained using an annotated collection of student writings. We performed a pilot test to compare control and experimental groups. Both groups consisted of undergraduate students of computer engineering programs from two different universities. We observed that using the argument assessment system increased the number of arguments in the experimental group. We discuss some further improvements for the system. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","academic writing; argumentation studies; computer-assisted argument analysis; engineering education Moodle","Computer aided analysis; Computer aided instruction; Human computer interaction; Interoperability; Learning systems; Academic writings; Argument assessment; argumentation studies; Computer assisted; Computer engineering; Computer engineering program; Machine learning techniques; Undergraduate students; Students","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 357381; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONCYT","The first author was supported by CONACYT, México, through scholarship 357381.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053821784

We focus on the mathematics textbook assessments, describing their evolution and commenting on some of their accomplishments and problems. The first assessment was carried out for the 1997 school year and retained basically its initial formulation, with changes and improvements, til the assessment for the 2018 school year. As of now, the program is undergoing substantial changes which are briefly discussed and which worry many educators. This assessment was responsible for a definite improvement of mathematics textbooks for elementary, middle and high schools in Brazil. It constitutes a good example of a successful program, coordinated by competent persons from mathematics education, schools of education and mathematics departments of good universities, at first without political interference, and strongly backed by powerful officials in MEC. In the last few years, pressures from publishers and conservative groups have undermined the assessments, with possibly serious consequences. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Mathematics education; Mathematics textbooks; National textbook policies; Textbooks assessment",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053230050

They appear in a variety of forms and adopt various approaches to present the content. In this paper, we turn our attention to one chapter of a calculus textbook and our focus is on the introduction of the derivative concept. With the purpose of examining the presentation of the derivative concept in the textbook, we give a view of Peirce’s semiotics, in particular of his classification of sign-vehicles. The analysis allows us to point out that the sign-vehicle in relation to the derivative concept may be iconic, indexical, or symbolic. These do not constitute mutually exclusive kinds of signs, but they are interrelated in such a way that we can identify iconicity in indexicality and indexicality in symbolicity. We conclude that the textbook has the potential to enable students to conceptualize the derivative. However, in some aspects, the book may constrain students’ conceptualization and it could be improved to meet the students’ needs to make meaning of the derivative concept. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053190566

In particular, we acknowledge the EAD undergraduate courses in Brazil as an important governmental initiative for teacher education. Amongst other specificities of the Brazilian model of distance education, one aspect consists of writing proper material and textbooks, raising a need to investigate the results of their conception and development. We report on a case study in which a chapter in a written textbook developed by a group of professors is analysed according to hermeneutics, describing the tessiture of the text and context of the implemented task. Aware that the task demanded processes different from those used when writing textbooks for face-to-face lecture courses, though at the same time not coinciding with the wordings of the interactions of a classroom lecture, the group of authors agreed on a notion of lessons on paper. Our analysis faces the challenge of problematising qualitative differences regarding the semiotic means of the mathematics embedded in face-to-face versus distance learning activities, raising questions on the nature of their results and the development of induced thinking in both contexts. Investigating the kind of mathematical knowledge produced for the lessons on paper texts, we drew on whether the written lesson for distance education is closer to the pedagogical-content knowledge than to the classical academic knowledge. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Distance education; Hermeneutics; Interpretation methodology; Mathematical knowledge; Textbook development",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053186078

However, ITS community still lacks a current understanding of how authoring tools are used by non-programmer authors to design ITS. Hence, the objective of this work is to review how authoring tools have been supporting ITS design for non-programmer authors. In order to meet our goal, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the primary studies on the use of ITS authoring tools, following a pre-defined review protocol. Among the 4622 papers retrieved from seven digital libraries published from 2009 to June 2016, 33 papers are finally included after applying our exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then identify the main ITS components authored, the ITS types designed, the features used to facilitate the authoring process, the technologies used to develop authoring tools and the time at which authoring occurs. We also look for evidence of the benefits of ITS authoring tools. In summary, the main findings of this work are: (1) there is empirical evidence of the benefits (i.e., mainly in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, quality of authored artifacts, and usability) of using ITS authoring tools for non-programmer authors, specially to aid authoring of learning content and to support authoring of model-tracing/cognitive and example-tracing tutors; 2) domain and pedagogical models have been much more targeted by authoring tools; (3) several ITS types have been authored, with an emphasis on model-tracing/cognitive and example-tracing tutors; (4) besides providing features for authoring all four ITS components, current authoring tools are also presenting general features (e.g., view learners’ statistics and reuse tutor design) to create broader authoring tools; (5) a great diversity of technologies, which include AI techniques, software solutions and distributed technologies, are used to develop ITS authoring tools; and (6) authoring tools have been mainly targeting ITS design before students’ instruction, but works are also addressing authoring during and/or post-instruction relying both on human and artificial intelligence. We conclude this work by showing several promising research opportunities that are quite important and interesting but underexplored in current research and practice. © 2017, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Authoring tools; Intelligent tutoring systems; Intelligent tutoring systems design; Systematic literature review","Computer aided instruction; Computer software reusability; Digital libraries; Engineering education; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Teaching; Authoring tool; Distributed technologies; Example-tracing tutors; Intelligent tutoring system; Research opportunities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Highway planning","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Acknowledgements This work has been supported by the Brazilian institutions: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) and Coordenac¸ão de Aperfeic¸oa-mento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050940146

It is argued that neoliberal market values are embedded in the mathematics education, through the articulation of abstract and formal reasoning with techno-scientific knowledge, for the purpose of competitive production.

Although there are a large number of studies on the subject of culture, these are qualitative in nature and not focused on school contexts. Our aim is to develop a quantitative instrument for primary education that determines the cultural texture within an individual institution, as well as among different kinds of schools. For this purpose, Hofstede's original instrument was adapted, taking into consideration the characteristics and practices of primary school students. A factor analysis and complementary qualitative analysis of the factors obtained from 783 surveys (administered to third and fourth graders) led to the creation of five dimensions, which contrasted with Hofstede's theoretical dimensions. These dimensions include Value of School Achievement, Value of Institutional Structure, Resistance to change, Normative versus Affective and Value of Equality in the Production of Knowledge. Furthermore, this new set of dimensions was a more accurate representation of the school context and the values held by primary school students. Significant differences were found in three of the dimensions when analyzing the cultural differences of the sample and taking into account the students’ socioeconomic background. These findings are important as they reveal the presence of subcultures within a given society, which are determined by belonging to a certain socioeconomic class. Measuring cultural values among primary school students contributes to the creation of educational models, the design of educational institutions and the development of public policy since new structures cannot succeed without adequate cultural support. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural dimensions in schools; Culture and education; Quantitative test for culture",,"1150045; 13/2014","This research was funded by CONICYT-FONDECYT grant 1150045 , and by the VRI-UC Interdisciplinary Research Project N° 13/2014 .",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044286198

To address this problem, researchers have developed models to structure the process. However, we maintain that it is first necessary to understand how students actually search for information online when solving an information problem and compare their behaviours with the available literature. To do this, we collected and analysed the data on a laboratory setting of 41 students while they solved 16 information problems using the internet and expressed aloud what they were thinking whilst solving them. We identified 21 categories of actions, grouped into 9 activity types associated with four information search processes, showing that some of the students’ stereotyped search behaviours are in fact conscious decisions based on the requirements of the task and the answers found. The results also show that searching for information on the internet can not only vary depending on the task’s requirements, but also on the number of iterations students need to perform to reach an answer. These findings provide some evidence that challenge the assumption that students simply lack the competencies to search for information on the internet; rather, it seems that they show an awareness of different strategies, which they decide to use based on the context and purpose of the task, making their search behaviour more elaborated and complex than is usually portrayed by researchers in the field. Based on this, implications and further research lines are also discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computer literacy; Digital competencies; Information problem-solving; Search strategies; Student internet search",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1151044; 21140227","Acknowledgements This research was possible thanks to support from the projects: Fondecyt N° 1151044 Identification of the characteristics of Internet research tasks that promote higher cognitive processes and better search strategies in high school students; Fondef N° ID15I10264 Development of digital skills through a system that supports the design and management of school assignments based on solving information and communication problems using the Internet; and financing provided by the program Formation of Advanced Human Capital through the grant 21140227 for the National Doctorate Program 2014.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042787335

Design/methodology/approach: In an effort to understand student outcomes provided by the SH, an in-depth literature review on practical learning environments and interview methods were applied. The following open-ended questions were asked in an effort to gather and consolidate student experiences with the SH. What are your experiences in/with SH? Please tell us briefly about your experiences. The language has been adjusted and interviewers answered questions and made clarifications if asked to. Master’s in international sustainable tourism (MIST) program students were selected for this study. Participants’ responses were recorded using the computer-assisted personal interviewing technique. Findings: The most important characteristic students recognized about the SH is that it “provided us a safe place to fail”. One student described SH as “[…] a safe space where students can gain experiences of learning new processes firsthand without external pressures (e.g., on-the-job training, eventuation, and financial analysis)”. The safety attribute of the SH environment is considered as a comfortable place to learn from other classmates or visitors (mostly volunteers and interns). It is a “real” hospitality and tourism business-learning center, which is a great benefit to the students not only because of its environment but also because of the diversity among student’s educational and professional backgrounds. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitations of this study need to be addressed. The number of interviews was very limited with one year data which could affect the generalizability of this study. In addition, it was not clearly explained to the student what rubrics and standardized metrics were used during interview process; after interview, students were asked to provide a better way to improve the research outcomes. For further studies, it is strongly recommended to provide the direction to make sure it applies to the conditions that are prevalent in the existing site to be examined. Practical implications: Both strategies that link the SH to this MIST program have significant merit. Students implementing best practices in the courses have clearly identified the challenges of implementation, but all agree that there is tremendous value in the experiences they have received during their studies. Furthermore, using the SH as an engagement tool has motivated students to consciously interactive and collaborative in a more proactive manner. Originality/value: This unique experience and operational competency at the SH provides participants with an in-depth understanding of the context and challenges of sustainability but needs to be detailed and promoted more in the future. The SH is facilitating a learning environment among not only students but also faculty and staff. The results clearly indicated that the SH has influenced sustainable behaviors by promoting interactive engagement. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Experimental learning techniques; Innovative learning environment; International learning environment; Team-based learning",,"Wallace Genetic Foundation, WGF","In early 2013, the prospect of having a laboratory for the MIST Program became reality. The opportunity arose when the MIST Program was asked to take part in a project that consisted of restoring a historic building structure located in the Botanical Gardens at CATIE’s main campus in Turrialba. The historic on campus structure, known as the “escuelita” (little school) had been abandoned for many years and was deteriorating amid the humid tropical weather. Program faculty discussed the project with CATIE administration and were given the clearance and opportunity to repurpose the building as a SH to be used by educational programming focused on sustainability. Faculty at CATIE was initially awarded a $15,000 grant from the Wallace Genetic Foundation II to restore and repurpose the facility. However, the restoration of the SH was projected to cost four times more than the initial award. The SH facility consists of a central lodging facility with several external gazebos around the structure. There are four rooms that serve as living quarters for 14-18 people in bunk-style beds, a centralized living/activity room, four bathrooms and a laundry room. The SH also includes an outside area that includes several gazebos that are located directly adjacent to the house with each connected to a centralized covered walkway.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049795606

To strengthen the work of teachers in classroom is necessary to assess their professional practice. This study was conducted with the purpose of designing an instrument for assessing the performance of teachers of secondary education, through the opinions of their students. The conceptual model used was Danielson's Teaching Framework, Edition 2013. The development process committed: (a) to elaborate an item pool and identify evidence of content validity; (b) to reduce the number of items using an optimization process measurement; (c) to obtain evidence of construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis. The product obtained was an instrument of 30 items, which allow us to evaluate three of the four dimensions of Danielson framework: (1) Quality Planning and preparation of teaching activities, (2) Classroom climate, and (3) Teaching or instruction. © 2018 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

De tal manera que los aspectos considerados en esta dimensión, no son necesariamente “accesibles” para el estudiante, y por ende, éste no puede dar cuenta de ellos. En consecuencia, la eliminación de la cuarta dimensión, se considera más una ganancia, que una pérdida.",,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059165352

Binary logistic regression analysis was used. The dropout rate was 26.8%. In the total sample and among students with an adequate BMI, there was a greater probability of dropout with an increase in age. For overweight students, increased age and socioeconomic status, and studying in the afternoon period were predictors of dropout from the intervention.

Three facultymembers at University of Campinas, Brazil, taught the same CS1 course for the same majors in two different semesters, one version in Python and one in C, with a total of 391 students involved in the experiment. We measured the dropout rate, the failure rate, the grades on the two exams, the proportion of completed lab assignments, and the number of submissions per completed assignment. There was no difference in the dropout rate. The failure rate for Python was 16.9% against 23.1% for C.

The question that guides our research is: What do the papers published in BOLEMA reveal about the semiotic approaches in Mathematics Education researches? So, our article brings to light the perspectives and issues that have been the focus of research about semiotics in Mathematics Education. We have identified three approaches in the research: the theory proposed by Charles S.Peirce; the theoretical constructs of Raymond Duval; and the ontosemiotic approach, whose mentor is Juan D. Godino. Our article presents elements that are considered relevant in each of these approaches, as well as the semiotic approaches of the 23 analyzed papers. Then, we present a summary that reveals the perspectives, issues, and understandings about semiotcs identified in the papers we analyzed and aim to establish some articulations between them.

To achieve that purpose, we used results of a previous research about mathematics problem solving, in which high school students were asked to solve a trigonometry question with two items. In the present work, questionnaires were answered by twenty high school teachers, who were asked to characterize the kind of the most representative errors found in that research, as well as to propose ways of intervention in mathematics teaching that could stimulate the students to critically think about their errors, in order to overcome them. The teachers' answers were analysed upon the light of two theoretical frameworks: the first deals with mathematical learning by using semiotic analysis, as proposed by Duval, and the second one is related to the teacher's knowledge, according to Shulman. From this analysis, we proposed a methodological design to the qualitative analysis of teaching activities in the pedagogical approach of problem solving in mathematics. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

It is proposed that this notion is a useful tool in teachers' teaching practice and that it is necessary to prepare teachers in their capacity to formulate hypothetical learning trajectories about specific mathematics school topics. It is therefore also necessary to explore the learning processes that teachers undergo when learning this notion in their education. In this article, we introduce the notion of learning hypotheses as an adaptation of the idea of hypothetical learning trajectory (SIMON, 1995). We describe how the groups of secondary-school mathematics teachers that participated in a teacher education program understood and used this notion in order to determine the contribution of a set of tasks to a learning goal previously established. We found that the groups developed their knowledge of the notion of learning hypotheses and used it in a heterogeneous way, and that the education program was partly successful in its goal to make the groups of teachers learn and perceive the notion's utility. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The objective is to have an instrument that promotes teacher reflection about teaching and learning experiences within a specific content. The starting point which the research method takes is the systematic review of the didactic-mathematical knowledge of each of the facets in which an educational process is decomposed: epistemic-ecological, cognitive-affective, and instructional (interactional and use of technological means). Subsequently, the DSAG is applied to an educational experience with students of secondary education. The results of this application reveal this tool's potential to streamline the reflection on the practice itself, to establish relationships between the different facets, and to identify possible improvements in the design in successive cycles. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The objective of this research is to develop and validate an instrument which measures the affect of making mistakes in mathematics, and the affect towards mathematics due to errors. The instrument items are based on the relation between the error commission and the three affectivity components: emotions, beliefs, and attitudes. It was administrated to 319 freshmen in the Business School at a private university in Guadalajara, Mexico. The instrument showed strong reliability with an alpha Cronbach of 0,9. Factor analysis confirmed its validity with five constructs related to errors, that explain 52,73% of the total variance: 1) negative emotions and affects on making mistakes, 2) favorable conduct towards the use of errors as a learning tool, 3) mistaken conceptions in regards to usefulness of errors, 4) negative beliefs and emotions towards mathematics due to making mistakes, and 5) the belief that one can learn mathematics from errors. To be able to measure the affectivity students have developed towards errors in mathematics and towards mathematics due to making mistakes as well as their conceptions about errors, may offer a clearer view about of the error culture they have experienced during their school time. Due to this experience, beliefs and attitudes were formed and their behavior may tend to be favorable or not favorable towards their mathematics learning. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Between 2002 and 2011 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1282 schools closed -roughly one-tenth of the current stock- and 2350 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which contains individual students’ academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 49 and 68% (1.8 and 2.5 percentage points). Also, school exit implies between 3.9 and 4.4 percentage points increase in the probability of grade retention in fifth grade. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dropout; Education; Grade retention; Market turnout; School choice; School closure","academic performance; educational attainment; market system; probability; secondary education; student; Chile","CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009; FB0003","We thank the Chilean Ministry of Education for providing the data.

Famous polymaths from history include Galileo Galilei, Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart, and Albert Einstein; individuals that have impacted science, arts, humanities, and our society for centuries. However, from a neuropsychological point of view and social perspective, it is unclear whether these gifted subjects developed their abilities because of inherited neurobiological or anatomical differences when compared to average people, or their skills and functional advantages were a result of specific environmental factors or stimulus inducing brain plasticity changes that reflect in cognitive improvements. In this discussion report, we present literature evidence from basic health sciences supporting the hypothesis that polymaths may be “born” based on their individual genetic characteristics but also “trained” by surrounding environmental factors or stimulus. At the functional level, polymaths may have a number advantages regarding creativity, resilience, and versatility. Since educational strategies are nowadays more focused on specialization rather than developing multidisciplinary professionals for the future, one could speculate whether these conventional approaches should be updated to stimulate polymathy in future generations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Connectivity; Creativity; Education; Innovation; Intellectual ability; Intellectual performance; Plasticity; Polymathy; Resilience; Stimulus; Versatility",,"Minerva Foundation; Turun Yliopisto","Acknowledgements FZC is grateful to FINDOS Turku Grant for Completing a Doctoral Degree (University of Turku), University of Turku Joint Research Grant Fund, and Selma and Maja-Lisa Selander′ s Fund (Minerva Foundation, Helsinki) for supporting this work.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047269571

Background: Several studies have explored the efficacy of computer-based, multi-representational teaching of electric circuits for novice learners. Existing research has found that instructional use of computational models that move from abstract to concrete representations can foster students' comprehension of electric circuit concepts, but other features of effective instruction using computational models need further investigation. Research Questions: 1) Is there a correlation between students' representational fluency and their ability to reason qualitatively on electric circuits? and 2) Is the quality of student-generated computational representations correlated to their conceptual understanding of electric circuits? Methodology: The study comprised two cases in which 51 sophomore-engineering students completed a voluntary assignment designed to assess their representational fluency and conceptual understanding of electric circuits. Qualitative insights from the first case informed the design of a scoring rubric that served as both the assessment and the data collection instrument. Findings: The results suggest that a multi-representational approach aimed at the construction of computational models can foster conceptual understanding of electric circuits. The number and quality of students' representations showed a positive correlation with their conceptual understanding. In particular, the quality of the computational representations was found to be highly, and significantly, correlated with the correctness of students' answers to qualitative reasoning questions. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","circuit analysis; computer engineering; Electrical engineering; mental models; rubric; simulation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Education; Education computing; Electric network analysis; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Job analysis; Mathematical models; Students; Timing circuits; Cognition; Computational model; Computer engineering; Integrated circuit modeling; Media; Mental model; rubric; simulation; Task analysis; Electric network parameters","National Science Foundation, NSF: EEC 1449238","Manuscript received May 15, 2017; revised December 9, 2017 and March 9, 2018; accepted March 19, 2018.

Aiming to encourage new methodologies for the teaching of chemistry in higher education, a novel didactic game was developed and applied in order to provide parallel support to undergraduate chemistry students learning about molecular symmetry. This educational resource was well-accepted by the students and was found to be a ludic evaluation tool for the study of symmetry. The game was applied to undergraduate chemistry sophomores and was found to be a powerful tool to improve students' skills in several topics, including molecular geometry, spatial molecular projections, and electronic and vibrational spectroscopy. During the activities, students participated by sharing their doubts about the presence of symmetry.

While study of the social, political, and cultural implications of migration in Mexico has been predominant in academia and public policy circles, the importance of intercultural education services targeting youth migration continues to be marginalised. Not only are the characterisations concerning child migration obsolete, the focus of academic analysis and the implementation of public policy is overwhelmingly adult-centric and ignores the pluricultural nature of Mexican society. Furthermore, even though the country has widespread legislation and policies addressing its pluricultural makeup, the intercultural education is largely out of reach for the majority of migrant youth in Mexico. The socio-economic effects of this divide are an increasing number of alienated, marginalised, and poorly educated indigenous and other migrant youth mainly from Central American and returning Mexican migrants from the US that are falling outside the framework of a productive Mexican society. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Central American youth; intercultural education; pluricultural; Returning Mexicans",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054163565

In the latter part of the twentieth century, a number of community universities were established in the South of Brazil, characterised by democratic local community involvement, expansion of access in non-metropolitan regions, and close ties with local industry. This article analyses these innovative institutions in relation to the complex demands of the so-called knowledge economy and multifaceted relationships between public and private, exploring the ways in which the public good role of universities manifests itself in relation to the local. Given their hybrid nature–independent from the state but with a public good mission–these institutions can be seen to represent a new model of non-state public higher education.

The color issues in the Brazilian Census and the experiences, including the racial designation as an open response, has been studied since 1872, and it is noted that there are two dimensions to be observed in the affirmative action debate: a structural and other cultural involving race/color classifications in Brazil. The statistics are fundamental to build the best evidence in shaping public policy. On the other hand, we must recognize ethnic and racial identities as cultural phenomena that are susceptible to change, which drives us to continue the discussion, trying to capture the meaning of these transformations.

Thus, it is necessary that Special Education is also the subject of research on Teaching Science, but studies indicate that there is little research in this area. As such, the aim of this work was to carry out a national bibliographical survey to evaluate how the research area of teaching Science has approached the Special Education theme. The bibliographic research was carried out in line with the revision procedures defined by Content Analysis and used six journals of strata A1 and A2 defined by CAPES qualis as corpus of information. The searches were carried out from five descriptors: inclusion, inclusive education, special education, special educational needs and teacher education. According to the selection criteria, only 28 papers were found: 15 on teaching Science and learning; 12 on the education of Science teachers from the perspective of Special Education and one on evaluation and curriculum for Special Education. Most of these works were written by Éder Pires de Camargo and Anna Maria Canavarro Benite, and the teaching of Physics for the visually impaired is the theme that has been published the most. The publications began in 2006, reaching the largest number of publications in 2015.

However, there are few studies about the awareness of this population about their rights. Thus, understanding this theme will allow the formulation of proposals for future interventions in the sense of the effective access of these people to take advantage of their fundamental rights. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to verify if people with motor disability are aware and take advantage of their rights. For this, a descriptive cross-sectional study was drawn up with a convenience sample composed of 39 people with physical disabilities. The participants answered a questionnaire about awareness and use of the rights of the person with disability. As a result, it was verified that the group was comprised of mainly female adults who can move around and are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Most of them stopped working after an event/illness, receive some benefit from the Government and practically do not leave home, except for health treatment. Accessibility in and around external places, was identified as a difficulty for the majority of the participants. The group demonstrated to know little about their specific rights, and they take advantage from the most propagated ones, such as: social security benefits and priority service. Thus, it is important not just to approve laws, but also to educate part of society including the people with disabilities about their rights, so they can benefit from them. © 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

To establish whether analogy making plays a role in this process of learning, we devised a classroom game based on an analysis of a number-line analogy that leverages children' spatial intuitions for helping them understand the numbers. To investigate the role of spatial positioning along the number line, seventy-seven preschoolers were randomly assigned to control tasks (control condition) or to embodied number line tasks in two possible spatial locations: watching numbers increasing either from left to right (space-number alignment condition) or from right to left (space-number misalignment condition). Performing learning activities for roughly two hours promoted children's proficiency in four tasks of numerical knowledge, but only children under spatial and numerical alignment increased their proficiency in a task of number line estimation. This finding shows that the numerical representations generated by children during training were integrated with spatial information that was implicit in the learning activities, thus revealing that analogical alignments play a key role in the formation of early numerical representations. Additionally, this study illustrates that interrogating the analogy at the foundation of an instructional activity highlights key instructional decisions that can have a large impact on learning.

The pregraduate curricula of all universities include internal medicine as a one year subject, usually in the last year, held in a hospital setting. The degree of physician grants the right to practice medicine in Paraguay. Access to medical residencies in Paraguay is through two ways: 1) A single medical residency admissions exam; 2) Credits obtained through the curriculum and research activities The only way to obtain a specialization in internal medicine in Paraguay is through a medical residency combining clinical training and postgraduate university education. Residency programs in internal medicine are 3 years in length. Accreditation of the training centers is up to the Paraguayan Society of Internal Medicine. Only full, active participation is allowed. Observorship is not, because training centers are ruled by the country's labor laws, which do not include non remunerated clinical work. Recertification is done every 5 years, either through an examination or accumulation of credits (points). It is worrisome to see the number of young medical graduates choosing internal medicine as a final specialty, which has continuously decreased over the past years.

At present in the country there are 9 Schools of Medicine in 8 National public universities; 6 autonomous with dissimilar curricula. It is awarded as a Medical Surgeon, and all of them have the goal of forming a doctor according to the requirements of the health systems: the General Practitioner. In 2005, the teaching of medicine outside formal university schools began with the National Training Program Comprehensive Community Medicine, product of the Sandino agreement between Venezuela and Cuba. The title to be awarded would be The Integral Community Medicine (MIC), with its consequences for the health system and for the health of the population. The number of Specialization Courses as well as the Masters have increased, so that by 2012, there were 171 Postgraduate Courses fully functioning in the Faculty of Medicine of the UCV and in total there are 351 Specialization Courses, Masters and Doctorates In the Medical Schools of the Venezuelan Universities. Admission to postgraduate courses is done through admission tests organized by the Postgraduate Studies Commissions of the respective Faculties of Medicine. The student receives during the years of training a salary scholarship from the host institution of the postgraduate course. Once the postgraduate residence is finished and after the defense of a Special Degree Work (TEG), the university degree is conferred by the corresponding university. In recent years, a serious situation has arisen, as regards the Specialization Courses, such as the marked decrease in the annual demand for these courses, a phenomenon that has affected most of them, with their evident repercussions on the number of postgraduate residents in hospitals. Research indicates among the factors that are causing this problem are: the evident phenomenon of medical migration that is occurring in Venezuela, low remuneration, continued governmental disqualification towards the national medical profession and preference given to foreign doctors, personal insecurity, the positive attitude of other nations to the possibility of well-trained Venezuelan physicians, the burden of care, and the deterioration of the infrastructure of our health centers. A proposal is made for the transformation of medical education in Venezuela; to construct a friendly and transferable methodology for the design of Curricula by Professional Competence with the objective of orienting the process of curricular transformation of the medical studies in degree and postgraduate in the country. There are many barriers but we have taken up the challenge and will take advantage of the resources to improve our pedagogical practices. © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Education based on professional competence; Medical education; Venezuela",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046138022

Metaphors are mappings from a source domain (e.g., a stream) to a target domain (e.g., a sequence of bytes). Typically computing phenomena are explained using incoherent discourses at the source domain, formed by metaphors taken from a diversity of origins. Nonetheless, versatility of metaphors allows for the creation of coherent discourses in the origin domain that map the target computing discourse, and we call them allegories. The limited number of existing studies about this topic has compared only textual allegories, visual allegories, and the traditional unconnected metaphors. Although their findings are heterogeneous, equal effectiveness is the most frequent empirical result between these three types of metaphors. Furthermore, we have not found any study about oral allegories, in spite of oral being the most used modality for metaphors in computer science education. This article experimentally compares the effects of oral allegories and oral metaphors on a complex problem-solving task. As in previous studies, our results did not find any significant differences on support or detriment of oral allegories.

A number of different tools have been proposed in order to obtain a reasonable assessment of teacher performance. Nonetheless, residentś appraisal is currenlty the most simple and complete measurement tool available. Objective: To evaluate clinical tutor performance through the opinion of residents using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Method: Observational and cross-sectional study conducted in a secondary care hospital. The following specialties were included: internal medicine, general surgery, pathology, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, traumatology, radiology, anaesthesiology, and gynaecology. All medical teachers and residents were included. A standardised questionnaire, developed by Martínez-González et al., was completed anonymously by. Results: The study included 160 teachers and 100 residents, with 703 questionnaires being answered. The dimension means were: teacher-resident relationship and motivation 4.66 ± 0.78, methodology 4.58 ± 0.88, evaluation 4.61 ± 0.85, problem solving capacity 4.68 ± 0.81, and subject knowledge 4.68 ± 0.78. Mean overall assessment was 4.64 ± 0.80. Methodology was the dimension with lowest scores. Residents with highest grades evaluated the teacher with higher scores (P =.02). Surgical residents had lower scores than medical residents (4.60 ± 0.84 vs 4.82 ± 0.45, P <.001). Conclusion: Medical teachers obtained a good overall evaluation by the students, although there are areas like methodology and assessment that need improvement. It is recommended to eliminate demographic variables from the evaluation tool, as well allowing to add free comments for each evaluation.Introducción: La evaluación del desempeño docente y —sobre todo— la valoración de sus competencias docentes y clínicas es un proceso vital en las residencias médicas. Con el fin de lograr una adecuada evaluación docente se han propuesto diversos modelos, sin embargo aquellos que involucran la opinión de los alumnos son los más accesibles y completos hasta ahora. Objetivo: Evaluar el desempeño docente a través de la opinión de los residentes por medio de un cuestionario estandarizado que tiene evidencia de validez y confiabilidad. Método: Estudio observacional, transversal. Lugar: hospital de segundo nivel. Se incluyeron las especialidades de medicina interna, cirugía general, anatomía patológica, oftalmología, otorrinolaringología, traumatología, imagenología diagnóstica, anestesiología y ginecología. Se incluyó a todos los docentes y alumnos de las especialidades médicas de un hospital de segundo nivel. Se aplicó el cuestionario de evaluación del desempeño docente desarrollado por Martínez-González et al., de manera anónima. Se eliminaron las variables demográficas y se añadió un comentario libre en cada evaluación. Resultados: Se incluyeron 160 maestros y 100 alumnos. Se realizaron 703 encuestas. La media de cada dimensión fue: relación profesor-residente y motivación 4,66 ± 0,78, metodología 4,58 ± 0,88, evaluación 4,61 ± 0,85, capacidad de solucionar problemas 4,68 ± 0,81, conocimiento de la materia 4,68 ± 0,78. El promedio global fue de 4,64 ± 0,80. La evaluación más baja fue metodología. Los residentes de mayor jerarquía fueron los que evaluaron más alto a los docentes (p = 0,02). Las especialidades quirúrgicas contaron con evaluaciones inferiores que las especialidades médicas (4,60 ± 0,84 vs 4,82 ± 0,45, p = < 0,001). Conclusión: Los docentes cursaron con una buena evaluación global, encontrando como áreas de mejora las dimensiones de metodología y evaluación.

Proactivity is measured by several indicators, such as class attendance, case-study oral presentation and its delivery in a foreign language, all of them being non-mandatory activities for students who have participated in the experiment. Specifically, this study aims to assess the impact of a student’s proactivity on two academic outcomes: (i) to pass or fail the exam; and (ii) the score obtained. Impact assessment has been performed using a probit and ordered multinomial logit models. The results show that a student’s proactivity measured by class attendance and case-study presentation significantly increases the probability of passing the exam, while the impact of using a foreign language seems to be non-significant. In relation to the score obtained, the proactivity measured through the case presentation raises the probability of obtaining a higher mark more than regular class attendance. © 2018 by the authors.

Active video games, active gaming, interactive games, movement-controlled video games, exertion games, and exergaming are terms used to define the kinds of video games in which the exertion interface enables a new experience. Exergames have added a component of physical activity to the otherwise motionless video game environment and have the potential to contribute to physical education classes by supplementing the current activity options and increasing student enjoyment. The use of exergames in schools has already shown positive results in the past through their potential to fight obesity. As for the pedagogical aspects of exergames, they have attracted educators’ attention due to the large number of games and activities that can be incorporated into the curriculum. In this way, the school must consider the development of a new physical education curriculum in which the key to promoting healthy physical activity in children and youth is enjoyment, using video games as a tool. In this context, the aim is to conduct a brief review of the use of exergames in physical education curriculum, exploring school curriculum, digital culture, and motivation and enjoyment for the learning processes in the video game environment. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.All right reserved.","Active gaming; Curriculum; Exergaming; Experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057030986

The analytical methodology is the autobiographic experience, based on the Benjaminian storyteller, and the results are constituted by this experience under analysis within a narrative organized in three moments: (1) the discussions within a group of professors of these courses about the inclusion of such issues in the curriculum; (2) the construction of study plans; and (3) the experiences in the classroom. The narrated process shows that the issues on gender and sexualities, from a scientific perspective (gender and queer studies, and feminisms) are incipient on these courses, unknown to the students, and a challenge to the school.

Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games’ interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children's comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Child-game interaction; Digital games; Programming; Young children",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work is supported by the Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) .

The 5-h handwriting intervention provided students with explicit instruction and intensive practice in writing cursive letters, words, and sentences, through fast-paced alphabet and copying activities. Intervention effects were examined on handwriting fluency, written composition (i.e., text length, clause extension, and story elements), and self-efficacy beliefs. Results showed that the handwriting intervention was highly effective in increasing students’ handwriting fluency. There were also improvements in written composition in terms of clause extension and number of story elements. After the intervention, students also reported strengthened self-efficacy beliefs for grammar and usage skills. Overall, this study showed that handwriting interventions can effectively help students with limited handwriting skills to become fluent handwriters.

During this period, beginning mathematics teachers confront tensions and contradictions among the principles, ideals, and experiences encountered during pre-service education and the demands, and restrictions of their teaching practice in schools. This article approaches this topic by developing an interpretative case study centered on one novice mathematics teacher, Sol. The aim is to describe and understand the development of Sol’s professional identity and agency during her first teaching year. Considering identity development as a diachronic phenomenon, we carry out a narrative analysis of the research data. The findings show that Sol developed her professional identity and agency through a process that gathered together the teaching practices possible inside her school, the positions she could negotiate as a newcomer inside the institution, and the cultural practices and discourses embodied during pre-service education. The results bring to the forefront the profound and tense interactions between the intimate and personal terrain of mathematics teachers and the social and cultural world of the schools where they work. Sol’s case also contributes to understanding the role that a robust pre-service education can play in the development of beginning teachers’ professional identities and in the possibility they could become agents of transformation in their schools. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agency; Beginning mathematics teachers; Narrative analysis; Pre-service teacher education; Professional identity",,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET: 4467/12; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 312929/2013-7","Sol’s first year as a secondary school mathematics teacher was 2013.

Upon the determination that the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions implemented by health personnel overlooked predefined procedures, the National Institute of Public Health, in coordination with the Ministry of Health, immediately designed the massive open online course ""Proper cholera containment and management measures"" to strengthen and standardize basic prevention and control practices. Methods: During the first 5 months, 35,968 participants from across the country finished the course: medical and nursing personnel, health promoters, and hospital staff. To understand the magnitude of the data, an analysis was performed to calculate the MOOC coverage, and multiple linear regression models were generated to relate the score earned in the course to the characteristics of the participants. In addition, a qualitative analysis was performed to identify the dissemination of information, technological barriers, and feedback on course design. A total of 17% of participants were from the state where the outbreak originated, and 33.5% were from its neighboring states. Results: This study shows that the need for information is greater when an emergency occurs, and the involvement of the authorities increased the extent of the training response. Conclusion: A MOOC can be a useful training strategy to prepare personnel for emergency situations. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cholera; Epidemiological emergency; Health training; MOOC","adolescent; adult; aged; cholera; education; emergency; epidemic; female; health care personnel; hospital personnel; human; male; medical staff; Mexico; middle aged; nursing staff; qualitative research; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cholera; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Medical Staff; Mexico; Middle Aged; Nursing Staff; Personnel, Hospital; Qualitative Research; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047209234

An increase in coverage, student population’s heterogeneity and diversity of the educational offer and of the quality of the education provided are described. After the nineties, the Chilean state established control mechanisms and demands for accountability. Consequently, universities developed organisational changes within the non-academic staff, incorporating professionals to administer quality assurance. The study analyses the opinions of these professionals. Data were gathered in two stages; the evidence discussed in this article comes mainly from the second stage, in which 20 quality administrators were interviewed to explore their conceptions of quality in higher education. The most recurring distinctions identified are framed within a conceptual scope that varies between complying with the demands of the external environment and adjusting internally to institutional goals.

In the last decade, significant investment in faculty development, innovative learning methodologies and student engagement has been key milestones in educational improvement at this medical school, harnessed to recent political changes that strengthened community-based and emergency education. This study describes how curriculum changes in UFRN Medical School have been responsible for major improvements in medical education locally and which impacts such transformations may have on the educational community. Methods: A group of students and teachers revised the new curriculum and established the key changes over the past years that have been responsible for the local enhancement of medical education. This information was compared and contrasted to further educational evidences in order to define patterns that can be reproduced in other institutions. Results: Improvements in faculty development have been fairly observed in the institution, exemplified by the participation of a growing number of faculty members in programs for professional development and also by the creation of a local masters degree in health education. Alongside, strong student engagement in curriculum matters enhanced the teaching-learning process. Conclusions: Due to a deeper involvement of students and teachers in medical education, it has been possible to implement innovative teaching-learning and assessment strategies over the last ten years and place UFRN Medical School at a privileged position in relation to undergraduate training, educational research and professional development of faculty staff. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"article; curriculum; human; human experiment; learning; medical education; medical school; medicine; professional development; Rio Grande do Norte; student; teacher; Brazil; education; medical school; medical student; organization and management; problem based learning; program development; psychology; public relations; teaching; Brazil; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Faculty, Medical; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Problem-Based Learning; Program Development; Students, Medical; Teaching","Ministério da Educação, MEC","The Tutorial Education Program, a group composed by students from the second-to the sixth-year funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Education, is another example of such engagement.

Therefore, the program holds the aim of adding supplementary knowledge to medical curriculum by developing extracurricular activities that will help the entire student community on three major areas: extension, which means applying academic knowledge to society; learning, which refers to the development of key professional competencies; and research, especially by stimulating the interest of students and teachers for projects in medical education. Through this group, students are given the opportunity of assisting teachers on core disciplines, such as a module regarding medicine, humanities and arts, and another module approaching evidence-based medicine. Some other projects investigate the use of music in medicine, and also stimulate health behavior and physical activities.

Several factors influence clinicians' inclination towards research: the medical school experience, exposure to research article reading and writing, and knowledge of research. This cohort study follows up medical students at time of graduation to explore changes in their inclination towards research and pursuing a research career compared to their inclination at time of entry into medical school. Methods: Students from medical schools in six different countries were enrolled in their first year of school and followed-up upon graduation in their final year. Students answered the same self-administered questionnaire at both time points. Changes in inclination towards research and pursuing a research career were assessed. Factors correlated with these changes were analysed. Results: Of the 777 medical students who responded to the study questionnaire at entry into medical school, 332 (42.7%) completed the follow-up survey. Among these 332 students, there was no significant increase in inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Students from a United States based school, in contrast to those from schools other countries, were more likely to report having research role models to guide them (51.5% vs. 0%-26.4%) and to have published in a peer-reviewed journal (75.7% vs. 8.9%-45%). Absence of a role model was significantly associated with a decrease in inclination towards research, while an increased desire to learn more about statistics was significantly associated with an increase in inclination towards pursuing a research career. Conclusion: Most medical students did not experience changes in their inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Factors that increased their inclination to undertaking research or pursuing a research career were availability of a good role model, and a good knowledge of both the research process and the analytical tools required. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cohort; Inclination; Medical students; Research; Research career","article; career; cohort analysis; follow up; human; human experiment; major clinical study; medical school; medical student; questionnaire; statistics; United States; adolescent; adult; decision making; education; female; international cooperation; male; medical research; medical student; mentor; personnel; professional standard; prospective study; psychology; research; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomedical Research; Career Choice; Female; Humans; Internationality; Male; Mentors; Professional Role; Prospective Studies; Research; Research Personnel; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046295929

Students face difficulties when they get in contact with searching information tasks, as well as with the topics of the so called academic literacy. Theoretical coincidences suggest the existence of an eloquent difficulty of adaptation to university life, which is compounded when taking into account difficulties in working with information search tools as for reading and writing are the basic and constitutive academic elements of literacy. In the face of this problem, it is essential to consider the benefits that the incorporation of a new academic culture could provide to students. So, the general objective of this study becomes to find the link that can be established between the strategies of information search, reading, and writing, and the capitalization of knowledge at the beginning of the university studies for freshmen students in the Faculty of Elementary and Special Education, University of Cuyo (FEEyE), and the Faculty of Psychology, Children, Youth and Family, and Criminalistics, University of Aconcagua; both are located in Mendoza, Argentine. A structured, quantitative design methodology was implemented to achieve this objective; in this methodology, the survey technique was applied, and a questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument, prepared ad hoc for these studies. The 146 participants selected responded to a non-probabilistic sampling strategy, which considered the two universities under study and the four careers chosen. To apply the strategy the students should be enrolled in the second year of their careers, so that this condition could account for the aspects under research. The data obtained were processed from a descriptive, univariate and bivariate statistics, which would provide a descriptive image of the subjects studied, as well as the main variables and indicators mentioned in the research objectives. Thus, by way of conclusion, regarding the contact with sources of information, it is notable that about 13% of the students of both universities do not use ICTs in their university performance, despite public policies in state institutions executed years ago. One in five students does not know how to look for academic information on Internet; they confuse and do not know the available tools. Concerning the axes of academic literacy, reading and writing, the lack of specific disciplinary language appears as one of the main difficulties both to produce and to understand a text, accompanied by the absence of exercise in the production of academic texts of their own. Despite the initial assumption, no significant differences were found to be attributable to the public and private qualities of the universities where the groups under study were enrolled. © 2018 Universidad Nacional.

This growing interest in debates about such practices suggests that more punctual studies are undertaken, focusing on students as well as on the teacher. It is in this second perspective that this study is inserted. We thus aim to investigate what is revealed of the teacher’s interventions when he orients his students in the development of mathematical modeling activities. For this, we bring some extracts of two modeling activities developed by students of an 8th grade of Elementary School in a public school in the state of Paraná. For data analysis we used audio and video recordings and written records of the students, collected during fifteen classes. As students feel the need to make explicit their way of thinking, to discuss the results they have obtained, be it with the teacher or in the group itself, we infer that the development of modeling activities also depends on the teacher’s mediation. Thus, the dialogues promoted within the group of students that develops the activity and also of them with the teacher, besides promoting a certain mobilization and construction of knowledge, leads them to analyze, at any moment, the process of search for a solution to the problem in study. The results indicate that the interventions carried out by the teacher either indicate ways, or validate the students’ ways of thinking; they either signal that they are performing appropriate actions, or confirm their conclusions. Finally, we identified three categories of teacher’s interventions: questioning, suggesting and clarifying. Such interventions, however, either favor or limit the manifestation of students’ actions, although they do not determine the development of mathematical modeling activities. © 2018 Lutheran University of Brazil.

Our surgical educational website and its associated assets were assessed to understand how such a resource was being used. Design: Our website was accessible to all Mayo Clinic employees via the internal web network. Website access data from April 2015 through October 2016 were retrospectively collected using Piwik. Setting: Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Participants: A total of 257 Mayo Clinic employees used the website. Results: The website had 48,794 views from 6313 visits by 257 users who spent an average of 14 ± 11 minutes on the website. Our website houses 295 videos, 51 interactive modules, 14 educational documents, and 7 flashcard tutorials. The most popular content type was videos, with a total of 30,864 views. The most popular visiting time of the day was between 8 PM and 9 PM with 6358 views (13%), and Thursday was the most popular day with 17,907 views (37%). A total of 78% of users accessed content beyond the homepage. Average visits peaked in relation to 2 components of our curriculum: a 240% increase one day before our biannual intern simulation assessments, and a 61% increase one day before our weekly conducted Friday simulation sessions. Interns who rotated on the service of the staff surgeon who actively endorses the website had 93% more actions per visit as compared to other users. The highest clicks were on the home banner for our weekly simulation session pre-emptive videos, followed by “groin anatomy,” and “TEP hernia repair” videos. Conclusions: Our website acted as a “just-in-time” accessible portal to reliable surgical information. It supplemented the time sensitive educational needs of our learners by serving as a heavily used adjunct to 3 components of our surgical education curriculum: weekly simulation sessions, biannual assessments, and clinical rotations. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","assessments; educational website; faculty endorsement; Medical Knowledge; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; simulation; surgical curriculum; website usage data","Article; curriculum; general surgery; human; Internet; priority journal; simulation; surgical training; tertiary health care; clinical competence; education; female; Internet; male; medical education; Minnesota; organization and management; procedures; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; task performance; time factor; university hospital; videorecording; Academic Medical Centers; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Internet; Internship and Residency; Male; Minnesota; Retrospective Studies; Task Performance and Analysis; Time Factors; Video Recording",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046850241

In this context, each new teaching methodology should be field tested, which can be time consuming. Introducing a simulation that can pre-test methodologies to check their efficiency can assist in the methodological building process.Research questions: The proposed simulation environment helps in understanding the differences in the learning rate of a group of agents (students) with different levels of humanization and instruction.Methodology: Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to build the causal relationship between the students and a PBL methodology, to generate the input data for the simulation. Based on the analysis of the responses to a survey performed over five consecutive semesters, it was possible to generate some cause-effect data parameters to be used as the input for a hybrid type of ABS, known as PLS agent.Findings: The use of the proposed model, based on a computational approach, to study the educational process was validated; the simulation outcomes indicate that higher levels of self-esteem, self-realization, and cooperation result in better learning experiences. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Cooperative learning; electrical engineering; knowledge transfer; simulation; statistics; structural equation modeling","Analytical models; Data structures; Education computing; Electrical engineering; Engineering education; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Mathematical models; Statistics; Students; Computational model; Cooperative learning; Knowledge transfer; simulation; Structural equation modeling; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046839492

Thus, the author proposes that higher education must actively get involved with basic education by implementing remedial programs for unqualified teachers. It also must propose continuous education programs to foster a better preparation of the teaching staff and develop research projects that generate knowledge to promote more comprehensive and better-quality art education.

Since then, a number of countries have implemented these types of parks to develop and revitalize regions, boost high-tech industry sectors, foster greater industry-academia interaction, support new technology-based firms (NTBFs), and encourage academic spin-offs. Although these parks have operated for many years, there is no universally accepted definition in the literature or consensus regarding the contributions of STPs to the region and tenant companies. Using the method proposed by Lage Junior and Godinho Filho (2010), this study analyses 56 articles, indicating their objectives and results and providing guidance on controversial topics, and identifies existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges for future studies. The results suggest that the multiple definitions of STPs make expectations about these parks very high.

In Chile, research on teacher quality has predominantly relied on cross-sectional data, and largely focused on identifying teacher attributes related to teaching quality. Only have few studies addressed the problem of non-random assignment of students to teachers. This paper attempts to fill these gaps. On the basis of pseudo-longitudinal data for 2011 from the Education Quality Measurement System and teachers’ administrative records, we employed value-added and fixed-effect models correcting for sorting-bias, to assess the overall contribution of teachers to student achievement and identify which teacher characteristics enhance teacher effectiveness. We find that teacher contribution to students’ learning in mathematics and language is very significant. In addition, teaching experience has a significant non-linear impact on test scores in math but not in reading. Both junior and senior teachers are effective in the educational system.

The latter was based on the self-determination theory's concepts of differentiation of autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation. Methods: A cross-sectional correlational study was conducted where 924 students completed self-reported questionnaires measuring motivation, perception of the learning climate, feedback and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha scores and bivariate correlations were computed. Mediation of basic needs on each predictor-outcome association was tested based on a series of regression analyses. Finally, all variables were integrated into one structural equation model, controlling for the effects of age, gender and year of study. Results: Cronbach's alpha scores were acceptable (.655 to.905). Correlation analyses showed positive and significant associations between both an autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback received, and students' autonomous motivation, which decreased and became negative when correlated with controlled motivation and amotivation, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that these associations were indirect and mediated by how these predictors satisfied students' basic psychological needs. These results were corroborated by the structural equation analysis, in which data fit the model well and regression paths were in the expected direction. Conclusion: An autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback were positive predictors of students' autonomous motivation and negative predictors of amotivation. However, this was an indirect association mediated by the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs. Consequently, supporting students' needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness might lead to optimal types of motivation, which has an important influence on dental education. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study aims to recognize the limitations of applying a North American rating system considering relevant criteria to a South American university and to emphasize the importance and lack of benchmarks available in the region. Design/methodology/approach: Methodology used for this study is based on the Sustainability Tracking Assessment Rating System (STARS) by AASHE. In December 2013, USFQ joined the Pilot Program that included publicly documenting efforts, sharing feedback and making suggestions for system improvements. Findings: Data collected by USFQ in 2012 and 2013 illustrate how the status of USFQ as a non-residential, teaching university in Ecuador in a developing country had several challenges while using an evaluation system established for universities within a North American system. The limits of assessing sustainability in South America are associated to its geographical location, the number of students and staff that commute to University and the lack of environmental services and certifications available in Ecuador. There are applicability issues with the use of STARS without performance reports from regional peers that can guide the development of relevant benchmarks for future comparability. Originality/value: Little research has been conducted in the assessment and tracking of sustainability within universities in South America. This paper is one of the first to address the applicability of a North American self-reporting tool to a South American university. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benchmark; Campus sustainability; Latin American higher education institutions; South American university; STARS; Sustainability",,"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, USFQ","This research was funded by Universidad San Francisco de Quito¨s Chancellor Grant.

Traditionally, the interaction with DGS is based on keyboard and mouse events where the functionalities are accessed using a menu of icons. Nevertheless, recent findings suggest that such a traditional model of interaction has a steep learning curve and is inadequate to develop DGS for devices with multi-touch screens. Thus, we propose a new interaction model for DGS based on a gesture dictionary which enables the construction and manipulation of geometric objects without the need of accessing a menu of icons. The dictionary is divided into three types: (i) kernel gestures: which are the basis for defining gestures; (ii) navigation gestures: related to the manipulation and editing of geometric objects; and (iii) basic gestures of construction: to construct geometric objects. To validate our interaction model, a DGS for mobile device, GeoTouch, has been developed using the proposed dictionary. Usability tests were performed comparing GeoTouch with three other DGS for mobile devices. The results indicate that the GeoTouch interface has fewer usability problems than the other three DGS software and it is easier to learn and interact with. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","educational technology; gestural interfaces; Interactive geometry; interface design; usability",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2013/07375-0; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 310268/ 2014-1, 470757/2013-2","This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [grant number 310268/ 2014-1, 470757/2013-2]; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo [grant number 2013/07375-0]; Coor-denação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior.","This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient?fico e Tecnol?gico [grant number 310268/2014-1, 470757/2013-2]; Funda??o de Amparo ?

However, collaboration does not occur spontaneously; instead it needs to be guided by appropriate scaffolding. In this study we explore whether a script that explicitly incorporates constructing arguments in collaborative problem-solving activities improves learning. In order to do so, a study was conducted involving 75 students from a lower-middle class state-subsidized private school in Santiago de Chile. These students were divided into three groups, each of which worked on geometry activities over 10 sixty-minute sessions that were held across a period of four weeks. To isolate the effect of incorporating technology, the first of these groups did not work with technology. The second group worked with a collaborative script that was developed for use with a tablet, while the third group used the same technology with an integrated tool that explicitly allowed the students to build arguments. We conclude that having students reflect on their own processes and outcomes by arguing their point of view can lead to an improvement in learning, more so than the technology itself. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Argumentation; collaboration; computer-supported collaborative learning; learning scripts; orchestration",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1150045","This research was funded by FONDECYT/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1150045].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020219925

There are not instruments available to evaluate if these tutors teaching is proven to be reliable. Objective: The aim is to evaluate the psychometric properties of ""Clinic Teachers Assessment Questionnaire (CTAQ)"" in Speech Therapy degree internships in a traditional university in Concepción. Method: Analytical, relational and mixed studies, using surveys. The surveys were answered by 43 students who were selected using a sampling method that was not probabilistic in terms of accessibility. These students carried out 137 reviews using the CTAQ, evaluating 38 tutors. Informed consent was given and it was authorized by the person in charge of the major. Results: An exploratory factor analysis was carried out using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0,95 statistical calculation of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of sphericity c 2 (325)=4092,05; p&lt;0,001. The Kaiser-Guttman criterion was used when estimating the number of factors, identifying three factors with eigenvalues of 16,71, 1,23 and 1,07. These factors displayed reliability with Cronbach's alpha coefficients a=0,97, a=0,93 and a=0,89. They also displayed a direct correlation with the teacher's overall score of that were statistically significant. Conclusions: The CTAQ shows signs of reliability and validity of design and criteria. The CTAQ displays the following factors: ""promotes ongoing dialogue"", ""promotes conditions for safe performance"" and ""teaches techniques"". The CTAQ allows the clinical teachers to be characterized, and enables teaching innovation in the internships. © 2018, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

In this context, the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Federal University of Pernambuco offers three two-wheeled courses: Studies on Bicycles and Motorcycles (45 h, graduate students), Propulsion of Bicycles and Motorcycles (45 h, graduate students), and Motorcycle Engineering (60 h, under graduate students). All of them present a greater or lesser mixture of general topics (e.g. accidents, culture, market, history) and technical ones (e.g., technology description and mathematical modeling). On those courses, the calculations are made using empirical correlations, commercial packages, and also simple methods, which, although quantitatively weaker, have both didactic and theoretical advantages, as they consider the essence of the phenomena and reveal the strongest relations between the variables. In this paper, we present an integrated engine/motorcycle simple model that permits the manipulation of parameters, such as the combustion time, heat losses, drag and inertial resistances, gear shifting and others. Those model parameters are then varied to study their influence on the motorcycle behavior. Manipulating this model, students learn that both engine and motorcycle inefficiencies have the same order of influence on motorcycle economy, ethanol is less volumetrically efficient than gasoline, the change of sprockets can increase the maximal speed while deteriorating the mean speed, and other interesting practical concepts. The success of the courses can be gauged by the students’ enrollment, by the professors’ evaluation by the students, class participation, and by the strong commitment of the students to the final projects. Other highly probable cause for the success is the motorcycle itself, always a passionate subject for young people in general, and mechanical engineers in particular. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Internal combustion engine; motorcycle; vehicle dynamics","Combustion; Engineering education; Heat resistance; History; Internal combustion engines; Motorcycles; Sporting goods; Class participations; Commercial packages; Empirical correlations; Graduate students; Integrated modeling; Model parameters; Strongest relations; Vehicle dynamics; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046745750

This paper addresses this issue by presenting a low-cost real-time networked control system platform, based on custom hardware and software solutions that can be readily explored with the sole use of a web browser connected to the Internet. The technical decisions made during development represent a fundamentally novel take on networked control system experimental platforms that can potentially be reproduced by several universities. The platform provides the user with multiple controller and input reference options, network configurations, delay statistics, and even a downloadable file containing advanced experiment data.

Likewise, the relationship between the influences of contact among students from different professions is still controversial. Objectives: To evaluate whether greater contact among students from diverse health courses could be associated with improved Readiness for Interprofessional Learning (RIPLS) at the undergraduate level and to compare the RIPLS among healthcare courses, analyzing differences among courses and periods of their academic training. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: A Brazilian public university. Participants: Students enrolled in the first and final periods of nine healthcare courses. Methods: The rates of contact between students and the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning were assessed. A comparison between students from these nine healthcare courses was carried out. Results: A total of 545 (73.45%) students answered the questionnaire. The highest RIPLS scores were from Nursing (42.39), Dentistry (41.33) and Pharmacy students (40.72) and the lowest scores were from Physical Education (38.02), Medicine (38.17) and Psychology (38.66) students. The highest rates of contact between students (RC) were from Physical Education, Nutrition and Psychology students and the lowest RC were from Pharmacy, Social service and Dentistry. There was a significant effect of “healthcare course” on RIPLS. Comparing RIPLS and RC between the first and final years we found that, considering all courses, there was an increase in the RC, whereas a decrease in RIPLS scores. No correlation was found between RIPLS and RC in general. Conclusion: The current study found that RIPLS scores are very different between healthcare students. Although we found a significant increase in the RC, there was a decrease in the RIPLS scores. These findings lead to a greater understanding of the difficulties facing and potential for interprofessional education. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Healthcare students; Interprofessional learning; Nursing education; Readiness for Interprofessional Learning","adult; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dentistry; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; nursing education; nutrition; pharmacy student; physical education; questionnaire; social work; Brazil; comparative study; cooperation; health personnel attitude; health student; psychology; public relations; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Brazil; Cooperative Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Learning; Male; Students, Health Occupations; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041647406

This study explores the way Higher Education institutions, as examples of autonomous organisations, respond to a new set of regulatory policies. The analysis of the regulatees shows that university-wide administration has gone beyond the letter of required regulations, toward over-compliance. Far from a stereotype of a main external regulator (accreditation agency) trying to impose the stated regulations and the regulatee simply resisting, the latter adds a kind of self-regulation. Below the university-wide administration, at the programme level—the primary regulatee target of external regulators—matters take more typical, anticipated form. Mixed compliance characterises programme-level responses, including resistance strategies.

Motivated by this claim, a number of studies have set out to determine the tasks that best promote negotiations for meaning (NfMs). However, this research has mostly tended to investigate NfM under experimental conditions, leaving considerably unexplored the negotiated interactions that might take place in real English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms. In response to this, the present study sets out to investigate the incidence and nature of NfM in three uncontrolled EFL classrooms. In examining several teacher-and learner-led speaking tasks at basic, intermediate and advanced levels, the findings indicate that the amount of NfM is lower than those reported in previous studies. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of the interactional data suggests that the NfM across proficiency levels was limited in nature, and thus did not provide learners with all the learning benefits inherent in negotiation for meaning. These findings raise intriguing questions as to teachers' and learners' opportunities to negotiate meaning during EFL classroom interactions, and ways through which they can promote negotiated interactions in their EFL classrooms. © 2018 Journal of Language and Education.All rights reserved.","English as a foreign language; Negative evidence; Negotiation for meaning; Speaking practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062613366

As in other countries, a medical residency is not obligatory to practice as a doctor. In this context, this paper aims to clarify what and when competencies in communication and professionalism should be addressed, shedding light on the role of university, residency and post-residency programmes. Methods: Brazilian family physicians with diverse levels of medical training answered a questionnaire designed to seek a consensus on the competencies that should be taught (key competencies) and when students should achieve them during their medical training. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation tests. Results: A total of seventy-four physicians participated; nearly all participants suggested that the students should achieve communication and professionalism competencies during undergraduate study (twenty out of thirty competencies - 66.7%) or during residency (seven out of thirty competencies - 23.33%). When competencies were analysed in domains, the results were that clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be achieved during undergraduate medical education, and interpersonal communication and leadership skills should be reached during postgraduate study. Conclusion: The authors propose that attainment of clinical communication skills and professionalism competencies should be required for undergraduate students. The foundation for Leadership and Interpersonal Abilities should be particularly formed at an undergraduate level and, furthermore, mastered by immersion in the future workplace and medical responsibilities in residency. © 2018 The Author(s).","Communication; Family physician; Medical education; Primary care; Professionalism","adult; article; Brazilian; communication skill; consensus; female; general practitioner; human; human experiment; immersion; leadership; male; medical education; medical ethics; mental capacity; postgraduate student; professionalism; questionnaire; statistics; undergraduate student; workplace; Brazil; clinical competence; education; general practitioner; interpersonal communication; middle aged; practice guideline; professionalism; psychology; Adult; Brazil; Clinical Competence; Communication; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians, Family; Professionalism; Surveys and Questionnaires","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 13271/13-0; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 229753/2013–2","Thank you to all the family physicians who participated in this research.

The research aimed to understand if ProUni is complying with its objective of creating opportunities to students from vulnerable groups for accessing Higher Education, and if there are differences in the baseline characteristics of ProUni graduates and non-ProUni graduates when admitted in a Higher Education. Using a quantitative approach with explanatory goal, data were analyzed via descriptive and inference statistics. Survey participants included 57 ProUni and 140 non-ProUni graduates; all were already Higher Education graduates from a non-profit institution in Southern Brazil and had accessed this level of education in 2005. The results show that ProUni provided access to Higher Education to a younger group of students than the non-ProUni group. The ProUni group also contained a larger number of women and a higher proportion of nonwhites than the other group. Among ProUni scholarships, 12.28% had a per capita income higher monthly to three minimum wages and had a higher probability of choosing a licentiate/undergraduate degree. The graduates of the non-ProUni group tended to be more motivated by intrinsic factors, while the ProUni group is motivated by extrinsic factors when choosing courses. © 2018, Arizona State University.

Thus, this article explores a didactic activity which utilized robotics in order to investigate significant aspects of kinematics, gathering data and performing analyses and descriptions via graphs and mathematical equations which were indispensable for the analysis of the phenomena in question. Traffic safety appears as a main theme, with particular emphasis on the distinction between braking and stopping distances in harsh conditions, as observed in the robot vehicle's tires and track. This active-learning investigation allows students to identify significant differences between the average value of the initial empirical braking position and that of the vehicle's programmed braking position, enabling them to more deeply comprehend the relations between mathematical and graphic representations of this real phenomenon and the phenomenon itself, thereby providing a sense of accuracy to this study. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041385122

Considering variable trends in mining, academic institutions with geology programs in Chile were analyzed to provide an evaluation of their current state and projected development across the country. Through the compilation of 5 years of data, a comparison was undertaken in relation to the age of the programs, their respective lifespans, geographic distributions, vacancies, annual entry fees, yearly tuitions, scores on admission tests, curricula, and human resources and infrastructure. The main results indicate the following: most of the new programs are located in or near the Metropolitan Region due to population trends rather than the locations of mines, the actual number of new students may double the total amount of vacancies, the student program fee tends to increase with time and varies between the programs with no apparent relationship to quality, there exists a strong variation in scores needed to enter into the geology programs, and currently there are more individuals studying geology than total graduates. When considering the unfavorable projections for mining in Chile, it is conclusive that this career will not yield the anticipated benefits for graduates unless new, more diverse professional opportunities develop in other sectors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chile; Geology program; Higher education; Mining","academic research; educational development; geology; higher education; institutional framework; metropolitan area; mineral deposit; mining; student; Chile","79150070; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 3160843","This work would not be possible without the valuable help of the Group of Education in Geology of the Geological Society of Chile.

Less is known about the prevalence and mental health correlates of teen dating violence in countries like Mexico where adult partner violence is high. Additional research on teen dating violence is also needed, as it may be an important precursor to adult partner violence and linked to other mental health problems. The current study used self-report ratings to assess the similarities and differences in risk factors associated with dating violence among middle school students in Mexico and the United States. The US sample (Nus = 15,099; Mus = 12.8; 49.5% female) included non-Hispanic Caucasian (24.9%), Hispanic American (20.3%), and African American (24.2%) adolescents. The Mexican sample (NMexico = 2211; MMexico = 13.67; 51% female) included 93.1% adolescents of Hispanic or Latin descent. Logistic regressions showed that dating violence victimization was reported at similar rates in the cross-national samples, though exposure to risk factors like deviant peers and substance use differed significantly by country. Our analyses indicated that, although the country of residence was not significantly associated with dating violence victimization, the strength of the association between some known risk factors and dating violence victimization varied as a function of nationality, such that there was a significant interaction between country of residence, Mexico or the US, and experiencing internalizing symptoms on experiencing physical dating violence victimization. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on dating violence, both inside and outside the US. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cross-national study; Intimate partner violence; Mexico; Teen dating violence","adolescent; African American; Caucasian; dating violence; exposure; female; Hispanic; human; human experiment; logistic regression analysis; male; Mexico; middle school student; partner violence; risk factor; self report; substance use; symptom; aggression; comparative study; crime victim; cross-sectional study; drug dependence; high risk behavior; human relation; mental health; Mexico; minority group; partner violence; prevalence; psychology; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; United States; Adolescent; Aggression; Crime Victims; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Intimate Partner Violence; Male; Mental Health; Mexico; Minority Groups; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Risk-Taking; Substance-Related Disorders; United States","U.S. Department of Education, ED; William T.

The ways that students may be able to move geographically in order to access quality higher education within the educational system can be a driver of equality or inequality, depending on who is able to take advantage. Using data from a university census, we examine how demographic indicators of inequality are related to geographic mobility for university attendance, how prior geographic mobility predicts later mobility for university attendance, and how these relationships differ based on the number and quality of universities in a region. Results show that sociodemographic variables related to social inequality explain a substantial amount of students' postsecondary mobility. However, some of these relationships do not operate in the same way in all of the regions. Depending on the availability of universities and their quality, patterns of association between inequality and geographic mobility change.

Three different samples of bleach were taken from a single jar: one from the top, one from the bottom, and a more representative mixture collected by driving a core sampler (a graduated cylinder was found to be appropriate) throughout the full depth of the jar content. The resulting frequency distribution curves (histograms) of the H2O2 titrations with MnO4- presented widely separated maxima for the three samples, while no statistically significant difference was found for the titration of CO32- with HCl. These results intrigue the students, leading them to reflect until they understand that this is due to the presence of a single compound acting as a source of H2O2 (sodium percarbonate), while two ingredients in the formulation of the stratified bleach powder provide CO32- after dissolution.

Starting from the observations that Freire expressed during its visit the author approaches central issues in the debate about youth and adult education, such as the choice for self-learning and social solidarity, the work based on tutorship and the goals in youth and adult education. The analysis about those subjects starts from Paulo Freire's biography and his writings and from a whole of materials gathered during the research stay the author carried out in Mexico City, Chiapas, Puebla and San Luis Potosí between 2014 and 2015. More than 150 adults and youth took part in this research and more than 50 members of the academic staff with coordination, training, didactic material production or tutorship responsibilities. The whole allowed to establish numberless connections between Freire's way of thinking, popular education, the public policies for adult and youth education in Mexico and in other countries of Latin America and the current challenges for materializing the adult and youth education within the National Institute for Adult Education. © 2018 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Sin embargo, tras la inauguración de la unrc y dados a conocer los lineamientos para la política universi-taria aprobados en el Plan Nacional de 1971-1975, el rector del Instituto Nacional del Profesorado Se-cundario, profesor Pais, presentó su proyecto para la creación de la universidad.15 Pais afirmaba que era factible dado que Catamarca contaba con una “estructura básica”: los edificios del Profesorado, la Escuela Agrotécnica ubicada en la localidad de Las Pirquitas, la estación experimental del inta, las es-cuelas de Educación Técnica y la Escuela Provincial de Minería (La Nación, de mayo, 1971: 14).16","Esta última también albergaba Facultades per-tenecientes a otras casas de estudios del país en el territorio provincial,23 y ofrecería algunas carreras vinculadas con el desarrollo,24 aunque la estructura departamental quedaría organizada en tres áreas: Ciencias Básicas, Ciencias Sociales y Tecnología y Producción (Ledesma, 2011: 78-9). Tras la sanción de la Ley 20 364, comenzó a funcionar como una institución independiente. La misma no estuvo con-templada en el plan original de Taquini, y tampoco formó parte del Plan Nacional de 1971-1975. Sin embargo, logró insertarse entre las nuevas universi-dades nacionales que se crearon en los primeros años de la década, contando, a su vez, con el apoyo del decano de Farmacia y Bioquímica.","15 En el mismo se contemplaba la creación de las facultades de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación, las cuales contarían con insti-tutos de investigaciones regionales, y escuelas universitarias de arte y de educación para la puna, y la alta montaña; de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales, con institutos de estudios climáticos, y atmosféricos, de sismología, de estadísticas y observatorio astronómico; de Agrotécnica Regional, con institutos de investigación de edafología y ecología; de la Aridez del Agua y de Recursos Naturales, agro y zootécnicos; y de Ingeniería Industrial, con institutos de investigaciones mineras y de tecnología regional.","Como mencionamos, el Plan Nacional de Desarro-llo y Seguridad 1971-1975 proyectaba valerse de los informes y diagnósticos recientemente publicados para dar una solución a lo que ya se conocía como “problema universitario”.9 En este sentido, se pro-ponía expandir y democratizar el sistema educativo en todos sus niveles, modernizar el sistema en sus estructuras, currículos y funcionamiento, diversifi-car la educación y generalizar la capacitación pro-fesional y técnica de acuerdo con las necesidades de desarrollo, integrar el sistema educativo nacional y descentralizar la administración educativa, entre","El proyecto proponía crear una universidad “nue-va” y distinta a las consideradas “grandes”. La mis-ma tendría un perfil “modesto”, sería “funcional” y tendría un fuerte impulso “regional”, atendiendo no sólo a las necesidades de su provincia, sino también a La Rioja, Santiago del Estero y el sur de la pro-vincia de Tucumán (Comisión Nacional de Estudio de Factibilidad de la Universidad Nacional de Cata-marca, 1971). Finalmente, con la sanción del decreto 19 832, la unca fue creada sobre la base de tres institutos preexistentes. Se procuraba conformar un centro de formación y desarrollo científico que po-tenciara el campo productivo de la región. El primer ciclo lectivo comenzó en 1973 con una oferta de materias que se repartían en tres departamentos, además del Instituto del Profesorado: el de Ciencias Aplicadas y Tecnológicas, el de Ciencias Agrarias y el de Enfermería Universitaria.","29 Dicho informe proponía organizar la nueva casa de estudios en cinco departamentos y dos escuelas. Entre los primeros se encontra-ban el de Ciencias Exactas, Ciencias Naturales, Ciencias de la Educación, Ciencias Sociales y Ciencias Tecnológicas; entre las segundas, se proyectaba la Escuela de Enfermería y la de Graduados del Instituto de Desarrollo Regional. Asimismo, el ciclo académico se orga-nizaría en diferentes etapas, que iban desde la admisión hasta el doctorado.","En este sentido, el golpe de Estado de 1966 no detuvo más que momentáneamente los impulsos por avanzar en un proceso de modernización, ya que la política represiva descargada sobre las universidades fue la principal característica del Onganiato (1966-1970).8 Bajo el mandato de Lanusse (1971-1973), sin embargo, se implementaría un nuevo intento por avanzar con el proceso, esta vez en el marco del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo y Seguridad 1971-1975.","12 Tanto el primer plan quinquenal en la década de los cincuenta como los planes de desarrollo de principios de los sesenta y el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo y Seguridad que pujaba por ser implementado en los inicios de la década de los setenta, entre otros, pusieron el foco en el interior del país, proponiendo proyectos económicos en los diferentes polos de desarrollo, muchos de los cuales estaban pensados regionalmente.","14 Así, la unlz comenzó a funcionar ofreciendo las carreras de licenciatura en Administración, Ingeniería Rural y Comunicación Social, las cuales pertenecían a las facultades de Ciencias Económicas, Ingeniería y Ciencias Agrarias, y Ciencias Sociales, respectiva-mente. La unlu, por su parte, dividiría su oferta académica en dos grandes áreas de investigación científica, la primera relacionada con los problemas de la producción, transformación y comercialización de los productos del agro, con especial referencia a las Ciencias de la Alimentación; y la segunda se hallaría orientada a las Ciencias Sociales, poniendo especial énfasis en las problemáticas de minori-dad y familia (Comisión Pro Universidad Nacional de Luján, 1971). De este modo, se excluyeron las carreras tradicionales en favor de otras como Tecnología Educativa, Producción Animal y Vegetal, Educación a Distancia y Permanente, Transformación de Alimentos, Docencia en Adultos, Administración de Cooperativas, algunas de ellas con la intención de expedir títulos intermedios (Bottarini y Demergasso, s/f). En este marco, la unlu dio comienzo a su ciclo lectivo en 1973, con una oferta académica que se distribuía en cuatro departamentos: Transformación de Alimentos, Producción, Social, y Educacional (Ley 20 031).","30 La misma fue erigida sobre la base de las unidades académicas pertenecientes a la unne y a la unlp, aquellas de gestión pública dependientes del gobierno de la provincia, y el Instituto de Administración de Empresas, de gestión privada. Asimismo, se creó la Facul-tad de Ciencias Sociales, y en 1974 se incorporó el Instituto Superior del Profesorado en Disciplinas Estéticas de Oberá y en la misma ciudad se creó la Facultad de Ingeniería Electromecánica. 31 La creación de la universidad de Jujuy fue solicitada en 1971, y se aprobó con la condición de que las autoridades provinciales enfren-taran los gastos con su propio presupuesto, y que en el término de un año la universidad pasaría a manos de la nación (unju, 2004).","La creación de nuevas universidades nacionales durante los últimos años de la autoproclamada “Revo-lución Argentina” (1966-1973) fue la culminación de un largo proceso que atravesó las tres presidencias del gobierno militar e involucró a diferentes actores sociales. A partir de 1968 se había dado a conocer una serie de diagnósticos sobre el sistema de educa-ción superior, al tiempo que se presentaban diversas propuestas para resolver los problemas que lo afec-taban. En estas últimas no sólo estuvieron involu-crados organismos nacionales, como el Consejo de Rectores de Universidades Nacionales (crun) y el Sector Educación del Consejo Nacional de Desarro-llo y Seguridad (conade), sino también miembros de la comunidad académica, entre los cuales destaca el proyecto del decano de Farmacia y Bioquímica de la Universidad de Buenos Aires (uba), doctor Alberto Taquini y su equipo. No es nuestra intención dete-nernos en estos trabajos, que ya han sido abordados por otros autores (Balán, Kent, y Navarro, 1998; De Luca, 2008; Rovelli, 2008; De Luca y Alvarez Prie-to, 2013; Mendonça, 2015b), pero sí quisiéramos po-ner de relieve la existencia de un debate en torno a la posibilidad de crear nuevas casas de estudio. Si bien los organismos nacionales sólo consideraron crear nuevas instituciones en algunos casos excepcionales, Taquini y su equipo, en cambio, presentaron su pro-yecto titulado “Nuevas universidades para un nuevo país” en el cual proponían crear cinco nuevas casas de estudio distribuidas a lo largo del territorio nacional. Este último proyecto fue publicado en los diarios más importantes de tirada nacional, provo-cando reacciones por parte de las poblaciones de las ciudades que se sugerían para emplazar nuevas universidades.","5 La propuesta de Taquini y su equipo se popularizó rápidamente tras ser publicada en un diario de tirada nacional. No sólo se realizaron numerosos reportajes, sino también se llevaron a cabo movilizaciones en distintas localidades en vistas de conseguir la aprobación del Ministerio de Educación y del gobierno nacional (Mendonça, 2015). Asimismo, en las actas de las reuniones mensua-les realizadas por el crun, también es posible encontrar discusiones en torno a qué hacer con esta posible política universitaria. Por último, cabe mencionar las distintas instancias que atravesó la idea de crear nuevas universidades nacionales, entre los organismos oficiales (Rovelli, 2008).","Al igual que la nacionalización del Comahue, la universidad provincial de San Juan “Domingo Faus-tino Sarmiento”19 aparecía en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, aunque no se proyectaba nacionalizarla sino apenas darle validez nacional a los títulos ofre-cidos. Sin embargo, la presión de las “fuerzas vivas” y el apoyo del gobierno provincial derivaron en su nacionalización.20 Al sancionarse la Ley 20 367 en mayo de 1973, la Universidad Nacional de San Juan (unsj) comenzó a funcionar sobre la base de la Uni-versidad Provincial y otras facultades e institutos preexistentes.21 La nueva institución comenzó así su ciclo lectivo con una oferta que se distribuía en tres facultades y un Instituto de Profesorado.","La provincia de Entre Ríos, por su parte, alojaba algunas unidades académicas universitarias pertene-cientes a la Universidad Nacional del Litoral.26 Pese a ello, en el Plan Nacional aprobado en mayo de 1971, sólo se hacía mención al reconocimiento a nivel na-cional de los títulos expedidos por la Universidad Privada de Concepción del Uruguay. Sin embargo, el entonces gobernador interventor comenzó a gestio-nar la creación de una universidad en su provincia.27 El propósito del brigadier Fabre era “crear una Uni-versidad de Frontera que [fortaleciera] culturalmen-te la región del río Uruguay”, para lo cual solicitó el apoyo del ministro de Educación y la constitución de la Comisión para el Estudio de Factibilidad. Finalmen-te, en mayo de 1973 se dio inicio al ciclo lectivo de la nueva universidad. A diferencia de las otras casas de estudio creadas en estos años, la uner se escin-dió de la unl, pero no creó inmediatamente nuevas unidades académicas. Por el contrario, a partir de las estadísticas del gobierno nacional es posible obser-var que algunas de las instituciones, como es el caso de la Escuela de Enfermería, no formaron parte de la nueva universidad. Asimismo, tampoco adoptó el modelo departamental, sino que se organizó desde el principio con el sistema tradicional de cátedras. Pese a haberse escindido de la unl, y creado en el marco del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo y Seguridad, no adoptó las características que este suponía. En este sentido, Villaruel et. al. (1997: 45), sostienen que el Estudio de Factibilidad de esta casa de estudios tenía un punto que lo diferenciaba de los demás: hacía especial referencia a la ubicación geográfica de la provincia, consideran-do que la misma era una “zona de frontera” y adver-tía que al mantenerla “culturalmente vacía” podría constituirse como “una grave debilidad geopolítica en un punto vital para la defensa nacional”.","Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051033379

The B'More Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK) trial worked at multiple levels of the food environment, including carryouts, to increase access to and demand for healthy, affordable foods. The objective of this article is to describe the development and implementation of BHCK's carryout intervention. Process evaluation was conducted to assess intervention reach (number of interactions with youth and adults either in person or on social media), dose delivered (number of food samples and promotional materials distributed, social media posts and meetings with owners) and fidelity (availability of promoted items). Overall, the carryout intervention showed moderate to optimal reach, moderate to optimal dose delivered and moderate to optimal fidelity. These findings demonstrate a successfully implemented carryout intervention in a low-income urban setting.

We wanted to know whether misconceptions, or strongly held incorrect beliefs, differed by subject area or question type. Methods: A total of 104 students completed two assessments that included 20 MCQs on endodontics and 20 MCQs on dental implants. On each examination, 10 questions were scenario-type questions requiring interpretation or analysis and 10 questions were factual-based, knowledge questions. Incorrect responses and confidence levels by student and subject were recorded for a comparison of average misconceptions by question type and for correlations between scenario and knowledge question types for misconceptions on both assessments. Results: Students were overly confident on their incorrect responses and misconceptions for both assessments. On the endodontic examination, students held a statistically significant higher number of mean misconceptions on scenario questions than for knowledge questions, but the difference was not statistically significant for the dental implant examination. There was a moderately weak relationship between scenario and knowledge questions for misconceptions on the endodontic (r=.31) and dental implant (r=.20) assessments, suggesting students who have misconceptions on knowledge questions are somewhat more likely to have misconceptions on scenario questions. Conclusion: Students had a consistent rate of overconfidence (75%) in their incorrect responses regardless of question type or dental subject. Questions that prompted a higher per cent of incorrect responses were more likely to detect misconceptions, as students were highly confident in their mistakes, for both assessments. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We claim that analysis (and design) of e-textbooks requires the development of a specific frame. Digital affordances provide particular opportunities (e.g. in terms of interactions between users) that require specific considerations for their analysis, as teachers and students use them for their individual and collective purposes. In this study, we develop a framework for mathematics e-textbook analysis, based on the notion of “connectivity.” We introduce criteria to assess the different aspects of connectivity and build an analysis grid for e-textbooks. We illustrate the framework proposed by analyzing 2 commonly used French grade 10 mathematics e-textbooks. The results of the analyses show that there are major differences between the 2 e-textbooks in terms of connectivity, which can be related to differences in their design. Beyond these 2 examples, we claim that focusing on connectivity is a useful and relevant way of analyzing e-textbooks, as it can provide a window into issues of interactivity, both practically and cognitively. © 2016, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Connectivity; Design; Digital resources; E-textbooks; Mathematics textbooks",,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: ANR-13-APPR-0006-02",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001132483

Within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, this step is approached using the study and research paths for teacher education (SRP-TE), an inquiry-based process combining practical and theoretical questioning of school mathematical activities. We present a research study focusing on the design and analysis of an online and distance-learning course for in-service mathematics teachers based on the SRP-TE methodology. This course starts from the initial question of how to analyse, adapt and integrate a learning process related to mathematical modelling and how to sustain its long-term development. Our analysis is based on a case study consisting in four successive editions of a course for Latin American in-service mathematics teachers held at the Centre for Applied Research in Advanced Science and Technology in Mexico. The starting point is a modelling activity about forecasting the number of Facebook users, which includes functional modelling and regression.

Pre-service teachers developed these projects within a regular mathematics education course during the teacher education program at the university concerned. This environment, called a modelling scenario, is the context for our study, which is based on the analysis of projects produced by seven consecutive cohorts of pre-service teachers beginning in 2010. The research questions guiding our study seek to determine which technologies pre-service teachers chose, for which modelling purposes they chose them, and in which phases of the modelling process they were significantly used. During the modelling process, pre-service teachers used the Internet, spreadsheets, mathematical software and programming languages. The Internet, the most utilized technology, was used to find information or data, to select variables, or to formulate problems. The other three technologies significantly influenced the processes of mathematical solution and validation. The in-depth analysis of a single project shows an original use of visual affordances of technologies and a dialectical relationship between problem posing and technology use. The study enables us to conclude the necessity for coordinated action between mathematics educators and mathematicians to generate a deeper understanding of modelling as a pedagogical proposal and mathematical activity. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2018.","Digital technologies; Mathematical modelling scenario; Pre-service mathematics teachers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055720479

The mathematical modelling of successive variation in mathematics and science is addressed through the interpretation of graphs in two cases of different nature: the diagnosis of a cardiologist on the health of a patient (a non-deterministic phenomenon) and the arguments of high school students facing the task of filling containers (a deterministic phenomenon). An emerging theory in the field of mathematics education—the socioepistemological theory—explains the problem of construction of mathematical knowledge. The constructs of this theory are elaborated with an empirical basis; and the legitimacy of all forms of knowledge is assumed, be this knowledge popular, technical or scientific, since all of them constitute human wisdom.

Previously, these mathematics teacher education students had no opportunity to study in higher education in Brazil. They were enrolled in a Mathematical Modelling course, as part of the Universidade Aberta do Brasil (UAB), which is the Brazilian open university, at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP). All stages of this study were performed in accordance with case study methodological procedures, which covered data collection and analysis. The interpretation of the results was accomplished through the development of categories, which emerged from collected qualitative data at the completion of the fieldwork. These procedures helped the researchers to answer the research question: How can technological resources available in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) help students to interact and collaboratively develop mathematical modelling projects that assist them in solving problems they face in daily life? One important claim for mathematical modelling in a VLE is to favor the development of students in their interaction and collaboration in solving problems they face daily, by elaborating modelling projects through the use of technological resources available in this environment. By developing these projects, students learned to problematize, contextualize, and investigate problems. As well, they prepared questions that aimed to seek, collect, select, organize, and handle the information that allowed them to reflect critically about the role of mathematics in their own context. The results from this study show that the development of modelling projects in a VLE helped students to interact and collaboratively inquire and investigate their chosen theme in accordance with their own interests and reality. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2018.","Case study; Mathematical modelling; Mathematical models; Modelling projects; Virtual learning environments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053451411

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the socioeconomic status of high-school students, as indicated by their attendance at private or state schools, on their knowledge of native plants. In total, 321 students aged 15–18 were asked to write down 10 plants native to Córdoba, Argentina, in a freelist questionnaire. Students listed a mean of 6.8 species of a total of 165 different categories of plant names. The majority of the species named were exotic to Córdoba (63%) or Argentina (50.6%, of which 33.8% were adventitious), indicating an ‘adventitious-to-native’ effect by which all spontaneously reproducing plants were presumed to be native species. However, the 20 most frequently named plants were mainly native, with ‘Algarrobo’ (Prosopis spp.) and ‘Espinillo’ (Vachellia caven) being the most mentioned. Students’ socioeconomic status had a significant effect on the number of species named, with the students of state schools (where the less well-off sectors of the society attend) mentioning more species and, among these, more native ones than the students from private schools. Furthermore, we defined size, colour and scent as being conspicuous traits of plant flowers that are relevant for human perception, and found that the most frequently named adventitious species, unlike the native ones, were those exhibiting big brightly-coloured flowers which ranged from being inodorous to having medium intensity scents. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biological diversity; Botany teaching; floral traits; plant blindness; school sector",,"Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, UNC; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT: PICT-2011-13799, PICT-2015-1903; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, SECYT","We wish to thank all students and teachers for their collaboration.

Nineteen classrooms from Santiago de Chile participated (10 intervention, 9 control). Twice a week, intervention teachers filled out a checklist to monitor the language stimulation they offered children. Research personnel used the checklists to elaborate a monthly summary of the language opportunities offered to each child in that month and discussed this information with teachers. Results revealed a significant advantage for intervention teachers in frequency of book readings and word discussions but not on children’s language growth. Dosage analyses showed that children identified by the self-monitoring device as receiving more language-learning opportunities improved significantly more from beginning to end of the school year in receptive vocabulary. Practice or Policy: Contextual barriers such as large numbers of children and unawareness of the impact of some language interactions can prevent teachers from engaging in important practices. Reminding teachers of the importance of those practices and helping them monitor their frequency may be a low-cost way of improving language opportunities for children in contexts where more intensive professional development is not possible. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013961415

También fortalece el trabajo conjunto de los equipos académicos, puede dibujar el perfil científico de un país y ayuda a definir una política en ciencia y tecnología.","Los investigadores académicos tienen la necesidad de publicar los resultados de sus trabajos, para lo cual existen múltiples razones. Cargill y O´Connor (2009) apuntan varias de ellas: por este medio, los académicos comparten ideas y resultados con sus colegas; dejan constancia escrita de sus trabajos de investigación, que al sumarlos a otros, fortalecen el monto de conocimientos de una sociedad; reciben reconocimiento de parte de la comunidad académi-ca a sus ideas y resultados; atraen el interés de otros académicos hacia sus proyectos y área de conocimiento; toman retroalimentación para el mejora-miento de sus trabajos; legitiman su investigación; tienen acceso a revistas importantes donde investigadores de su mismo campo de interés publican y exponen sus experiencias; reciben correspondencia de diferentes partes del mundo; desarrollan habilidades para la búsqueda de información y presen-tación de la misma. Claudio (2016:18) dice que son ocho las principales ra-zones que tiene un académico para realizar una publicación científica: 1) po-ner sus resultados en papel ayuda a entender las metas de la investigación, permite interpretar los datos de mejor manera y facilita comparar su trabajo con otros; 2) la revisión por pares brinda una importante retroalimentación que posibilita validar la investigación y mejorar las siguientes etapas del tra-bajo; 3) comunicar la información encontrada ayuda a otros investigadores a avanzar en su trabajo y fortalecer el conocimiento existente en el campo; 4) poner la investigación en contexto define núcleos y fronteras de acción en un campo del conocimiento; 5) mejora el entendimiento público acerca del tema de investigación; 6) permite avanzar en la carrera académica a través de reconocimientos y promociones; 7) ayuda a convertirse en un experto en el campo del conocimiento: 8) la evaluación por pares brinda evidencia para to-mar decisiones en cuanto a fondos de investigación. Estas razones, Debnath y Venkatesh (2015: 107) las resumen en cinco puntos: 1) la publicación brinda la oportunidad de compartir pensamientos e ideas con el resto de la comunidad científica, quien ayuda a mejorar la perspectiva científica del artículo y el nivel de conocimiento en él comprendido; 2) ayuda a difundir el conocimien-to entre los pares académicos; 3) proporciona un sentido de responsabilidad cumplida ante la sociedad de parte del investigador; 4) impulsa la formación y la carrera del investigador; 5) apuntala el crecimiento de la ciencia ya que el futuro de ésta depende, en gran parte, de la difusión de las contribuciones científicas. En México existen motivaciones especiales para lograr una publi-cación, entre ellas, los investigadores publican para mejorar el puntaje en los estímulos en sus universidades, para integrarse y permanecer en el Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (sni), lograr el grado de profesor con perfil de- seable del Programa de Desarrollo Profesional Docente (Prodep); mejorar el grado de consolidación de los cuerpos académicos y buscar la acreditación de los programas de académicos donde laboran.","En el campo internacional, los diferentes rankings de universidades consi-deran la publicación y la citación como principales elementos a evaluar; así, en el Academic Ranking World Universities (arwu), al menos el 60% del puntaje lo basa en estas actividades al establecer los siguientes porcentajes en su marco de referencia: investigadores altamente citados en 21 categorías temáticas dife-rentes, 20%; artículos publicados en las revistas Nature y Science, 20%; artículos publicados en las revistas del Índice de Citas Expandido y en el Índice de Ci-tas en Ciencias Sociales de la Web of Science, 20%. Por lo tanto, el 60% del peso de este ranking se ubica en las publicaciones; cabe aclarar que otros indicadores también están relacionados con dicha actividad, como los premios Nobel y Me-dallas Fields obtenidas por los académicos y ex alumnos de las universidades.

The aim of this research was to measure the relation between the work done on the Khan-Academy technology platform and the students’ academic performance achieved in the subject Differential Calculus, in a sample of 175 students from a Higher Education Institution in Santander – Colombia. The methodology was quantitative with the use of Pearson’s coefficient of multiple correlation and the ANOVA technique. The results show that students who used the platform improved their grades after working on out-of classroom practical exercises and before they took their written exams. Through Pearson’s coefficient, a positive and significant correlation between the variables group, dominates, earned points and final grade of r=.50 (p-value <.000) is observed. This indicates that with greater use of the platform, students’ grades are progressively increased. Moreover, the ANOVA demonstrates significant differences between the gender variable and the final grade got (p <.000). Finally, it can be concluded that Khan-academy is a useful tool in the teaching of Differential Calculus that demands the incorporation of information technologies in the educational processes to promote the development of mathematical skills and to assure the quality in higher education. © 2018, Universidad Central de Venezuela.

Thus, the purpose of this research is to characterize the knowledge in use in the measurement of inaccessible distances in Johann Stöffler's Elucidatio Fabricoe Ususque Astrolabii, published in 1513. The theoretical model used considers the study of the constitution of knowledge through the analysis of its genesis, development and transversality. The results reveal in the analyzed work an episteme of the measurement of inaccessible distances that includes both the search for a suitable reason to carry out the measurement and the dynamic analysis of the behavior of the shadows or the visual rays in the estimation of inclinations. This episteme is critical for the understanding of this mathematical knowledge in problem solving. © 2019 Revista Latinoamericana de Investigacion en Matematica Educativa.

To that end, we use data from PISA, TERCE, and TIMSS, as they operationalize socio-economic status somewhat differently. As part of our analysis, we examine whether TERCE, a Latin American study – with measures that are regionally developed – exhibits better psychometric properties than measures that are designed to function across a larger and more diverse number of educational systems. We also examine TIMSS, a trends focused study – that has historically emphasized consistency and comparison. Finally, we include PISA which has the largest number of participants and has changed and conceptualized a great deal of its background questionnaire depending on the study’s major domain and focus.

Early math skills play an important role in the school performance of children, causing substantial differences in future learning gains. Specifically, the tasks proposed by preschool teachers have been shown to have had a differential impact on the development of children’s mathematical thinking. In this way, it is important to determine the type and extent of math tasks teachers employ, using a sample of preschoolers from Latin America, where these topics have been less studied. Consequently, this article explores the different math tasks proposed by early childhood educators in Chilean preschool classrooms. METHOD. We analyzed 31 videos of Chilean preschool classrooms to identify the mathematical tasks implemented and the time invested in each. RESULTS. The results show that, in the observed classrooms, the educators favored numerical content tasks, such as number recognition and number-quantity correspondence, instead of those tasks that required the understanding of math processes. DISCUSSION. The results show that the mathematical tasks that were present in the observed preschool Chilean classrooms focused on mechanical and procedural work, tasks that hinder – to a certain extent – the development of more complex mathematical thinking. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Early childhood educators; Early education; Math tasks; Mathematics; Mathematics Education; Preschool",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064720150

Currently, teacher training at all levels is considered as a subject under permanent study. Nevertheless, little research has concentrated on what knowledge prospective Early Childhood Education teachers have of their mathematical skills. In this study, it is sought to characterize the initial mathematical knowledge of future teachers of early childhood education, when faced with the analysis about symmetry in school tasks. METHOD. An ethnographic case study is conducted with a group of future teachers of Early Childhood Education. A professional task is designed based on the reflection upon symmetry in school situations and the pupils’ answers. We analyze future teachers’ written productions from the perspective of noticing competence, focusing on the analysis of identifying mathematical notions and properties. RESULTS. Three levels of understanding of symmetry are identified. Future teachers who are at the high level recognize at least three properties of symmetry. At the middle level (where most of the future teachers of the study are situated), one or two properties are identified, basically justifying the idea of symmetry as a pattern of visual repetition and the change of orientation of the figures. At the low level the future teachers recognize symmetry as a repetition of shapes and color. In general, there are difficulties in recognizing all the properties of symmetry. CONCLUSIONS. In relation to the identification of the relevant mathematical elements in the proposed professional task, it is observed that very few educators identify symmetry as a point-to-point transformation, confusing sometimes the bilateral symmetry with central symmetry and evidencing difficulties in recognizing all the properties that define symmetry. In particular, future teachers do not identify neither the symmetry axe as invariant of the transformation nor as involutive movement. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Early Childhood Education; Mathematical knowledge; Symmetry; Teaching competence",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT","Esta investigación ha sido financiada por la Co-misión Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología de Chile, (CONICYT) en el marco del programa: Becas Chile.

The foundation of mathematical pedagogical knowledge that a teacher must have is based in a special way on the knowledge he/she has about the contents of the subject. The objective of this paper is the elaboration of a diagnostic test of mathematical abilities, based on the selection and adaptation of some of the items of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011, as well as the technical aspects from the application of the Rasch model. METHOD. The items of the elaborated test were selected following the original structure of blocks of content and cognitive domain established in the framework of the official TIMSS 2011 test (Mullis, Martin, Ruddock, O’Sullivan, & Preuschoff, 2009). The translation and adaptation procedure has been developed in order to ensure greater linguistic validity. The study was carried out with a sample of 477 students enrolled in the first year of the different Bachelordegrees of Primary Education School Teacher that are offered in universities across the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain). RESULTS. We considered two types: multiple-choice items and constructed response items. Given the characteristic of the format it has been necessary to assess the reliability of the correction made by the evaluators to guarantee the agreement in their correction. DISCUSSION. The Rasch model used for the validation of the test has allowed us to generate evidence that shows a high degree of reliability, pointing out the differences in behavior between the multiple-choice items and the constructed response items (elements that require students to construct their own written response). The model allowed us to classify the results of the items by level of difficulty, which facilitates an interpretation of the results according to both the content domain and the cognitive domain. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Assessment adaptation; Mathematical competence; Pre-service teacher preparation; Rasch model; TIMSS",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064686682

The development of arithmetic competence is a key component of the school curriculum and an essential factor in daily life. An adequate understanding of how numerical cognition develops in the first years of formal education, as well as the cognitive bases that underpin this process, is fundamental both for the design of effective educational practices and for the diagnosis of children with learning difficulties in math. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the knowledge about arithmetic development at the school stage. This article analyses the independent contribution of phonological processing, vocabulary, working memory and the Approximate Number System (ANS) in the performance of the calculation in general in the school stage. METHOD. A sample of 679 students from 3rd to 6th grade in the city of Montevideo was evaluated. A multilevel regression was carried out in order to analyze the specific contribution of phonological processing, vocabulary, approximate number system and working memory in the performance of arithmetic calculation. RESULTS. The findings of this study show that working memory, phonological processing, vocabulary and the approximate number system contribute independently to calculation fluency, being the linguistic skills (vocabulary and phonological processing) the ones that explain the greater proportion of the variance of the performance in arithmetic calculation.

The article presents a study on the framework of Geometrical Paradigms and the Theory of Didactic Situations, when we consider the mathematical object orthogonal symmetry. This resulted in an articulation between the two theoretical frameworks cited. The proposal of an articulation between the theoretical frameworks arose from the need to analyze the nature of the geometric work developed by teachers in the moments of resolution and problem situations, by students in the moments of interaction with these problem situations and, the interactions established between the teacher, the student and the knowledge. As a result of this study, we pointed out that this articulation can serve as support for the analysis of data coming from learning situations in the field of geometry teaching, since it proposes the analysis of the data, focusing on the teaching activity, but, taking as reference the phases of learning. © 2018 Lutheran University of Brazil.

In Sergipe, the participation of this professional in the labor market is a challenge, due to the reduced number of occupational therapists in the state. Objective: To characterize the labor market of occupational therapists in Sergipe and to comprehend the perception of professionals in this market. Method: This is a cross-sectional study involving 25 occupational therapists registered in the occupation council, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The descriptive analysis used tabulation in Microsoft Excel worksheet, and the qualitative analysis was performed through the analysis of the speech and identification of the words and key ideas. Results: The labor market of Occupational Therapy in Sergipe is growing despite insertion challenges in the state. Mental health is the main area of work for occupational therapists in Sergipe. Although a significant number of professionals are satisfied with the conditions and infrastructure offered to them, the greatest difficulties cited are related to inadequate physical space and lack of materials.

The documentary corpus consisted of 295 texts published in the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo from 1997 to 2004, which were disposed of at least one describer, previously established. By bringing back some stories told by the newspaper, it was possible to identify an increase in the number of enrollments of the target population of Special Education in regular education, with an emphasis on the exposition of successful experiences of school inclusion in private schools, whereas, in the case of public schools, problems and challenges were portrayed.

A qualitative approach was used through case studies, where participants attended courses aimed at challenging their epistemological beliefs and encouraging them to reflect on them. The tools used were closed questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. We were able to identify that it is an intensive teaching experience that allows the creation and consolidation of epistemological beliefs, that undergraduate programs are a stage in which the epistemological beliefs previously formed in school are permanently adjusted, and that the training received, both implicit and explicit, is difficult and slow to assimilate. It was also possible to establish that the epistemological beliefs of pre-service and in-service teachers are in constant confrontation. This enables both initial and continuing education programs to have a more effective and explicit influence on their construction or transformation.

We discuss the importance of considering the meanings of the terms in the indigenous languages and in Spanish when teaching mathematics to indigenous children who are monolingual or with varying degrees of bilingualism. We point out the importance of recognizing that the mathematical terms they are taught in school have different meanings with regards to the terms and concepts of their culture, namely: (1) they do not always have the same meanings as those from indigenous cultures; (2) sometimes these terms have clearly distant meanings; and (3) other times they have no equivalent in those languages. We question the use of free translations or automatic loanwords from Spanish when teaching mathematics, since such practice disregards the varying uses and specific meanings of words in the different languages. We propose, then, to “harmonize” the terms as an element that contributes to the understanding of mathematics inside the classroom.

The objective of this work is to reveal if this gap is explained by a greater efficiency of private schools or if it is, on the contrary, exclusively due to exogenous factors, such as the social origin of the student and the socioeconomic composition of the students in the school. For this, the data of PISA 2015 are used and the results of the assessment of Science, Mathematics and Reading are analyzed with multilevel regression models with two levels: school and student. The results indicate that when the difference between both types of school is controlled by this set of indicators, it vanishes in the three evaluated subjects. It is concluded that these differences are totally explained by exogenous factors to the school and that certain methodological aspects regarding the construction of indicators to be used, are of special importance in order to reveal the determinants of that inequality.

En un análisis de los datos del Segundo y del Tercer Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo (SERCE y TERCE) de la UNESCO, se ha demostrado no solo el alto poder explicativo de los factores extra-escolares (Cervini, 2012; Cervini, Dari y Quiroz, 2016; Duarte, Bos y Moreno, 2009), sino también que el mayor efecto de los indicadores del nivel socioeconómico del alumno individual se verifica en la varianza entre-escuela y no como era esperable, en la varianza intra-escuela, siendo este un fuerte indicio de segmentación socioeconómica, es decir, de una alta homogeneidad socioeconómica de los alumnos que concurren a una misma escuela. En Argentina, este mismo comportamiento se había constatado con base en más de 235.000 alumnos de 6º de la educación primaria evaluados durante el Censo Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad (Cervini, 2009).","Los criterios metodológicos adoptados para lograr el objetivo propuesto son los siguientes: (i) la técnica de regresión multinivel con dos niveles (alumno, escuela) es la más apropiada; (ii) se consideran solamente el nivel socioeconómico familiar (alumno) y la composición socioeconómica y los recursos educativos de la escuela; (iii) el nivel socioeconómico no se considera un constructo y, por tanto, se utilizan simultáneamente tres indicadores directos, en vez del ESCS de PISA; (iv) finalmente, para aumentar la confiabilidad en la medición del tipo de escuela (titularidad) se usan dos indicadores: el tipo de gestión (privada/pública) y el porcentaje de recursos provenientes del sector público.",,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061148526

Linear regression and mean tests were used in the data analysis. The results indicated that 45.74% of the students are convergent style and 43.48% of the teachers are the assimilating learning style. Of the twenty-six groups analyzed, seven presented significant differences in academic performance, which are: reproof, dedicated weekly hours to extraclass studies, ENEM entrance note, ease in Mathematics and matching styles of teacher learning with the student. Students with the same teacher learning style tend to have a lower rate of reproof, proving the theory proposed by Kolb (1984). In this way, the theoretical platform addressed by Kolb (1984) helps to foment the debate and supports the strategies development for a cyclical education that meets the maximum of the existing learning needs, in particular, so that didactic teaching action can achieve all kinds of learning styles of students. © 2018 Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion.

The National Educational System grants a solution through the creation of multigrade schools to address this problem, where one school teacher teaches to two grades or more. Several studies report that children who attend these schools have an academic performance below the students of regular schools; however, these works do not evaluate quantitatively and large scale the knowledge of basic learning in education. This study evaluated some factors that influence the learning of the academic achievement according to the research of educational evaluation, of the students in multigrade schools, in Planea with 8104 students from 838 multigrade schools. The hierarquical linear modeling was employed for the analysis of the information. The outcomings exhibit differential effects of the factors; some of them affected the academic achievement; whereas, anothers, important according to others studies, they were not meaningful. The results show the influence of some factors recognized in the state; meanwhile another important variable was not significant. These results can be attributed to the limited information collected in that background questionnaires. © Universidad Autonoma de Madrid 2018.

Los factores Discapacidad Alumno y Media Escolar de Discapacidad Alumno influyen significativamente en el aprendizaje de Matemáticas, en los modelos donde se incluyeron. Los factores usados pueden considerarse variables proxy complejas de la vulnerabilidad en la que se encuentran los alumnos con alguna discapacidad que asisten a este tipo de servicio, los cuales afectan negativamente el aprendizaje en Matemáticas. No obstante, los recursos didácticos para trabajar con tales alumnos tuvieron efectos positivos, ¿bajo qué contexto es posible ubicar los resultados? El PIEE (2014), introducido para atenuar los efectos negativos en los alumnos en situación de vulnerabilidad, ha sido señalado como un programa que exhibió dificultades para establecer una definición y cuantificación precisas de las poblaciones a las que atendió (no hubo una conceptualización y caracterización uniforme de las poblaciones potencial y objetivo); de igual forma, careció de unificación en un informe de los diferentes beneficiarios del programa (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social, CONEVAL, 2015). Por ende, las políticas educativas orientadas a atender esta población aún no logrado tener el impacto esperado, aunque desde el punto de vista de la gestión escolar, al interior de las escuelas; ya se cuenten con los elementos necesarios para atenderla (de ahí que las discapacidades reportadas por el discente dicen poseer, por un lado; y, la disponibilidad de recursos para trabajar con ellos, según el director, por el otro; hayan sido estadísticamente significativos). Empero, estas aseveraciones distan mucho de poder generalizarse debido a que no abordan necesariamente, los temas relevantes a la inclusión de estudiantes con necesidades educativas especiales o en situación de vulnerabilidad. A la par, es necesario un análisis más puntual de cada uno de los indicadores que conformaron los distintos factores, el cual, por cuestiones de espacio y no corresponder a los objetivos del presente estudio, no fue realizado.","En México, la publicación ""PRONAEME-Proyecto Nacional de Evaluación y Mejora Educativa de Escuelas Multigrado"" (INEE, 2017a), muestra una extensa revisión de las políticas, programas federales, creación de institutos, y reformas al currículo que el SEN ha realizado para atender este tipo de servicio, entre el que se incluye el Programa para la Inclusión y la Equidad Educativa (PIEE), dentro del Marco Sectorial de la Educación 2012-2018, destinado a atender a estudiantes en situaciones de vulnerabilidad (niños indígenas, con discapacidad, e hijos de migrantes jornaleros); este grupo de estudiantes son los que integran en su gran mayoría la parte de la matrícula que recibe el servicio de educación multigrado (INEE, 2010, 2016b). En México, estas escuelas se caracterizan por materiales curriculares y pedagógicos insuficientes; mala infraestructura; currículo inflexible y graduado; escasa preparación profesional del docente. Todo esto, deriva que la enseñanza brindada en estas escuelas en comparación con la de escuelas graduadas es sumamente deficiente (Mulryan-Kyne, 2007), aun con los cambios curriculares realizados (INEE, 2016c).","De manera general, los estudios mencionados emplearon una metodología cualitativa o abordaron muestras pequeñas para llegar a las conclusiones presentadas (p. ej., Feltes y Reese, 2014; Mercado, 2012; Santos, 2011; Romero et al., 2010); esta es una limitación para generalizar hallazgos de los factores influyentes en el desempeño de los estudiantes en este tipo de servicio. Una alternativa a considerar es el empleo de las evaluaciones a gran escala; las cuales han sido útiles en la toma de decisiones en materia de política educativa en los últimos años tanto a nivel internacional (OECD, 2016); como nacional (INEE, 2015, 2017b). En México, la prueba Planea (Plan Nacional para la Evaluación de los Aprendizajes) del INEE, permite evaluar los aprendizajes clave de Lenguaje y Comunicación y Matemáticas, la cual al ser aplicada posee una representatividad nacional, estatal y por tipo de escuela (INEE, s/f). Considerando lo anterior, el objetivo del presente estudio fue conocer si existían factores individuales, familiares y escolares influyentes en el logro obtenido en Planea, debido a que se presenta como una prueba evalúa aprendizajes clave para tener éxito en la vida académica; y, consecuentemente, en la inserción social y laboral.","INEE.

METHOD: The research carried out was based on a qualitative logic based on the use of the Constant Comparative Method for the construction of analytical categories. The implementation of the field work involved a trip through mid-level schools in a number of Latin American countries with brief visits to 38 high school institutions in which semi-structured interviews were conducted specifically with directors and teachers in charge of projects related to the object of investigation. RESULTS: The analysis presented in the article focuses specifically on the different strategies for providing resources that are developed in educational institutions to seek to mitigate the impact of poverty on school activities.

En varios de los países de la región aparecen programas que se basan en la asignación de becas focalizadas en la población de mayor condición de vulnerabilidad. Con diversas modalidades, la provisión de becas se desarrolla en Chile, Perú, Bolivia y Uruguay. En el caso de Chile, las becas ocupan un lugar fundamental en la estrategia de abordaje a la vulnerabilidad particularmente, a través de varias becas que atienden a poblaciones específicas. El entramado complejo de becas que organiza la JUNAEB en Chile, con varios tipos de beca, de acuerdo a una focalización específica que se organiza desde el nivel central, supone una provisión o transferencia de recursos directa hacia sectores desfavorecidos. Este tipo de intervenciones pueden considerarse inversión social ya que su objetivo es lograr un impacto sobre las condiciones de vida de las familias receptoras (Martínez Nogueira, 2006). Resultan de particular interés las becas denominadas BARE. Estas becas tienen como objetivo estimular y apoyar a los y las estudiantes que presentan alto riesgo de abandonar el sistema escolar, para que logren finalizar con éxito su enseñanza media. En el listado de condiciones para la postulación a estas becas se establece: el acceso a través de una presentar factores de riesgo de deserción (sobreedad respecto al nivel cursado, baja asistencia el año inmediatamente anterior en los registros de Ministerio de Educación), condición de paternidad o maternidad, condición de embarazo o padres de hijos en gestación, estar registrado como infractor en algún programa de protección del SENAME (Servicio Nacional de Menores) dependiente del Ministerio de Justicia o presentar una discapacidad acreditada en el Registro Nacional de Discapacidad (JUNAEB, 2014).","Un caso radicalmente diferente de estrategias de provisión de recursos económicos es el de Uruguay con el Programa Compromiso Educativo. El objetivo del programa, desarrollado por el Consejo Directivo Central de la Administración Nacional de Educación Pública (ANEP), es contribuir a que adolescentes y jóvenes accedan, permanezcan y potencien sus trayectorias en el sistema educativo público y logren finalizar así completar la Educación Media Superior. Las becas de estudio conforman uno de los componentes de este programa, y constituyen un apoyo económico que busca contribuir al acceso y mantenimiento de los jóvenes en la educación media, en los casos en los que el aspecto económico un problema. No todos los jóvenes que participan del programa acceden a la beca. Quienes la desean la solicita y se evalúa su situación. La beca es de $8000 anuales (aprox. USD275) en 2017. El Programa Compromiso Educativo, no obstante, se trata de un caso de estrategia mixta dado que si bien incluye una entrega de dinero específico a un grupo de estudiantes con ciertos requisitos, también su puesta en marcha supone otros componentes que le dan una complejidad mayor. El Programa Compromiso Educativo además de la beca promueve la firma de un “Acuerdo Educativo”, que deben suscribir las autoridades de la institución, un adulto referente y el estudiante donde se especifican las metas y acciones concretas que las partes se comprometen a realizar para la mejora de la trayectoria escolar. Cada acuerdo responde a una situación particular y es único. Por otra parte, el programa incluye otro componente que es el “Espacios de Referencia entre Pares” que es un ámbito abiertos a todas/os las/os estudiantes del Centro Educativo del que participan estudiantes de nivel terciario y universitario, que acompañan a los estudiantes del liceo. La puesta en marcha de estos tres componentes supone la articulación de un entramado complejo de diversas instituciones públicas: el Consejo Directivo Central, y los Consejos de Formación en Educación, de Educación Secundaria y de Educación Técnico Profesional; el Instituto del Niño y el Adolescente del Uruguay además del Ministerio de Educación y Cultura y el Ministerio de Desarrollo Social. Partiendo de una realidad que se reconoce compleja, multidimensional y multicausal, Compromiso Educativo supone el trabajo de múltiples instituciones para, a partir de distintos instrumentos, acompañar las trayectorias escolares de los estudiantes, potenciándolas y promoviendo su continuidad. Según los datos disponibles, en 2014 el programa estuvo presente en 95 centros educativos de todo Uruguay y a lo largo de sus cuatro años de ejecución, se han firmado alrededor de 19.500 “Acuerdos Educativos”, se han entregado más de 18.000 becas de estudio, y han participado más de 1.700 estudiantes universitarios o de nivel terciario como tutores, generando un espacio de acompañamiento y seguimiento a los más de 25.000 estudiantes de escuela media superior que han participado (según datos disponibles en el programa hasta el 2015). Este tipo de intervenciones va más allá de la mera provisión de recursos y busca intervenir en la mejora de la experiencia escolar de los estudiantes que transitan por el programa.","Con la recuperación democrática, desde la década de los ochenta, los países latinoamericanos acuerdan metas y orientaciones para la acción regional en post de la concreción del Derecho a la Educación: el Proyecto Principal de Educación para América Latina y el Caribe (1980-2000); la Convención de los Derechos del Niño (adoptada por la Asamblea de las Naciones Unidas el 20 de noviembre de 1989); el Plan de Acción de la Cumbre Mundial por la Infancia (celebrada en Nueva York en septiembre de 1990) y las Cumbres de las Américas, entre muchos otros.",,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060872416

METHODS: A total of 924 students from the University of San Sebastian (Chile) participated in this cross-sectional cor¬relational study in spring 2016. Data were collected through 5 self-reported instruments, in addition to students' academic performance. The Cronbach alpha, descriptive statistics, and correla¬tion scores were computed. A k-means cluster analysis with intrinsic and controlled motivation was conducted to identify different mo-tivational profiles. Subsequently, multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for the effects of gender and year of study was carried out to assess differences among the retained motivational profiles and learning variables. RESULTS: All instruments showed acceptable Cronbach alpha scores. A 4-cluster solution was retained for the motivational profile over a 3- or 5-cluster solution. Students' motiva-tional profiles were characterized by different degrees of intrinsic and controlled motivation. The high intrinsic motivation groups showed higher perceptions of their basic psychological, a greater propensity for a deep rather than surface study strategy, better academic performance, and higher scores for self-esteem and vitality than the low intrinsic motivation groups, regardless of the degree of controlled motivation. CONCLUSION: Students with a high intrinsic motivation profile, regardless of their controlled motivation scores, reported better learning characteristics. Therefore, special attention should be paid to students' motivational profiles, as the quality of motivation might serve as a basis for interventions to support their academic success and well-being.","Chile; Dental students; Motivation; Personal satisfaction; Self concept","academic achievement; Chile; cross-sectional study; dental student; female; human; learning; male; motivation; psychology; questionnaire; self concept; young adult; Academic Performance; Chile; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Motivation; Self Concept; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060293603

Design/methodology: Content analysis of 248 MS from universities worldwide using Voyant Tools. Findings: The main results show: (1) a necessity for self-awareness by the universities; (2) an overall emphasis on society and students, as stakeholders; (3) there were no discernible similarities in keywords used between firms and universities; (4) MS tend to be longer in universities from Asia and shorter from Europe; (5) the absence of quantitative elementsinto MS (e.g. number of new students enrolled); (6) small universities prioritized knowledge over research; (7) the youngest universities tend to use more of the least frequently used words; (8) collaboration was a barely mentioned term, although the preeminence of research and the dominance of groups in knowledge is now a global trend; (9) the youngest universities tend to use more of the least frequently used words; (10) public universities emphasized individuals (i.e., students) and private universities emphasized education as a whole; and (11) the private sector has a noticeable interest in the society which contrasts with the public sector's focus on community. Research limitations/implications: Subsamples of certain regions should be more inclusive in further studies. Considering that the mean sample of MS studies was 89.6, this study used a sample more than two times larger. Although, both African (4) and Latin American (5) subsamples were not significant compared with European (94) or North American (79) subsamples. Further studies should consider a more-inclusive sampling than the QS world university ranking. Practical implications: University planning offices can use these results and the digital database to construct a global outlook on MS trends or uncommonly used words to define the purpose of their university and future course of action, embrace an overall isomorphism, or seek a distinctive strategy to differentiate their MS from others. In addition, this research can be used by strategic planning scholars to conduct regionally or nationally focused studies. Social implications: Universities' MS serve as public pronouncements of their purpose, ambition, and values. In this study, we present and analyze the contents of those purposes, in which mission-oriented universities, some of them global influencers, seek to perform in multiple levels of importance for every country (i.e., education, research, and services with both private and public sectors, and the community). Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been restricted to national contexts and based on reduced samples with no open access digital data. In this study, we consider a wide sample of universities from Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania.

Generalized matching happens when the subject’s response is controlled by these relations even when novel stimuli are presented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the moment when the identity and oddity relations are generalized, considering how many pairs of stimuli are needed for demonstrating generalization. Six male Wistar rats were trained on an oddity matching-to-sample procedure, and four were trained on an identity matching-to-sample. The olfactory stimuli were cups filled with scented sand in which the rats should dig to obtain a sugar pellet according to either the identity or oddity contingency. The experiment was divided into three phases, each having the training of one pair of stimuli and, after meeting the training criteria, a generalization test with novel stimuli. For this experiment, generalization is considered if the subject matched consistently according to the trained relation in at least 91,67% of the trials during the last testing session of each phase. The experiment ended when generalization was demonstrated in any of the three phases. The applied training showed to be more effective for oddity than for identity relations since the oddity group learned the trained relations faster and five of the rats were able to demonstrate generalization according to the defined testing criteria. Also, within the oddity group, there were rats that demonstrated generalization with less training than three pairs of stimuli, indicating that training with a large number of stimuli is not necessary to show generalized oddity relations. For the identity group, the number of training sessions was higher and only one rat met the testing criteria. Another problem addressed in this study is the effect of the contingency used during testing sessions over the subject’s performance. Tests under extinction decreased the choice response rate after a few trials. Tests under an undifferentiated reinforcement contingency solved this problem, however, they don’t eliminate the possibility of discrimination between training and testing sessions, what also could impair the evaluation of generalization. The results indicate the need for further investigations on better ways to evaluate generalization and on the difference in the acquisition of the oddity and identity relations. © 2018 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.All Rights Reserved.","Conditional discrimination; Generalization; Identity; Matching-to-sample; Oddity; Olfactory stimulus; Rats",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057995251

The phenomenon may involve operant as well as respondent aspects Different populations may present RSC, among them, children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). RSC can increase the challenge of learning to read and write. Previous research evaluated RSC using syllables stimuli, in choice matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. However, previous studies used a small number of participants and stimuli, which may have masked restricted control. Previous results also suggest that the pattern of responding may be an important aspect to consider. The purpose of the current study was to invesigate restricted stimulus control in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, using two-letter syllables. Patterns of error were analyzed to detect RSC. Six children (4-10 yrs) diagnosed with ASD participated in a matching- to -sample task. The experimental design was intrasubject, with two experimental phases: training in Identity Matching to Sample and Testing of RSC. Results showed prevalence of RSC with changes in the performance and error pattern throughout the sessions. RSC was especially related to the first letter of each stimulus (consonant). The results are relevant for planning alternative strategies to development of reading and skills.

Our general focus relies on number sense which research and knowledge have the following benefits: the possibility of early identi-fication of people who may have difficulties in learning mathematics; the identification of efficient teaching procedures to develop basic mathematical skills. Considering number sense studies our main interest is with research about baby’s subitization. We developed a critical introduction to cognitive research on subitization with human babies based on the criteria of originality and membership in one of the two research lines described by Cohen & Marks (2002). The studies select revealed that human babies are sensitive to numerical variations in their environment and that this ability is exclusively innate. Based on these studies, we presented some concepts in behavior analysis that could be used for a preliminary behavioral interpretation of the psychological processes underlying subitization, always pointing out possibilities of new studies and discussing the results of the revised research. We believe that Behavior Analysis has important interpretive contributions to offer based on its theoretical and methodological-experimental features not only help to plan experimental environments that prioritize control of the variables under study, but also help to ask relevant questions that can contribute to replicate the study with babies and interpreting its data. It is suggested that behavior analytical interpretation of perception, research about observation behavior and the stimulus equivalence paradigm can be used as initial possibilities to analyze data obtained in research on subitization.

A grounded theory approach was used to examine participants' behaviors and attitudes in college mathematics courses, their mathematics self-efficacy beliefs, and how these beliefs aligned with their mathematics competence. Interview participants reported relatively high mathematics self-efficacy, but many revealed a mismatch between their mathematics self-efficacy beliefs and mathematics competence levels. Participants who had a balance between these two factors reported being more likely to spend extra time working to overcome their mathematics deficiencies and seeking extra help. However, participants with a mismatch reported being more likely to procrastinate and put little effort into improving their mathematics competence, blaming external factors for their struggles.

They came with schoolchildren, which, according to the Federal Law ""On education in the Russian Federation"" have a right to general education together with the Russian citizens. But often in practice the educational achievements of these children are hindered by racism, intolerance, bad knowledge of the Russian language and other factors. Nonetheless, the results of empirical studies show that children of migrants demonstrate good academic progress, at least equal to the local students. The immigrant paradox hypothesis states that migrants are optimistic; they think and believe that in the recipient country they can fulfill their dreams and improve their living conditions. This optimism rubs off from parents to children, and as a result they study well in schools and their academic grades are high. But in the literature on academic progress there is no theory about influence of optimism on grades. In the psychological approach on academic progress recent empirical results especially stressed the role of assertiveness ""grit"", that is, persistence and passion for long-Term goals. Therefore, this article explores the influence of assertiveness on academic progress; mostly comparing assertiveness of migrant children and native children. Based on data gathered in the Yaroslavl region, and using descriptive statistics, tests of means and regression analysis the evidence suggests that children of migrants from the Caucasus have a higher level of assertiveness than the native children, which can explain their academic progress. © 2018 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

The sample used included observations over the period 2010-2015 taken from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (waves 19-24), which is a unique nationally representative survey. The method consisted of logit regressions with panel data, which allows for controlling time-invariant explanatory variables. The empirical analysis was divided into sport activities at school (in class) and outof- school (before or after classes). Furthermore, the regression analysis examined the effect of three large groups of sport activities: 1) Combat sports, such as karate, judo, self-defense, wrestling, and boxing, 2) Ball sports, such as tennis, soccer, basketball, and volleyball, 3) Athletic sports, such as track and field, skiing, and skating. General speaking, the findings indicated that sport activities at school do not have significant associations with educational achievements. On the other hand, sport activities out-of-school showed some positive relationships. Specifically, participation in athletic and combat sports increases the probabilities of boys and girls, respectively, being classified as high-performing students. Moreover, male students practicing ball sports outof- school are less likely to be classified as low-performing students. The time that students spent on these sports does not influence these probabilities. However, male students spending more than 10 hours per week on sports (high-performance sportsmen) are more likely than other students to be linked to the group of low-performing students. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.","Educational achievement; Logit regression; Panel data; Physical education; Russia; Sport activities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055693847

Socio-economic status, cultural capital (approached with number of books at home), health issues, type of settlement, class grade, number of siblings, and gender were controlled. The results also indicated that fluency in Chuvash and in Tatar, mother tongue proficiency, language used at home, and language of instruction in the elementary grades were not adversely related to educational achievements. On the one hand, these findings partially disagree with previous studies, where a positive association was found. It is probable, that the rural versus urban environment explain these differences. On the other hand, the results confirm previous research in the Volga area of Russia that growing concern among authorities on minority language students' educational achievements is baseless.

In this context, the Environmental Management course (GAM) was created at the Faculdade UnB de Planaltina (FUP) in 2008. In its first evaluation by the Ministry of Education (MEC), UnB GAM course achieved grade 4, not far from the maximum mark, which is 5. Research results, however, revealed a high dropout rate and low employability of degree holders, raising doubts about its quality as well as the effectiveness of MEC evaluation. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of the UnB GAM course by identifying its strengths and weaknesses through the perception of its former students. To do so, 43 questionnaires were reviewed through cluster analysis. The study revealed that the strengths were associated with the high quality of professors, workers and overall infrastructure of UnB. Weaknesses are found in difficulties inherent to the fact that the course is new and has not yet been recognized by an official professional board. Questions related to the curricular structure of the course, the quality of the laboratories and the library as well as incorporating students in projects of supervised undergraduate research, extension and internships in the respective training area were seen as showing intermediate-level quality. © 2018 Educ.

Nesse contexto, criou-se o curso de Gestão Ambiental (GAM) na Faculdade UnB de Planaltina (FUP), em 2008. Em sua primeira avaliação pelo Ministério da Educação (MEC), o curso de GAM da UnB alcançou nota 4, aproximando-se da nota máxima, que é 5. Resultados de pesquisa, porém, revelaram uma alta taxa de evasão e uma baixa empregabilidade do curso, levantando dúvidas sobre sua qualidade e a efetividade da avaliação do MEC. Assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a qualidade do curso de GAM da UnB, identificando seus pontos fortes e fracos por meio da percepção de seus egressos. Para tanto, analisaram-se 43 questionários respondidos por egressos do curso por meio da análise de cluster. O estudo revelou que os pontos fortes estiveram relacionados à alta qualidade dos professores, dos servidores e da infraestrutura geral da UnB. Os pontos fracos referem-se a dificuldades inerentes ao fato de o curso ser novo e ainda não reconhecido por um conselho de classe. Questões relacionadas à grade curricular do curso, à qualidade dos laboratórios e da biblioteca, bem como à inclusão dos alunos em projetos de iniciação cientifica, de extensão e em estágios na área de formação se encontraram com qualidade intermediária. © 2018 Educ.

Research data were collected from a mapping conducted in the universities, in the five geographical regions of Brazil, and they have shown a remarkable presence of discipline in teacher-training undergraduate courses. In addition to the mapping, we have also reviewed some educational policies, in other to think about how much they have impelled such debate around sexuality in teacher education. Based on the analyses undertaken, it was possible to realize that although the disciplines offered are more significant for teacher-training courses, just a few of them focus the school environment. Among the degree courses, Pedagogy emerged as the field of knowledge that prioritizes the discussions on sexuality, as we have found a significant number of disciplines delivered in that course. Concerning educational policies, they have propelled the debate around differences and diversity, which makes them a topic discussed in the discipline programs. These movements to analyze curricula in teacher-training course allowed us to problematize the displacements that the device of sexuality has been going through nowadays. © 2018 Educ.

The main objective of this article can be summarized to understanding the agencies the course is circumscribed within by identifying the aspects that make it closer to the rhizomatic curriculum as well as the molar lines of escape of this formative project. Therefore, an archaeological survey of the discourses was conducted based on semi-structured interviews focusing on performing the original project and on official documents, including the revisions of the original pedagogical project for BC & T and regulations affecting the course in the university. The concomitance of the interdisciplinary formative itineraries and specific professional training, the high number of class hours in curricular units chosen by the students and the absence of prerequisites altogether allowed the students to single out their education, avoiding the curricular unit desired in the traditional curricular grids. Such possibilities for a rhizomatic comprehension of the curriculum proposed by UFABC come into conflict with the traditional teacher education and into the options for a traditional management of the curriculum, which push the pedagogical project towards a traditional and positivist formation. © 2018 Educ.

In the sphere of Brazilian Association of Medical Education (ABEM), together with Rede UNIDA and the student segment, represented by National Executive Board of Medicine Students (DENEM), some initiatives were important to deal with the context mentioned above. Among them, the creation, in 2004, during the Brazilian Medical Education Congress, of a group to provide subsidies to the understanding of the theme by means of research. At the same time, teachers were looking for qualification opportunities abroad, while others invested their time and efforts in the development of local projects, like the UNI Projects (A New Initiative in the Education of Professionals: Union with the Community), to prepare the ground for the desired changes. Broader education processes like the “Activators of Processes of Change in the Higher Education of Health Professionals” and the “Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research” (FAIMER) proposed large-scale education in the specialization level for teachers with the aim of facilitating the implementation of changes. At the same time, some leaderships sought the support of agencies like Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), which, with the decisive participation of Management Department for Health Work and Education (SGTES) of the Ministry of Health, published, in 2010, Notice number 24, instituting Pró-Ensino na Saúde5.

In this context, it is still unknown how gender differences relate to socioeconomic status (SES), and whether girls from less privileged backgrounds or from less privileged schools have even less opportunities to succeed in mathematics. Utilizing data from Chile (a country in the region that has consistently reported male advantage in mathematics) and a multilevel modelling framework for its analysis, this article describes how gender differences are distributed in the population, exploring how they may change at different levels of the SES distribution. Results suggest that boys consistently outperform girls in both early and late primary school, and that girls progress less between these years. In addition, a significant interaction with SES shows that this gap is larger for students with lower SES, with school SES effects being highly dependent on family SES effects.

Therefore, verifying the variables that effectively influence food choices and consumption certainly has social validity and undeniable relevance. The present study investigated the effects of healthy food videos on the dietary choices of 24 students from a public school, both sexes, aged 10 to 11 years. Those responsible signed written informed consent form authorizing the participation of children in the experiment. The children selected were those that the responsible duly completed the food consumption questionnaire and the general questionnaire. The food frequency questionnaire discriminated between healthy and unhealthy food choices. The general questionnaire evaluates the socioeconomic profile of the participants. The children selected were the ones that had the highest indexes of unhealthy food choices, as reported in the food frequency questionnaire. The experimental design involved three phases divided into two conditions: exposures to short and long videos. Phase 1 consisted of the application of the food appointment test, with correction procedure, whose objective was to verify and / or teach the correct naming of the foods that would be used. Each food was presented between healthy and unhealthy, including fruit, sweet, snacks, drinks and plate with food. In Phase 2, were applied, food choices test, videos display, comprehension tests of the story and reapplication of the food choices test. In the food choice test choices were required from actual food photos, displayed in a table with six available foods, three healthy and three unhealthy foods. Educational videos were categorized into two conditions, short videos that were less than 2 minutes long and long videos lasting over 2 to 9 minutes. After exposure to each condition, participants underwent tests that assessed the understanding of the story about the importance of eating healthy foods. In Phase 3, the maintenance of the choices was verified after a week, reapplying the test of food choices. The results point to an increase in the number of healthy food choices for most children. However, after one week, reapplication of the tests showed the temporary effect of the videos, since the percentages of the children's choices were similar to those seen at the first test performed. It is concluded that exposure to educational videos on healthy eating may influence the choices of healthy foods for children, but this effect does not seem to be lasting. Thus, it can be stated that the effect of the videos influenced the choices of healthy foods and, therefore, may also influence the consumption of this type of food.

As the explosion of information in sciences and integration theories led to creating different curriculum designs, it has been assumed that differences among designs explain academic success and, therefore, students’ retention. However, little attention has been given to examine explicitly how diverse designs influence dropout rates in practice, which questions if decisions to reform curricula are sufficiently informed. This article describes our curriculum reform, which exposes our former and current curriculum designs as having had dissimilar dropout percentages. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the influence of different curriculum designs on students’ dropout rates. The conclusion is that dropout variations may be explained not only because of the curriculum design itself, but also because of the power relationship changes between teachers and students that brought out the design change. Consequently, more research is needed to fully understand the political implications of different curriculum designs and their influence on dropout rates. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Students were classified based on their experience level, level of interaction with teachers and classmates, and the use they do with technology for academic activities. The results showed that the level of experience does not affect academic success, but does have an incidence on plagiarism levels that increase as this experience increases. Plagiarism reaches higher levels when level of experience, family income and hours of connection per day increases.

En ese sentido, los docentes que han realizado el mayor número de obras científicas son aquellos que han laborado en un promedio de seis a diez años en las IES pero con una dedicación total a tiempo completo y con un número importante de horas asignadas para la investigación; es decir, existe un cambio que bordea el 52.8% de incremento de la producción científica en base a las horas asignadas. En este punto, es oportuno destacar el compromiso de los docentes con mayor experiencia al llevar a la reflexión sobre su práctica educativa y los procesos de investigación encaminados a la búsqueda de condiciones transformadoras del rol educativo. Se cree que ello obedece a que el docente con trayectoria académica dilatada que se encuentra inmerso en actividades de investigación tiende a asumir de forma crítica el contenido de sus asignaturas y a trabajar de forma interdisciplinaria, para que su experiencia sea compartida en revistas indexadas y de alto impacto. Los docentes con mayor experiencia han afrontado el reto de la universidad del siglo XXI para el Ecuador, lo que les ha permitido dominar ciertos aspectos tradicionales de la docencia, integrándolos exitosamente con la investigación y por ende acrecentando su producción científica. Para estos docentes, el hábito de la publicación constante contribuye a su desarrollo profesional y personal e influye positivamente en su labor académica.","Es de resaltar que después de realizar el análisis multivariado de varianza con la variable sexo, se evidenció que tanto hombres como mujeres mantienen una producción científica homogénea. Este resultado desmitifica a la mujer como figura de segundo plano en el orden de la publicación científica, a pesar de ciertas dificultades que afrontan las mujeres para consolidarse dentro del ámbito educativo; pues las mujeres se ven obligadas a duplicar el esfuerzo para lograr un trato igualitario (Ibarra y Llanos, 2016); al parecer algunos de los inconvenientes se relacionan con la cultura organizacional de las IES frente a la construcción de la igualdad de género en el ámbito cultural y académico. En esta investigación ha quedado claro que si bien en el Reglamento de Carrera y Escalafón del Profesor e Investigador del Sistema de Educación Superior del Ecuador, aprobado por el Consejo de Educación Superior (CES), se establece el tipo de personal académico de las IES y el tiempo de dedicación para las labores de docencia, investigación, vinculación y gestión académica, principalmente han condicionado la producción científica dos factores: la antigüedad en la docencia universitaria, y, fundamentalmente, la cantidad de horas asignadas a las actividades de investigación.","Una de las limitaciones del presente estudio es la definición del número de horas específicas de cada investigador, que se basa en los resultados obtenidos de la producción obtenida en los años 2014, 2015, 2016 y 2017 de los docentes con mayor y menor número de publicaciones. Por otro lado, probablemente el total de la muestra es reducido, al tratarse del personal con horas de investigación y a quienes se aplicó el instrumento diseñado; los docentes que carecían de carga horaria de investigación durante los 2 años en que se realizó el estudio no fueron incluidos en el presente estudio. Por lo tanto, recomendamos que los resultados de este trabajo se valoren a la luz de estas posibles faltas, de ser considerados como insumo para la toma de decisiones y la generación de políticas intra-universitarias respecto a la asignación de horas para la investigación y la capacitación docente. Otro aspecto que puede haber constituido un sesgo es que la categoría producción de capítulos de libros, específicamente en el año 2014 puede haber incluido algún registro que no se ajuste al requisito actual de revisión por pares académicos, lo cual puede haber dado lugar a una sobrestimación de los resultados entre los docentes con mayor número de publicaciones. Sin embargo, se decidió incluir los datos correspondientes al 2014, por ser el año en que inició el despegue de la producción científica en la facultad.","Los autores agradecen el apoyo de la Universidad Nacional de Chimborazo y en particular del Vicerrectorado de Posgrado e Investigación y de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Humanas y Tecnologías.",,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052695942

The Dental School of the University of Medical Sciences of Havana has been accredited in two opportunities with the condition of major of excellence. However, the number of philosophy doctors is insufficient in relation to quality standards. Objective: to describe the current situation of doctoral training in the Dental School of Havana. Method: adiagnostic study was carried out using theoretical and empirical methods. Administrative documents on the subject and evaluation reports for the major accreditation were reviewed. Brainstorming was carried out with the board of directors and some invited philosophy doctors. An innovated SWOT matrix was created for the situational analysis of doctoral training at the School. Results: 7.5 % of the faculty are philosophy doctors, with an average age of 69.4 years. Since 2012, this has shown a progressive decrease. The weaknesses most affecting the training of philosophy doctors are the lack of a strategy of early recruitment for aspirants (11.7 %), inadequacies of the current strategy (11.2 %), followed by inadequate stimulation for physicians (11, 2 %) and the quality of the processes and control of the activity (10.7 %).

The analysis considered the extension, textual diversity, and the origin and number of compiled texts, as well as the lexical density and the use of adverbialized adjectives and adverbs ending in - mente, in order to determine the representativeness of the written register in these materials. The results indicate a predominance of fictional texts that progressively have presented less lexical density and extension; in addition, there has been an increase in the inclusion of texts from folk traditions. We report that the lexical density of the compiled literary texts adheres to prototypical parameters of this textual type, and that the nonfictional texts show less density.

We begin by discussing how the meaning of a physical concept is constructed, through its relations with others. In physical theories, these connections usually involve mathematical operations. We focus on the concept of mass and its changes in three different contexts, namely classical mechanics, electromagnetism and relativity. Modifications are displayed as shifts in its relative position in conceptual schemes. These schemes enforce visual knowledge and may be used as didactical tools for teaching the subject, since they stress both the signification of mass in classical mechanics and its re-signification in relativity. This paves the way for a discussion of different approaches adopted for teaching the mass-energy relation in relativity, expressed by the famous formula E = mc2. As the terms rest mass, relativistic mass and invariant mass, which have different ontological and epistemological contents, are part of this discussion, we consider the main approaches to mass present in both relativity textbooks and discourses by some influential physicists. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

They can model many types of problems related to heat diffusion and membrane vibration, for example. When the analytical solution of these problems is needed one may find extra difficulties when the boundary conditions that describe the phenomena are nonhomogeneous. In this way, in this work is presented a technique for solving initial and boundary problems by means of integral transformations. The differential of the presentation is in the construction of the integral transform appropriate to the solution of the problem. These transformations are known as finite transforms and in this case they are related to a Sturm-Liouville problem associated with the differential operator connected to the differential equation. As an example, we solve two problems of heat diffusion in different spatial coordinates systems. The presentation of the work follows in pedagogically and self-contained fashion.

In Brazil, several astronomical topics are teached in basic education, both at the fundamental and medium levels. In addition, the number of researches and activities about scientific dissemination and teaching in non-formal places is increasing. Educational activities and scientific dissemination in this context, if well done, can contribute to the socialization and popularization of astronomy knowledge. Besides that, they can help to improve the knowledge of teachers and students. In this way, the debate on the subject is important and should be instigated both in the non-academic context and in the scope of teacher and student training. In this way, a practical project of the Physics Department (CODAFIS) of the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais - Campus Ouro Preto (IFMG-OP) was started in 2011, offering observations and activities on Astronomy for the local population and neighboring cities. Since then, more than 7,000 people have attended the actions, which shows the large potential of the theme. Astronomy discussions naturally lead to Physics, when concepts and many other subjects can be treated in an applied way. In general, people are more interested in activities in this context than in traditional teaching environments. However, poorly designed or poorly developed activities can generate adverse reactions in the public, leading to dislike on the subject. Thus, this article's main objective is to identify elements that can culminate with the non-effectiveness of the observation activities. In addition, it seeks to identify parameters that are determinant for the success of the actions, in addition to sharing empirical knowledge obtained with the development of the project and to encourage groups, academic or otherwise, to develop similar astronomical activities in formal and non-formal educational environments and also in different regions of the country. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

If learning by exclusion were a robust phenomenon, evidence of learning should be observed when different types of probes are used; however, rarely have discrimination probes been used with this purpose. This study had the objective of verifying for seven children, aged between 18 and 22 months, the establishment of relations between words and objects in discrimination probes - which evaluated the sample-S+ relation - after the emergence of a conditional relation in responding by exclusion, as well as exploring the possibility of creating the conditions for stability of these relations after re-exposure to trials similar to the exclusion and discrimination probes. Participants selected objects conditionally to spoken words in auditory-visual matching-to-sample tasks. The procedure included establishing a baseline, probes (control, exclusion, discrimination), teaching the name-object emergent relation, and a follow-up. In baseline, correct responses produced compliments and access to the object as consequences. Incorrect responses were followed by a removal of the stimuli, an inter-trial interval, and silence from the experimenter. There were no programmed consequences for responses in probe trials. Control probes verified whether responding was under control of the novelty property of the stimuli. Emergence of conditional relations was verified in exclusion probes and establishment of emergent relations was tested through discrimination probes. Teaching emergent name-object relations was programmed for participants who did not reach the criterion of establishment of emergent relations (correct in all discrimination probes). The teaching phase verified the necessary number of re-exposures to trials similar to exclusion trials, in CRF, to obtain the expected performance in discrimination probes. Follow-up of the establishment of emergent relations was verified between two and six days after the last discrimination probe. Six out of seven children responded by exclusion. One participant responded to the stimuli from the discrimination probes after one exclusion trial and nine subsequent trials, similar to exclusion trials, and in the follow up. Two participants conducted all stages of the experiment with no signs of established emergent relations in the follow-up. Another participant went through emergent name-object teaching and was not successful in responding to the discrimination probes; and two other participants did not did not go through emergent name-object teaching. These results suggest that discrimination probes can be used to verify the acquisition of new name-object relations (measure of learning). These results also suggest that exposure to reinforced exclusion trials can increase the probability of correct responding in later discrimination probes, indicating stability of the name-object emergent relation. Considering the peculiarities of the participants, alternative methods are needed to investigate the maintenance of the emergent relation by exclusion, and suggests the systematic replication of the procedure used in this study with a larger number of participants of the same age range. © 2018 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

This exam is a relevant source of data for the evaluation of what is learned by high school students. In this paper, twelve selected questions are presented, from the Natural Sciences exam in the period between 2009 and 2014, questions that were classified as ""physics questions"", in which the alternatives reveal well-delimited non-scientific conceptions described in the literature. From the students' performance on these items, observations about the learning process in physics in basic education are made. This study reveals that there are some permanent difficulties in understanding basic concepts of mechanics, thermal phenomena and geometric optics. Many of these questions point to the presence and even predominant role of non-scientific conceptions described in the research literature in physics teaching. Even knowing how difficult it is to modify these conceptions, the results reveal that, despite all the research effort in physics teaching since the 1980s, there was little impact of the results in the learning process, and only a few changes incorporating this knowlege in the didactic materials and in the teacher training courses. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

Capitalizing on an opportunity for comparative critical reflection on the relevant political, economic and social histories that have underpinned the development of nursing education in China, Brazil and Canada-three countries united by shared values about equity and access to health services-we sought to deconstruct the manner in which these forces have shaped the national differences in the way we conceptualize and deliver nursing education. On this basis, we examined the implications for the advancement of nursing education within each national context, recognizing the fundamental relevance of indepth critical reflection for optimizing nursing's advocacy capacity within each of our national health care and policy systems. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","advocacy; health policy; national culture; social context","article; Brazil; Canada; China; health care policy; human; human experiment; nursing education; public health service; social environment; clinical competence; cultural competence; curriculum; education; nursing education; nursing student; organization and management; public health; standards; statistics and numerical data; Brazil; Canada; China; Clinical Competence; Cultural Competency; Curriculum; Education, Nursing; Health Policy; Humans; National Health Programs; Students, Nursing","Rockefeller Foundation","The first formal schools of nursing in Brazil date back to the early 1920s. Initially, the main objective of nursing education was to prepare nurses to care for persons who faced social problems such as urbanization, the care of soldiers who had faced war, and the poor living conditions associated with rapid migration of rural populations into city centres, immigration into the country, and the resultant spread of communicable diseases (Oguisso & Freitas, 2015). During this developmental period, nursing education was supported by an American nurse, Ethel Parsons, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1922, with a group of about 20 nurses funded by the Rockefeller Foundation to assist with a yellow fever epidemic (Oguisso & Freitas, 2015). In the course of her work, she met Edith de Magalhães Fraenkel, inviting her to study at the Philadelphia General Hospital School of Nursing. Completing that program in 1925, Miss Fraenkel became Brazil’s first graduate nurse (Oguisso, 2007). Parsons and her group, by now calling themselves the Parsons Mission, set up a school for nurses to assist the country to deal with both the current and future epidemics. In 1926, this first official school was renamed the Ana Nery School for Nurses in honour of a Brazilian historical figure who had cared for wounded soldiers in the 1864–1870 war with Paraguay (Oguisso & Freitas, 2015). Both Parsons and Fraenkel were instrumental in bringing the Nightingale model of nursing education into the Brazilian context, and ultimately establishing a number of nursing schools within hospitals (Oguisso, 2007; Oguisso & Freitas, 2015; Severo & Siqueira, 2013).",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048316278

In order to get the data were surveyed 208 students enrolled when the test was applied. The questionnaire used was the scale of Mato and Muñoz-Vázquez (2007). The statistical procedure was exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) with extraction method: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization (KMO, Bartlett test of Sphericity, MSA, X2 with df, α = &lt; 0.05). The result suggests that the factor ANXTMSDL (0.933) is the largest factor load, which suggests that the profile of the medical student, generates greater anxiety when faced with operations in daily life and the factor (ANXTT 0.626) is the factor that has a lower factor load, which leads us to think that anxiety towards the temporality of assessments or exams is not present, perhaps because, in the curriculum of the majoring the topics of mathematics are not integrated. © 2018 by Academic Publishing.","Anxiety toward math; Undergraduate medical student",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048158755

In this sense, the objective of this work is to carry out an evaluation through the use of the Carbon Footprint indicator, in the University Campus of Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV). Its application aims to study an environmental system to determine how the provision of a service can occur without being subsidized by an ecological deficit. The methodology makes it possible to evaluate the university campus as an open system analyzing the components that emit carbon through the consumption of water, electric power, mobility, paper, construction and generation of waste, as well as quantification of vegetation for carbon fixation and capture. When applying the methodology the total values of carbon emission and fixation on average by the number of students were obtained. As a result of the research, for 2011-2012 (most current data available) the UCV campus needed an extension of 2,012.85 hectares (ha) of forest to assimilate carbon emissions, obtaining a Carbon Footprint of 0.030 ha /Student /year. © Universidad de Caldas.","Carbon footprint; Co2 emissions; Environment; Indicators",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047646916

To proceed with the conceptualization, we researched for articles and books, followed by a screening and subsequent analysis and exploration of the concepts in the bibliographic study's perspective. Regarding the discussion of meanings, we chose a research as object of study to carry out the analysis, in the meta-analysis perspective, of aspects that illustrate how these concepts are associated with this relationship. The theoretical framework refers to authors who discuss affordance theory and theorizing about structuring, specifically agency. Data analysis shows that teachers knowledge, beliefs, and values influence information acquisition from curriculum materials, leading them to infer affordances, situate the agency in them and in the materials, and provoke the shift of power between the two agents. It also shows that affordances and agency can be collective skills provided by the exchange between teachers and their peers. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The methodology applied was mixed and a Likert questionnaire-alpha 0.807-was applied as data collection instrument to 149 students and a semi-structured interview to 28 students. The findings show a high degree of student rejection towards the subject of Calculus, and the predominant manifestation of negative feelings to: the teaching methodology, the written exam as the predominant form of assessment, the learning activities, the teacher's attitude in the classroom, among other aspects inherent to the educational process.

Environmental factors such as socioeconomic level (SEL) influence reading and maths skills as well as EFs. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which executive functions play a mediating role between SEL and reading and maths performance. To this end, we assessed 286 Chilean primary education students: 86 with a high SEL and 200 with a low level. The results show that the high-SEL group obtained consistently higher scores than their peers with low SEL levels in both reading and maths tasks as well as in EF measurements. This suggests that SEL could influence the development of these variables. The results also showed that EFs partially mediate the relation between SEL and reading and maths skills in primary school students through the specific function of inhibition. The results are discussed in light of the effect of SEL on the development of EFs and school learning. © 2018 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Cognitive development; Executive functions; Mathematics; Reading; Socioeconomic level",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1141083","This study has been financed through the Fondecyt 1141083 project: Efectos de la",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046852636

In order to analyze the results from a mathematical-statistical perspective, descriptive statistics were used, in particular the calculation of the mean and the percentage analysis. The results showed that, of the 26 students, 50% rated themselves to have a fair level of essay writing ability. These self-assessment results do not correspond to the quality of the essays written by the students, who demonstrated a low level of essay writing ability.

In recent years, the educational system has been able to perceive that, in scientific areas such as geometry, students have been limited to the role of receivers of conceptual contents from texts and websites, leaving aside the interaction by the learner with the surrounding environment. Studies using surveys conducted based on a Likert scale and administered with questions in simple language that is easily understood by the respondents have shown us that if the utility of environmental resources can be successfully merged with scientific areas, the result is greater knowledge acquisition and interest among students, especially in the area of geometry.

The variables of performance were reaction time, movement time, and response time and the kinematic variables were peak of speed, relative time to peak of speed, and number of peak acceleration points. The main findings showed that GPA showed lower movement time and response time than GPB.

Increasing the number of diverse and non-traditional students in higher education (HE) institutions presents challenges in learning and teaching in online, conventional and hybrid contexts, impacting on student academic success. The purpose of this paper is to expand our understanding of student perceptions of the factors involved in academic achievement. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative methods and in-depth semi-structured interviews, 14 participants were interviewed. Using Freire’s concept of empowerment, and Bordieu’s concept of habitus, the authors explore student perceptions of assessment. Findings: Results presented thematically indicate that student perceptions of the purpose of the assessment and academic qualification are at odds with institutional habitus. Several embargoes impacting on academic achievement were revealed. Research limitations/implications: Shifting organisational patterns and modes of production within HE institutions have influenced the student experience of academic writing and assessment. Findings highlight the factors that impact on academic success in HE institutions for non-traditional students in particular. Social class and educational background (habitus) are not factors taken into account when students are assessed. This impacts on capacity to achieve academic success. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for curriculum designers, and self-reflective practitioners on issues related to academic success for non-traditional students. Social implications: The study uses two case studies from two countries, Scotland and Brazil, both countries have invested heavily to address the twenty-first century learning agenda.

Considering our perspective as researchers and professors at División de Educación Básica, the paper addresses a current topic within the socio-educative field to face challenges of contemporary educational models in formal and non-formal areas of elementary education in the Costa Rican context. Our purpose is that students and teachers of the career program Pedagogía con énfasis en I y II ciclos de la Educación General Básica have an overview of the national, social, and educational reality in an attempt to involve them in applying pedagogical actions towards finding a solution to school dropouts at Escuela Finca Guararí, Heredia, Costa Rica. The essay describes the experience of teaching education students and their socio-educational action with the focus on the systematization of the experience in the initial stage of the project. Furthermore, the paper connects with emerging strategic knowledge areas at División de Educación Básica (DEB), such as social and community pedagogy in the context of the National University (UNA) of Costa Rica. It takes over a route already traced at DEB, which proposes more flexible and alternative pedagogic formats to promote educational equity and diversity issues. The paper describes the project background and a theoretical framework, as well as aspects that have been shared by the protagonist actors along the process: students-Teachers, host teachers, supervisor professors, school children, and their parents at Escuela Finca Guararí. Conclusions address main results and facts during 2016 in order to show the viability of the project, which is conducted from a public university. Finally, the article also includes an overview of the project's future in terms of its implementation in the Costa Rican context. © 2018 Universidad Nacional.

A quantitative, descriptive correlation and cross-sectional type research was carried out to achieve this aim. 70 students from the 4th, 5th and 6th grades (ages 8-12), three teachers and 12 parents from a public school in the province of Almeria, Spain, participated in the study. Three questionnaires were designed (for students, teachers and parents) to collect the information; they were based on theoretical models (Bisquerra & Pérez, 2007) and standardized self-report inventories in emotional competencies (Extremera & Fernández-Berrocal, 2004; Matson et al., 1983). The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a comparison between groups, and a correlation between variables. Among the main results, students reported that they did greater work in strengthening their emotional awareness, followed by emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships. There were no significant differences in emotional management and responsible decision making among students from the three academic years; however, males reported greater emotional control than females. A significant correlation between emotional competencies and responsible decision making in pre-Adolescents was found. Teaching staff mentioned having done greater work in the development of students' emotional awareness and support of their responsible decision making. Parents, in turn, seek to help their sons and daughters to be more self-reliant, in addition to working collaboratively with the school, by documenting or seeking support to contribute to education and personal development of their children. © 2018 Universidad Nacional.

The results provide significant evidence to ascertain that there is a component which explains the attitude towards Statistic of high-school students and it has three dimensions: liking, confidence and usefulness. The former leads us to think that there is a factor with an affective, a behavioral and a cognitive part. Hence, the affective component is present when they like working with Statistics; confidence is a behavioral component associated with the disposition and security a subject has when facing Statistic and finally, usefulness as a cognitive component involving beliefs, that is to say, the value a student places on the knowledge of Statistic. © 2018 by Academic Publishing.","Attitude towards Statistic; High-school students; Student's attitudes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044031649

This was based on the seminal works of Richardson and Suinn [1972], who developed the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) instrument with 98 items. This was later modified by Alexander and Martray [1989] to develop the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (RMARS) with only 25 items. For this study, the test was applied to a sample of 200 high school students of first, third and fifth semesters. The reliability of the test was a: 0.934 per item and 0.693 per dimension, which suggests acceptable validity and consistency in terms of what Hair, et al. point out [1979]. For the test of the H1 and H2 hypotheses, Exploratory Factor Analysis with extraction of the Principal Components and the Chi2c> Chi2t> statistic suggest that, as a whole, the dimensions of the RMARS scale explain mathematical anxiety. In addition, they indicate that anxiety towards mathematics classes is greater than anxiety towards exams and mathematical tasks; all this accounts for 74 % of the assimilable variance. For H3, the ANOVA test is used to show if there is a difference in means. The results suggest that there are no differences by Gender, Age. Or School Grade, although the MATHTEST dimension in Gender, showed differences in variances. © 2018 by Academic Publishing.","Attitudes; Beliefs; Emotions; MARS and RMARS scales; Mathematical anxiety; Mathematical courses; Mathematical exams; Numerical tasks",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044024120

Andalusia was chosen because this is one of the autonomous communities with the largest number of music conservatories at the elementary level. A descriptive methodology was used, through content analysis. Data was collected with an instrument composed of 41 items. A comparison of the different methods of initiation to cello was carried out, according to four analytic dimensions: didactic-methodological aspects, physical parameters, psychological aspects and musical sensitization. The results for the first dimension show a divergence between the analyzed texts regarding the role of the teacher in the didactic process. Regarding physical parameters, there is a lack of content in the different methods that does not help to prevent possible health problems and performance in young students. Additionally, little attention is given to the development of psychological aspects (concentration and memory). Finally, the methods analyzed show special attention to aspects related to the musical sensitization dimension (tuning, rhythmic sense and study habits). The results of this study highlight the importance of teacher training in active, creative and contemporary teaching methodologies, since most of the methods analyzed leave teachers with highly relevant aspects in the musical development of students. © Psychology, Society, & Education, 2018.","Analysis of teaching methods; Cello; Teachers; Teaching-learning music",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043769299

With these two variables we constructed aggregated indicators at both a national and state level. We also used logistic regression models as dependent variables. The variations between federal entities are not entirely explained by their socioeconomic levels; also, the opportunities for making the transition to highschool education continue to be linked to a combination of disadvantages based on where children live, underlying social inequalities and sociodemographic aspects that pose an enormous challenge to attaining universal coverage by the beginning of the next decade. © Perfiles Educativos, 2018.","Absorption in education; Completion rate; Education inequality; Education opportunities; Education transition; High school education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043356358

The identification of factors that influence the result of this examination can contribute to providing support necessary to improve the quality of medical courses. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the factors that affect the National Student Performance Examination grades of Brazilian undergraduate medical programs. Methods: Factors that influenced the 2010 ENADE grades of 100 undergraduate medical programs were studied. Data collection was performed using public databases. Academic and healthcare infrastructure variables were investigated. The data analysis was based on the performance of the medical programs on the 2010 ENADE, whereby the programs were divided into two groups: ENADE 1-2 (unsatisfactory grade) versus ENADE 4-5 (satisfactory grade). Results: One hundred schools were included in this analysis. In the univariate analysis the university variables (p=0.037), public institution (p<0.001), lower number of openings per course (p=0.036), lower number of specialist professors (p=0.003) and higher number of doctors (p=0.010), strictu sensu post-graduation program (p<0.001), higher course lifetime (p<0.001) were associated to best results in ENADE. In the multivariate analysis of logistic binary regression four variables remained independently associated to a better performance in ENADE: public institution (OR 9.9; 95%CI 1.03 to 95.5), lower number of openings per course (OR 0.984; 95% CI 0.969 to 0.999), strictu sensu post-graduation program (OR 8.189; 95% CI 1.459 to 45.971) and longer course lifetime (OR 1.058; 95% CI 1.013 to 1.105). Conclusions: The satisfactory score of this evaluation (ENADE 4-5) was associated to the public administration category of higher degree institutions, lower number of openings offered per course, the presence of a strictu sensu and longer course lifetime. © 2018 Neto et al.","Independent medical assessment; Medical education; Medical school","Brazil; educational status; human; medical education; student; Brazil; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Status; Humans; Students","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Ministry of Higher Education; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Ministério da Educação (Ministry of Education).

The Brazilian Open University System (UAB) is a branch of a public educational policy designed to address that problem. This quantitative/descriptive paper analyses UAB System statistics (2006 to June 2015), specifically regarding vacancies, enrolment and the number of students that graduate. It was revealed that 68.3% of all vacancies were allocated to teacher education courses, and within that sphere 67.5% were degree courses for basic education teachers and 32.4%, complementary courses. The enrolment percentage was around 86%, while the proportion of students graduating was around 61%. Analysis of the figures suggests that the UAB sought to achieve its main goal, as a public policy that induces teacher education for Brazilian basic education teaching staff. However, it is conjectured that problems related to the teaching profession itself discourage students from joining and from finalizing their courses, thereby weakening the potential performance of the UAB System. © 2018 Ensaio.","Brazilian Open University System (UAB); Education policy; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042085838

This article shares this perspective and looks into forms of training primary school teachers through practice in Paraná in the second half of the 19th century, based on the understanding that this type of training marked a period in which public education was becoming consolidated in the midst of actions, deliberations, difficulties and tensions in the attempt to improve public education conditions. This study made use of education legislation of the period as well as documents produced by subjects involved in public education at that time and available at the Paraná Public Archives. Through the collation and analysis of the sources, it can be stated that the training of primary school teachers through practice in the province of Paraná took place during the development of the process which lead to the constitution of formal primary teacher training.","19th Century; Province of Paraná; Teacher training; Teaching profession",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041544441

In 1900, the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, today the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil, began mission in the German colonies in the state, founding religious congregations and parochial schools. These schools were part of a missionary and community project that sought to teach the mother tongue, mathematics, as well as cultural, social and mainly religious values. In its whole of 164 pages, journal Unsere Schule brings contributions to the Lutheran parochial schools in Rio Grande do Sul, through biblical texts, information and pedagogical articles in different areas of knowledge. Journal Unsere Schule presents didactic orientations for the teaching of mathematics using the intuitive method, gives publicity to arithmetic books and publishes pedagogical articles for the practical teaching of geometry and units of measure.","Gaucho lutheran parochial schools; History of education; Mathematics; Pedagogical periodical",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041540038

In terms of theoretical-methodological approach, some of the salient concepts are appropriation, circulation (of ideas/objects/subjects), and authorized discourse, based on the works of authors such as Roger Chartier (1990, 2002, 2009), Serge Gruzinski (2001a, 2001b), and Michel de Certeau (2012). In addition to his travel report, this study also draws on other books and articles published by Alves, the curricula of the Institutes of Education of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, teaching manuals, and newspapers available in the Digital Newspaper Collection of the National Library. Among other findings, it is observed that Isaias Alves's travel report lent visibility to the discussions and publications of the American psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike that focused on mathematics education. It is also observed that the dialogue established between educational psychology and mathematics education was strongly linked to discussions about tests and that the manner in which Isaias Alves read and portrayed mathematics education was from the perspective of psychology.","Circulation; Educational psychology; Edward Lee Thorndike; Isaias Alves; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041537645

Based on a supposed binariness which is historically believed to exist and defines only the opposed poles, i.e., knowing everything and knowing nothing of mathematics, the conditions are created for triggering a mechanism in which, first, there is the perpetuation of the current view that this subject is only meant for special, illuminated beings and, later, there is an inversion of categories between what is 'in' and what is 'out' regarding the set of those who know mathematics and the set of those who do not know mathematics. In respect to this binariness, we point its impossibility in today's society, due to the fact that there are no longer individuals who know all the existing mathematics - the last one of them, according with some historians, would have been Poincaré, in the early 20th century - nor individuals without any mathematical knowledge, even if only a non-formal knowledge. Because of the nature of the phenomena studied and the specificities of our approach, we chose a qualitative methodology.

Among the different researched factors, affective-attitudinal factors linked to mathematics learning are highlighted, due to the fact that they can strengthen, inhibit or block mathematics learning. Based on this evidence, it is highly relevant that early cycle teaching professionals add to their teaching practices different strategies and teaching resources to promote the development of Early Mathematical Competencies (EMC)*Not only relational but also numerical ones*And to strengthen logical intelligence. The binary logistical regression analysis performed (n=630) allows to infer that medium-high levels of logical intelligence, adequate levels of relational and numerical EMCs, a favorable predisposition towards mathematics, and low levels of perception of undisciplined behavior are factors that can greatly explain the probability of being part of the medium-high level category of mathematics achievement.

Advanced digital tools and computational evolution have shaped different areas, such as industrial process, communications, education and innovation. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things-IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, have boosted software development and computational skills in different areas. The chemical engineering knowledge acquired by senior students and programming skills can be integrated to develop computational tools, favoring chemical engineers to take advantage of new opportunities in digital area. Normally, programming courses are offered at the beginning of chemical engineering program, with examples not related to chemical engineering problems. To fill this gap, an elective discipline was created for final year undergraduate students in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of São Paulo (Brazil).

Its main goals are to identify the key characteristics that allow STEM educators to experiment with the usage of non-formal education approaches, and apply this knowledge to generate transformative learning experiences. It also seeks to develop new teaching skills among the participants as they train to create learning environments that challenge students to apply STEM knowledge to solve real life problems. A university in northern Mexico created a bilingual programme that allowed participating lecturers to be trained and take part in an outdoor experience in which they designed and applied challenging undertakings for their students. This in practice piece presents a brief description of a non-formal education workshop, and provides examples on how to conduct non formal educational activities based on formal curricular content. Preliminary results allow us to infer that participating lecturers were motivated to learn new teaching approaches in an active way. Participating scholars noted that they changed the way in which they delivered formal content and this allowed them to experiment with new activities that permitted their students to have a better understanding of STEM subjects and improve their academic performance. They also mentioned that the workshop enabled them to improve their attitude, leadership, social skills and class creativity. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","continuous professional development; non-formal education; outdoor education; STEM; University lecturers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041094592

In the nineteenth century, Sophus Lie developed a method of extracting symmetries that can be used effectively to reveal first integrals of a differential equation. These invariants can in some situations be identified by the Noether theorem or from manipulating the equations themselves with Lie transformations. Despite the formalism over conservation theorems for energy and linear/angular momentum, initial courses in classical mechanics often do not clearly or objectively highlight the relationship between conservation laws and the existence of possible Lie symmetries. For this reason, we seek to present an introduction to Lie symmetries using a language accessible to a graduate student in physics, mathematics, or engineering with basic mastery of classical mechanics in several variables. In order to illustrate the approach, we consider the classical problem of a spinning top with stationary precession. From the equations of motion, the Lie symmetries are identified and used in a transformation that results in an order reduction. The first integrals are obtained from this result using the Noether theorem, and we illustrate that the Lie symmetries for this problem are also Noether symmetries.

However, as we pointed out in this article, the images displayed by these pyramids, besides not being holograms in fact, are just two-dimensional images. We identified, however, a rich didactic potential in ""holographic"" pyramids for the teaching of Physics, especially when we consider the transition from the student's naive curiosity to epistemological curiosity and the teaching of certain concepts of optics and mathematics. Therefore, we built a quadrangular pyramid using acrylic plates and we made discussions about their operation. Through this article, we hope, among other things, to promote the critical awareness of teachers and students in the face of technological artifacts in constant changes around them, especially those considered as holograms. © by Sociedade Brasileira de Física.

One difficulty lies in the fact that activities occur predominantly in the daytime period, which imposes limitations on astronomical observation activities. However, the observation of the Sun creates possibilities for daytime experimentation that allows the study of important concepts related to astronomy and geometry. In general, this activity also provides an understanding of the movement of other stars on the celestial sphere. The main objective of this work is to present didactic resources for astronomy teaching. The target audience are the professors of teachers, especially in the areas of natural sciences, mathematics and physics. This article shows some low cost methodologies to perform analyzes of the movement of the Sun, from photographs or direct measurements of the image of the Sun projected by a small mirror.

The didactic problem addressed by this text is as follows: despite the recurrent information about the ""shifting"" of the near star relative to the background stars, as the Earth moves around the Sun, there is no clear indication of how this angle is measured in the sources consulted. Two approaches are suggested to address this problem: the first is an essentially geometric activity, to be developed by the students in the classroom environment. The second concerns a field photographic activity, in which the distance to terrestrial objects is determined by parallax.

For the last of these, it uses data produced by a survey on the Brazilian academic profession from 2007, which formed part of the international project the “Changing Academic Profession” (CAP project). The paper shows that contrary to international experience, in the Brazilian case, graduate education and not research came first. One of the factors explaining the success of Brazilian higher education in building a strong research profile is hidden in its success in building a strong tier of graduate education. Our analysis shows how graduate education in Brazil emerged in the 1970s as a by-product of the consensus built between political leaders, policy makers and the domestic leaders in the sciences around a project that puts science as a core policy for promoting the country’s economic development and independence. As this project grew, it created the necessary conditions for research to become institutionalized inside the small number of Brazilian universities that had succeeded in developing a robust tier of graduate education. © 2018, Hiroshima University,Research Institute for Higher Education.

One of the aims of medical student research is to close this gap. Accordingly, evaluating individual and environmental factors that influence participation of medical students in research are needed to understand and identify potential targets for action. This study aims to identify characteristics of medical student researchers in Colombia and the associated factors with scientific publications. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Colombian medical students involved in research using a validated, self-administered, online survey. The survey was distributed through the Colombian Association of Medical Students' Associations (ASCEMCOL). Data sets were analyzed using descriptive and summary statistics. Bivariate analysis and a multiple logistic regression model were conducted to identify predictors of scientific publications. Results: A total of 133 responses were analyzed from students at 12 Colombian cities and 20 higher-education institutions. Although 94% of responders had at least one research proposal, only 57% had completed a project, and 17% had published their findings. Barriers for undertaking research included time restrictions and a lack of mentorship. Motivational factors included opportunity to publish findings and good mentorship. Students planning to do a specialization (OR = 3.25; 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-8.30), innovators (OR = 3.52; 95%CI = 1.30-9.52) and committed (OR = 3.39; 95%CI = 1.02-11.29), those who had previously published their findings (OR 9.13 IC95% 2.57-32.48), and were further in their medical education (OR 2.26 IC95% 1.01-5.07), were more likely to publish scientific papers. Conclusions: Our findings describe medical students understanding of the process of conducting research in Colombia. Although there appears to be motivation to participate in research, very few students achieve publication. Barriers such as time constraints and mentorship seem to play a critical role. This highlights opportunities where barriers to research can be overcome in medical school and other levels. © 2017 The Author(s).","Education; Medical; Research; Scientists for health and research for development (MeSH); Students","adult; bivariate analysis; city; Colombia; cross-sectional study; environmental factor; female; human; human experiment; IC95; male; medical school; medical student; mentor; motivation; multivariate logistic regression analysis; publication; scientist; specialization; attitude to health; clinical trial; Colombia; cross-sectional study; education; epidemiology; evidence based medicine; medical education; medical research; medical student; multicenter study; personnel; practice guideline; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Biomedical Research; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Mentors; Periodicals as Topic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Research Personnel; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038113947

With this purpose, the paper reports on mathematization and use of mathematics, and deals with empirical data with focus on modeling activities performed by students in the first year and in the fourth year of a degree in mathematics. After the description of a theoretical framework of modelling, what can be seen by means of a qualitative analysis is that the perception of messy world situations leads to idealization, and the idealized situation acts as the basis for mathematization in each activity. The mathematization in turn leads to different mathematics concepts, tools and procedures. The use of mathematics that students perform is anchored in their previous experiences, be it in their experiences with the concepts and tools of mathematics, or in their experiences with mathematical modeling practices. Besides that, after this process students have advanced and have expanded their knowledge and made significant progress by means of a balance between teacher guidance and students’ independence. Moreover, beyond mathematical knowledge, the research indicated that success in performing modeling activities also requires knowledge-based mathematical modeling anticipation. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2017.",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This paper reports on a broad project funded by Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq, a public agency that aims to encourage and to finance research in Brazil) and conducted by me and Ph.D. students in the Ph.D. course in Science Teaching and Mathematics Education at a Brazilian university.

We presented an evaluation of the use of Maths educational software to support the learning of first-year primary students in the city of Mazatlan, Mexico. One of our reasons was to determine whether the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) would motivate students and make learning easier, more interesting and even fun. Three surveys were conducted wherein the following people participated: teachers who teach Maths in the first-year of primary school; managers of the computing facilities used in this study; and first-year primary students. Due to time constraints, the three surveys were only applied in three schools, in two shifts in each school. Overall, our study suggests three key aspects for learning to be improved through ICTs, namely: (1) learning activities should be designed considering the use of educational software; (2) learning materials and activities should include guiding material to facilitate learning; and (3) promote learning through play. We propose a few design principles for educational software to support learning better and more effectively. © 2017 by the authors.

This work was developed by using a case study as a methodological design. The participants of the study were 23 students enrolled in the Technical English I course from the Business Administration career and the International Business career of Universidad Técnica de Machala. The information was collected from direct observations conducted during the academic period of May-September 2017 and from two focus group discussions at the end of the semester. Thirteen participants were interviewed in the focus group, 13 students from the International Commerce career and 10 from the Business Administration career. For the focus groups, a questionnaire of three questions was applied which was previously validated by experts and aimed at exploring how the use of synonyms has helped the students learn English, its disadvantages, and which skills benefitted from the use of synonyms during the semester. The results of the study indicated that the students experienced an increase in vocabulary and improved their vocabulary comprehension. Synonym learning also helped them improve reading comprehension and writing skills. On the other hand, the students expressed that among the disadvantages of this technique, there are limitations related to the appropriate search of synonyms because of its multiple meanings. Similarly, another obstacle is the lack of vocabulary knowledge by learners which leads to employing too much time to find the synonym of a new term. Per the number of answers from students, the results reveal that the majority of participants consider that the use of synonyms brought more benefits than disadvantages to the learning of English language. In this way, it is concluded that the results of the present study confirm that the use of synonyms contributes positively to the learning of English as a foreign language. Hwever, it is necessary to consider factors that can condition its effectiveness such as the variety of multiplemeaning words and the proficiency level of students. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","Benefits; College students; Disadvantages; Reading comprehension; Synonyms; Vocabulary; Writing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057647768

Thirty-nine public school teachers (1st to 9th grade) were asked to formulate mathematical problems which resolution would involve multiplication and division. The results have shown that teachers understand what a multiplicative situation is and can formulate verbal problems appropriately. There were only a few cases where relevant information was omitted, or which contained language-related inaccuracies. It was also found that most of the problems were of the same type, and that their resolution required only one step. This lack of variety was observed among all teachers, regardless of the grade they taught. Thus, it has been concluded that teachers have difficulties in posing problems that make use of the various situations characteristic of the multiplicative structures field. It is, therefore, crucial to develop the elementary school teachers' ability to pose problems.","Elementary school teachers; Multiplicative structure; Posing mathematical problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040462752

A field trial with an intervention and control group was conducted in 14- to 15-year-old students in two secondary schools. The intervention was delivered via a website that included four educational sessions during a 4-week period and six 30-min class discussions during a 3-month period. In the control group, the investigators observed the general sex education provided by the school. Outcome variables were 1) knowledge about STIs, 2) attitudes regarding condom use, and 3) self-efficacy toward consistent condom use. Differences-in-differences (Diff-in-Diff) treatment effect was estimated for each outcome variable. There were 246 adolescents in the intervention group and 210 in the control group. The intervention had a positive effect on improving knowledge of STIs, attitudes and self-efficacy toward consistent condom use. The major effect was observed on adolescents' knowledge on STIs (Diff-in-Diff 30.34 points, P < 0.0001). A youth-friendly, culturally-contextualized, internet-based educational intervention complemented by class discussions may be a significant addition to the regular secondary school sex education program to improve knowledge of STIs, attitudes and self-efficacy toward consistent condom use among adolescents.

Procrastination is the act of delaying necessary tasks to the extreme of experiencing discomfort and negative consequences for the individuals. The presence of nontraditional students at universities is a phenomenon which has increased remarkably over the last decades. This type of university students finds some difficulties during their studies, which could result in a higher prevalence of procrastination behaviors among nontraditional college students. To test this, our work compares procrastination levels and reasons to procrastinate among traditional and nontraditional students Method. A sample of 479 Colombian college students was used. Procrastination and the reasons to procrastinate are measured by the Procrastination Assessment Scale - Students (PASS). The data analysis is based on descriptive statistics, exploratory factorial analysis, ttest for independent samples and Cohen's d. Results. Nontraditional students show higher procrastination levels (t=4,412; p < 0,001; d=0,459), although their reasons to procrastinate are similar to those of traditional students. The nontraditional student condition is a demographic variable relevant for explaining academic procrastination. Discussion and Conclusion. These results suggest the convenience of offering academic counseling and guidance to nontraditional students, to attend procrastination and thus reduce low achievement or dropout risks. © Universidad de Almería and Ilustre Coelgio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Academic counseling; Demographics; Higher Education; Nontraditional students; Procrastination",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035781138

There are a few methods to study inquiry's abilities in Chile, despite its importance in science education. This study analyzes the psychometric properties of a Scientific Inquiry Scale in pedagogy students of two Chilean universities. Method. The study uses an instrumental design with 325 students from 3 pedagogy majors. As a measurement instrument, it uses a scale based on one of the dimensions of Miranda's Tasks in Critical Thinking test. Descriptive statistics of reliability and dimensionality were used for the analysis. Results. The results show three items under the mean, two within the mean and three slightly over it, with adequate ranges of asymmetry and kurtosis. Dimensions analysis accounts for a three-factor model with good fit indicators, related to the three ability foci observed in this ability: exploration with three items related, comprehension with two items and inference with three items. The reliability analysis is adequate but lower than expected (.61) and an adequate level of interjudge consistency, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of.62. Discussion and Conclusion. Scientific Inquiry Scale is reliable and allows for analysis of the main elements of the ability to inquire, which is relevant for scientific reasoning.

A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today’s increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Decision support system; Expert system; Explanation; Knowledge-based system; Machine learning; Recommender system; Systematic review; Trust","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Expert systems; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Recommender systems; Taxonomies; Decision supports; Explanation; Fully automated; Software systems; Sophisticated machines; Systematic Review; Trust; Trust systems; Decision support systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030671275

This proposal responds to a need, identified in the literature, for “further research which uses alternative methods to understand student perspectives more fully, particularly in the context of innovative task design” (Ainley and Margolinas, Task design in mathematics education, Springer, Switzerland, 2015, p. 20). Influenced by enactivism, classroom cultures are characterised through patterns in students’ effective behaviours. Mathematics learning is defined as changes in effective behaviours which result from noticing features such as mathematical structure and which allow the learner to act differently in a given mathematical context. The following aspects were used as starting points to explore students’ behaviours and to characterise different cultures: active/passive, attentive/inattentive, working with others/working individually, freedom/constraint, giving correct answers/formulating explanations, knowing how and knowing why/remembering. Examples from two large-scale Mexican projects show how different tasks emerge in different contexts and how this emergence is interconnected with different patterns in effective behaviours and with mathematics learning. Characterising classroom cultures and sharing different ways of working in the classroom, which might give rise to different tasks, are offered as possibilities for taking students’ and teachers’ perspectives more fully into account in task design. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Enactivism; Mathematical tasks; Mathematics classroom culture; Mathematics learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043225328

Design ACGME case log information was retrospectively obtained for 5 cohorts of PGY-1 residents (2011-2015) and compared to the number of operative cases captured by an institutional automated operative case report system, Surgical Access Utility System (SAUS). SAUS automatically captures all surgical team members who are listed in the operative dictation for a given case, including interns. A paired t-test analysis was used to compare number of cases coded between the 2 systems. Setting Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. Participants PGY-1 general surgery trainees (interns) from the years 2011-2015. Results Forty-nine PGY-1 general surgery residents were identified over a 5-year period.

Conclusions ACGME case log data may not accurately reflect the actual operative experience of our PGY-1 residents. If such data holds true for other general surgery training programs, the true impact of duty hour regulations on operative volume may be unclear when using the ACGME case log data.

Further, fear of HCV infection is associated with discriminatory attitudes. The current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge about HCV infection amongst dental students and their attitudes towards patients infected with HCV. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst 340 Brazilian dental students from two public universities using an instrument containing information regarding demographic characteristics, knowledge of HCV and attitudes towards patients with HCV infection. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-tests, Mann–Whitney U-test and multiple logistic regression (MLR) were carried out (P < 0.05 was considered significant). Results: Response rate was 90% (n = 306), and more than half (54%, n = 165) of participants had high knowledge level (above the mean); 97.7% (n = 299) demonstrated positive attitudes. MLR showed that high knowledge of dental students regarding HCV was substantially influenced by advancement in year of study (last year; P < 0.001) and type of university (federal; P = 0.049). Positive attitude towards HCV-infected patients was mainly influenced by age (P = 0.004) and male gender (P = 0.022). Conclusions: These results demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge about HCV infection amongst dental students, but some gaps were observed, suggesting the importance of continuous education about HCV in this population to prevent HCV infection as well as discrimination and prejudice towards patients with hepatitis C. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The sample comprised 208 adults (104 teachers and 104 mothers). The adults were asked to tell 2 stories to the children, and these situations were recorded, transcribed, and codified using guidelines that identified 4 references to mental states (desires, cognitions, emotions, and attributes) and 4 references to nonmental states (causal and factual talk, physical states, and connections with the child’s life). Research Findings: The results showed significant differences between the educational staff and the mothers, and the teachers performed better than the mothers in terms of both greater mentalization and a greater number of references to desires, causal talk, emotions, and physical states.

The results showed a highly significant difference (p<0.0001) between genders in terms of the students' preferred subjects in secondary school, as well as between students from public and private schools in terms of their perception of the degree of subject difficulty. A relationship was found between males from private institutions and the preference for mathematics, physics, geometry, and calculus, and the inclination to study engineering; and a linking of biology and chemistry and an interest in natural science; as well as a relationship between a preference for Spanish and the inclination of females from public institutions to study education and social science. © 2017 Consejo Mexicano de Investigacion Educativa.

The msMLO faces the task of retrieving LOs via two steps: The first step ranks LOs using a unified learning style model and creates better LOs by merging the top-ranked LOs. The second step maps LOs onto a hierarchy of concepts to avoid duplicated topics. An experiment was conducted to evaluate this approach in an applied computing course. A total of 84 students were randomly split into four groups. The experimental results demonstrated that the msMLO is a promising approach that provides useful LOs based on students' learning styles and the merging process for reusing stored LOs. Furthermore, this approach improves overall student learning performance and reduces the number of LOs reviewed. © SAGE Publications.","aggregation; learning; learning objects retrieval; learning technologies",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029741262

This article presents evidence that certain physical environments do not allow equal visual interaction and, as a result, we derive a set of basic guiding principles that could contribute to the improvement of classroom design. Discussions about research on the design of classroom spaces and the methods to evaluate them articulate the rationale for this study. We seek to accomplish this by focusing on two fundamental variables of the face-to-face communication process: visual and distance. They are discussed in the context of four classroom case studies. The method is based on a hybrid approach composed of first-hand video-photographic records, isovist analysis and proxemic information regarding distances. The conclusions suggest that the proportion and spatial configuration of a classroom have a substantial impact on the number of pupils receiving high-quality visual interaction with the teacher. Finally, the importance of integrating experiential analysis in the architectural design process to ensure the quality and equality of the interaction among the protagonists of the teaching and learning process is highlighted. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Architectural design; Classroom environment; Experiential analysis; Pupil–teacher interaction; Schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019589612

(2) Was there gradual developmental growth of the most complex concepts’ networks of associated concepts from the beginning of a program to the end? That is, for the most complex concepts, did associated concepts begin to appear in the early grades, with gradual cumulative addition of associated concepts throughout the elementary grades? Gradual accumulation of associated concepts could enable students to progressively construct a mental network of concepts within which a more complex concept could be situated, a network that could facilitate learning of most complex concepts. Two best-selling, contemporary elementary-grades core science programs constituted the data source. The researchers employed two measures: a conceptual complexity measure and the number of associated concepts (called nodes in concept networks) for each of the most complex concepts. The researchers conducted multilevel modeling and found that, on the whole, the programs exposed students to increasingly complex concepts with the rise of grades. Few highly complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Similarly, few associated concepts for the most complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Instead, associated concepts tended to be introduced simultaneously with the most complex concepts in the later grades. That is, on the whole, the programs did not expose students to the opportunity to construct strong affiliated concept networks (clusters of associated constructs) prior to introduction of the most complex concepts. © 2017 International Literacy Association","art; Childhood; Content analyses; Content literacy; Domain knowledge; etc.); Specific subject areas (math; Vocabulary",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017405988

Grounded on a conception of proof that includes both empirical and deductive mathematical argumentations, we show the trajectories of some students progressing from developing basic empirical proofs towards developing deductive proofs and understanding the role of conjectures and proofs in mathematics.

This combination has allowed us to identify several emerging types of cognitive unity/rupture, corresponding to different ways of solving conjecture-and-proof problems.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge of basic statistical, epidemiological and research methods among medical residents of the National University of Asunción, and to evaluate the effect of individual characteristics on the knowledge of those methods. Materials and methods This was a cross sectional and observational study, of analytical prevalence, and non-probability sampling, which included 50 medical residents. An adapted version of the questionnaire on knowledge of epidemiology and statistics by Novack et al. was used, with permission of the authors. Pearson's correlation test, t test and ANOVA was used to establish relationships between the variables. Significance was established at P˂.05. Results The sample population included 52% males, and 36% were Family Medicine residents. A score greater than or equal to 60% (score considered as approved) was achieved by 4% of the participants. The mean of correct answers was 2.76 ± 1.66. A significant association was found between the reading of the “methodology” and “discussion” sections of scientific articles and the number of correct responses, as well as between gender and the score obtained. A positive correlation was also found between the year of residence and the number of scientific articles read. Conclusions The low level of knowledge that the medical residents, who participated in this study, have on the main elements of epidemiology, statistics and research methodology, is worrying, and highlights the need for an urgent review of the academic curriculum. © 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Epidemiology; Knowledge; Medical residents; Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997605072

Correlating geometric objects with the simple molecular model representation of organic compounds, the game promotes knowledge transposition to spatial recognition of chemical structures and chirality in formal education, classrooms, or nonformal educational settings (e.g., a science center or discovery center or university outreach setting).

Methods: The study applied Habicht's model to evaluate the adequacy and plausibility of continuing education by using as outcome the number of children with suspected cancer who were referred to the hospital of references in the 1 year before and 1 year after intervention and the number of patients referred by intervention group and control group family health strategy teams. Medical records from each hospital of reference were used to collect information of suspect cases of cancer. Descriptive analyses were performed using frequencies and mean values. Chi-square tests were used to assess statistically significant differences between the groups and periods by using p-values < 0.05. Results: The results showed a 30.6% increase in the number of children referred to the hospital of reference for suspected cancer in the post-intervention period; in addition, the family health strategy teams that underwent the intervention referred 3.6 times more number of children to hospital of references than did the control group. Only the intervention group showed an increase in the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions: This evaluation of a continuing education program for early identification of pediatric cancer showed that the program was adequate in achieving the established goals and that the results could be attributed to the program. © 2017 The Author(s).","Brazil; Child; Childhood cancer; Continuing education; Early detection of cancer; Non-governmental organization (NGO)","adolescent; child; early cancer diagnosis; education; family health; female; health care personnel; human; infant; male; medical education; neoplasm; patient referral; preschool child; program evaluation; standards; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Early Detection of Cancer; Education, Medical, Continuing; Family Health; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infant; Male; Neoplasms; Program Evaluation; Referral and Consultation",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028964861

Then, it addresses some political attributes of international tests so as to situate the debates beyond feasibility, attributes and scope-related issues. The article claims that the field of education testing has identified a number of issues and challenges stemming from diversity, and has developed methods and procedures to address many of them. From this viewpoint, testing is just like any other domain of scientific enquiry. However, international assessments of learning outcomes are not necessarily, or primarily, scientific endeavours; they are political devices and therefore should be scrutinised considering scientific attributes as well as some political features that, even if intertwined with technicalities, go well beyond them. Thus, critiques of international assessments would be better framed if their political attributes are taken as organising principles of the criticism, alongside those elements that pertain to their technical attributes, since these are not incidental but deeply interlinked. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural and linguistic diversity; educational testing; learning outcomes; politics of testing; standardised assessments",,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/M002187/1",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029068828

From the beginning of the century the number of enrollments tripled, reaching more than eight million students in 2015. Here we discuss some factors that converged to cause this expansion, and we try to indicate the main challenges of the Brazilian higher education system. We begin with a brief analysis of the federal program of loans for students enrolled in private institutions, and the program for increasing the number of places in public institutions. We then point out, in some detail, the current challenges that the Brazilian higher education system faces: i) maintenance of the pace of growth of enrollments; ii) improvement of efficacy, with a reduction of dropouts and a larger number of graduates; iii) development of access mechanisms; and iv) awareness of the diversity of the offer of post-secondary education in the country. Although these challenges are also present in most of the systems that made a move towards the democratization of access to higher education, in Brazil these challenges are faced in the context of a wide privatization and commodification of this level of education, together with a strong economic and fiscal crisis. Besides that, there is a rather strong valorization of a unique model of higher education based on the research university, which in fact corresponds to a small part of the national system.

To analyze the data collected, we used descriptive statistics. The results were interpreted based on the ""Technology Acceptance Model"" (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh et al., 2003; Venkatesh y Bala, 2008). It was found that teachers are convinced of the usefulness of ICT, due to the variety of resources provided to develop school practices, tailored to the training needs and the needs arising from the knowledge society.

This quasi-experimental study was performed with pre- and post-study tests given to one group, analyzing quantitative data through a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test and a non-parametric measure of rank correlation. Pre-service teachers were found to successfully learn vocabulary and concepts, but their perceptions about the degree of difficulty of teaching EFL and FL content remained basically the same as prior to the course. In addition, the correlation between the participants' level of English and their learning process was analyzed, as well as the correlation between English proficiency level and perception of the degree of difficulty of teaching EFL and FL content.

The research took place in the Province of Zambezia involving 12 teachers and the same number of secondary schools. The data was collected by means of interviews with scripts containing open-ended questions. The analysis of the interviews lead to the conclusion that the teachers comprehend that the provincial evaluations seek to essentially monitor the compliance of the teaching programs and familiarize students with external evaluations. The ones interviewed also observed that there is a greater weakness in the management of these exams. Considering that the teaching realities and contexts of the urban areas are different from the rural regions, the ones interviewed suggest that the exams be managed at district level.","Potentiality; Provincial evaluations; Teaching program; Weakness",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039165830

Two parallel, mixed gender, 12th grade classes of a high school run by the local university were chosen. One course was randomly selected to follow the experimental instruction, based on teacher and student activities contained in the ALOP Manual. The other course followed the traditional, teacher-centered, instruction previously practiced. Conceptual knowledge of the characteristics of image formation by plane mirrors and single convergent and divergent lenses was measured by applying, in both courses, the multiple-choice test, light and optics conceptual evaluation (LOCE). Measurement before instruction showed that initial knowledge was almost null, and therefore equivalent, in both courses. After instruction testing showed that the conceptual knowledge of students following the ALOP curricula more than doubled that achieved by students in the control course, a situation maintained throughout the six conceptual dimensions tested by the 34 questions of the LOCE test used in this experiment. Using a 60% performance level on the LOCE test as the threshold of satisfactory performance, most (about 90%) of the experimental group achieved this level - independent of initial knowledge, while no student following traditional instruction reached this level of understanding.

The majority of paper-based options can be classified as being either multiple-choice or constructed-response. Therefore, in the process of creating an educational drill-and-practice video game, one fundamental question to be answered is which is the most appropriate response format? This paper answers this question, proposing a hybrid format that we call fine-grained multiple-choice, where the player constructs their response one element at a time, with each element chosen from a pre-defined set. A comparative study was conducted with second grade students. When comparing the impact of an educational drill-and-practice video game that uses multiple-choice with one that uses fine-grained multiple-choice, we observe that the fine-grained multiple-choice game achieved better results. However, the multiple-choice game was substantially more successful at capturing the students' interest and motivation. Considering the widespread use of the multiple-choice format in game-based learning activities, as well as in interactive activities, this research suggests rethinking what the most suitable answer format might be for each area of the curriculum and for the different types of games. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arithmetic practice; constructed-response; drill-and-practice; educational video game; fine-grained multiple-choice; multiple-choice question; Response format",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1120177; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, UC","This work was supported by CONICYT - FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Cat?lica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapac?.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966715279

Thus, the way the educators in training manage the confrontation between discursive practices of different trends in the field of Mathematics Education and Indigenous Education outlines not only mathematics conceptions and its teaching in the indigenous school, but also possibilities of structuring and analyzing pedagogical proposals that they intend to adopt in their teaching activities.","Appropriation of social practices; Discursive practices; Indigenous education; School mathematics; Teacher training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030791012

The sample comprised 94 students from 3rd, 5th, and 7th grades, along with their parents, from a private school in Campinas (São Paulo, Brazil). Data were obtained through surveillance in classrooms, questionnaires, and scales, and were subjected to univariate, multivariate, and structural equation models (path-analysis). The results indicated that attitudes towards mathematics became more negative as students advanced in school years. Likewise, younger students achieved better performance. Girls had a generally more positive attitude towards mathematics, but worse self-perception about their achievements, even when achieving superior performance in comparison to boys. Statistically significant interactions with positive correlations were found between parents' attitudes and expectancies towards their children's academic performance and these children's self-beliefs and attitudes towards mathematics. Students' personal resources seem to act as moderating variables, since self-concept and control beliefs appear to have strong effects not only on attitude towards mathematics, but also on academic performance in this subject. This work also emphasizes the importance of the educational institution in the construction of positive attitudes throughout the school years, by promoting positive personal experiences related to mathematics, in addition to working collectively with families to increase students' own sense of competence and self-confidence.","Achievement in mathematics; Attitude towards mathematics; Family; Path-analysis; Self-beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030789761

We adopted the methodology of problem solving by Polya (2006), Dante (2009) among others, which allowed us not only to work with models of financial mathematics but to experience economic, social, and political issues in school. We use the parameters of the financial mathematics of Puccini (2007). We refer to several academics, members of the research group in Financial Mathematics as support for financial education and decision making, from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF), which is coordinated by Dr. Marco Aurélio Kistemann Junior. The explored contents of mathematics were functions and progressions, with an interdisciplinary approach. The subjects were high school students in basic education. Five activities were built with problems, approaching concepts, and financial calculations, from subjects such as savings and financing. Here, we present the analysis of two questions from activities one and two. Through the analysis of errors, a continuous improvement of the student's reflexive posture was evidenced, not only in the resolution of the financial problems by the calculations made, but also in the interpretation of the propositions under study. The results, resolutions, and interpretations obtained, confirmed the efficiency of the methodology used.","Financial education; Financial mathematics; Solving problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030774434

The empirical material was selected from articles published between 1995 and 2015. The analysis was oriented around four questions: What characteristics should a school curriculum based on an ethnomathematics perspective have? What should the didactic-mathematic knowledge of the professor be in order to attend to such a curriculum? What characteristics do the initial and continuing training courses from an ethnomathematics perspective have? and What theoretical and methodological and theoretical frameworks were used in the investigations? We concluded that the professor must have a creative and reflexive profile, be a researcher, and someone capable of developing a curriculum open to other rationalities; the formation courses teach about the nature of mathematics and the design of activities connected to culture and the methodologies are an important contribution to qualitative-interpretive research. We propose a model about the professional development of the professor and his/her relationship to other elements of the educational system, as well as a structure for a professor formation course from an Ethnomathematics perspective.","Cultural curriculum; Ethnomathematics; Mathematics teachers education; State of the art",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030768608

She solved problems, which involved the use of decimal numbers and their basic operations. Francisca chose from a questionnaire in which she evidenced an adequate overall performance although not without errors. Two follow-up instruments were used in Francisca's case: questionnaire and interview; the latter and some of its dialogs were the fundamental support of this research. Our general research question was: how does the adult assign sense to decimal numbers in the resolution of problems with those numbers? Francisca signified such numbers through familiar situations of life and working experiences. In problem solving, she assigned decimal numbers establishing equivalence between those numbers and mainly natural numbers, while she linked secondly decimal numbers with fractions. When this young woman produced new problems, she favored the use of money and length measures represented by the decimal metric system. Some of Francisca's difficulties were referred to the interpretations of the decimal positions and decimal notations. Also, she made mistakes in reading, writing, or in operations linked to certain unstable positional notions.","Decimal point (decimal comma); Decimals; Problem solving; Sense; Signification",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030752248

For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers' feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science. © 2017 ACM.","Agile methods; Computational thinking; Framework; K-12; Software engineering","Education; Network function virtualization; Software engineering; Students; Agile methods; Agile software engineering; Computational thinkings; Educational objectives; Framework; Multi-disciplinary activities; Principles and practices; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028598804

Learning about their experiences at school is crucial to assist them in this challenging task. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with children with T1DM, aged between 7 and 12. A scenario was created and puppets were used during the interviews to help the participating children to communicate about school, daily routines, and experiences in diabetes management. Data were collected over a period of 1 year and analyzed according to content analysis procedures. RESULTS: Nineteen children, 13 boys and 6 girls, at the mean age of 9.8 ± 1.8 years and mean time since diagnosis of 3.3 years, participated in the study. Three themes were identified: lack of information on T1DM, diabetes self-care at school, and support received by the children. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides useful information to understand the children's experiences in managing the disease at school. The partnership between school staff, health teams, children with T1DM, and their families need to be enhanced to promote appropriate strategies that improve the management of diabetes in this setting. © 2017, American School Health Association","child health; pediatric nursing; school health services; type 1 diabetes","child; coping behavior; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; psychology; qualitative research; school; school health service; self care; self concept; social support; statistics and numerical data; student; verbal communication; Adaptation, Psychological; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Humans; Male; Narration; Qualitative Research; School Health Services; Schools; Self Care; Self Efficacy; Social Support; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021885003

The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB.

Schooling of older children, however, still shows room for improvement especially among the more vulnerable. Fortunately, during the last years a sizeable improvement in attendance rates for children aged 15 through 17 took place. This could be related to the 2006 National Education Law that made upper-secondary education compulsory. In this paper, instead, we claim that the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance, AUH) —a massive conditional cash transfer program implemented in 2009 in Argentina— may be mostly responsible for this improvement. Using a difference-in-difference strategy we estimate that the program accounts for a 3.9 percentage point increase in the probability of attending secondary school among eligible children aged 15 through 17. The impact seems to beled by boys and is more relevant for children living in larger families where the head of household has a lower educational level. © 2017, Arizona State University.

The present experiment aimed to evaluate transitivity and equivalence test results when, during training, some of the baseline relations among stimuli presented during tests were established under reject control and others were established under select control. Five participants had learned in a previous study to respond to conditional discriminations AB, BC, and CD under reject control and to DE and EF relations under select control. In the present investigation, such baseline-trained relations were reviewed and, after that, (1) one-node CE-transitivity and EC-equivalence tests, (2) two-node BE-transitivity and two-node EB-equivalence tests, and (3) four-node AF-transitivity and four-node FA-equivalence tests were carried out. Results suggest that during transitivity and equivalence tests involving one stimulus set related under reject and another under select control (CE and EC tests), participants scored high. Increasing the number of nodes involved during tests, however, resulted in variability. The possibility that the commonly observed failures of equivalence class formation may be the result of heterogeneous controlling relations among the stimuli comprising the set or putative equivalence class is discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Norwegian Association for Behavior Analysis.","equivalence relations; humans; MTS-OR; reject control; select control; stimulus control competition; Stimulus equivalence",,"University of North Texas, UNT; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2009/51176-6, BEX 0568/11-2; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 08/57705-8, 2014/50909-8, 465686/2014-1, 573972/2008-7","The present manuscript is part of the Ph.D. dissertation of the first author, supported by FAPESP (doctoral fellowship grant # 2009/51176-6) and CAPES/Fulbright (doctoral sandwich grant # BEX 0568/11-2) while at University of North Texas.

These model organisms harbour a set of 13 genes that codify an equal number of phenotypic features. These genes change randomly during replication, and mutant genes can have null, positive or negative effects on the organisms’ fitness, allowing to model effects of both selection pressures and drift on gene evolution. There are two versions of this program: version 1.6.x_haploid; focused on macroevolutionary events and depicting prokaryote-like organisms, and version 2.3.x_diploid that simulate diploid, sexually reproducing organisms, and it is more adequate to teach micro-evolution as well as key genetic concepts such as Mendel’s laws, epistasis, genetic linkage, genetic mapping among others. Different data sets can be collected periodically during running in order to perform further analyses. In addition, the complete genealogy of extant as well as extinct organisms can be recorded. EvoluZion is well suited for teaching evolutionary biology concepts to students of all levels in a pedagogic way. This is mainly due to three main program features: (i) its intuitive and simple graphical interface (ii) a visualisation similar to videogames (iii) flexible integration of a wide range of biological phenomena into a single simulation. © 2016 CONICET.","educational; Evolution; genetics; simulator; software",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984698951

As a quantitative research, of a descriptive nature, it discusses the data referring to MRC. Initially, a bibliographic survey was proposed in federal documents that regulate and characterize the school inclusion policy (Inclusive Education). Next, official data were collected from National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (INEP) and the Municipal Department of Education (SEMED/Manaus) regarding MRC numbers and Special Education students enrolled in common classes and in exclusive classes in Brazil and Manaus (2009-2015). We argue to discuss: 1) the number of Special Education students enrolled in Common Classes of Regular Education by District Zonal Division (DZD); And 2) the number of municipal schools that have MRC, distributed by DZD of urban and rural areas. The results revealed that the number of MRCs implemented in the municipal education network in the last three years (2014 to 2016) has been insufficient to meet the increase in enrollments of the target population of special education in regular education.

However, engineering undergraduate courses and textbooks normally cover only an introduction to these functions along with their basic properties, without tackling the rigorous mathematical framework of the theory of distributions. In this work, the Heaviside function is used to represent a square wave signal f(t), and the Dirac function appears when the derivative is calculated. The steps for obtaining f ′(t) compare a graphical method with analytical procedures that employ the chain rule. The topic is further extended with the presentation of a theorem and a proposed corollary related to the study of the chain rule applied to general functions involving H(t) and ?(t). Thus, the work provides an appropriate mathematical support for the intuitive graphical method of analysis, which is very familiar in engineering practice. © The Author(s) 2016.","chain rule; Dirac function; electric circuits; Generalized functions; Heaviside function","Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric tools; Graphic methods; Networks (circuits); Timing circuits; Analytical procedure; Chain rules; Dirac function; Engineering practices; Engineering undergraduates; Generalized functions; Heaviside functions; Mathematical frameworks; Functions",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021937245

In the context of attempts to address criticism that the sector is not free, public or high-quality enough, this article examines the association between education and its moral and ethical dimensions, and their separate yet complementary consideration alongside economic development, through the two centuries of the Chilean state’s existence. Since the beginning of the current decade, discontent with the framing and performance of higher education as a whole has grown. The overview traces this process not as fresh crisis, but part of a social question pondered repeatedly in the past and supported with varying success through educational and political initiatives. This historical (and historiographic) approach illuminates the limits of conceiving of higher education as either an economic good or as a human right, and an overlooked need to support its benefits through policy. Not simply an interpenetration with economic thinking, but also a lack of sufficient appreciation of Chile’s fundamental and singular character, present as challenges in understanding expanded access’s function and its prospective contribution to growing debates around ethics and inequality. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chile; Ethics and morals; Market; Massification; Moral economy; System expansion",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981283821

This study uses a questionnaire that incorporates, in addition to the overtime, information about how teachers use their time, identifying the type of activities they are involved in, and if they are involved individually or as a group. The results indicate that there is a robust positive relationship between the number of contracted non-teaching hours and teacher job satisfaction, and a negative relationship with respect to overtime.

The problematization of such scenario would lead to two premises, grounded on a general hypothesis for the analysis of the educational present. The first premise: nowadays, the educational or, to be more precise, educationalizing practises—since they would not deal only with the schooling effort, but also with the diffusion of a great number of pedagogical initiatives of non-formal character—consists in an efficient rationality of governing of oneself and others. The second premise is that such educationalizing movement consists not only in the expression but also in the typical modus operandi of the current governmentalization processes, which aim at a large-scale administration of the multiplicity of populations now in terms of a lifelong educatibility for the citizens. These two premises sustain the hypothesis that the present educational practises do not restrict themselves to the mere condition of reiterative apparatus of imperatives extrinsic to them, but have in fact cemented themselves as a generative locus of the veridiction/subjectivization games capable of overrunning the whole social space. © 2016 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","educationalization; Foucault; Governmentality",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978736587

For example, in the UK, 10%–25% of Gypsy children do not attend school regularly and have significantly higher levels of overall absence from school (percentage of half-day sessions missed) than pupils from other ethnic groups. In Portugal, available data on Gypsy children is sparse, yet data from one geographic region of the country reports high school failure (45%) and dropout rates (15%) among this population. The present study assessed the efficacy of a four-year intervention to promote Gypsy children's behavioural engagement and school success. Gypsy communities were contacted and 30 children participating in the four waves were randomly distributed into control and experimental groups. Every school day throughout four years, 16 children in the experimental group were called at home and invited to go to school. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated in four waves (at the end of each of the four school years), assessing behavioural engagement (i.e. school non-attendance, classroom behaviour) and school achievement (i.e. mathematics achievement, student progression).

The interviews explored the specific conjectured constructions that student were able to do, the ones they had difficulty doing, as well as unexpected mental constructions that students seemed to do.

The authors sought to examine the underlying constructs of two of the most widely used self-report instruments - Davis's Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy version for medical students (JSE-S) - plus, the distinctions and associations between these instruments. Method Between 2007 and 2014, the authors administered the IRI and JSE-S in three separate studies in five countries, (Brazil, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom). They collected data from 3,069 undergraduate medical students and performed exploratory factor analyses, correlation analyses, and multiple linear regression analyses. Results Exploratory factor analysis yielded identical results in each country, confirming the subscale structures of each instrument. Results of correlation analyses indicated significant but weak correlations (r = 0.313) between the total IRI and JSE-S scores. All intercorrelations of IRI and JSE-S subscale scores were statistically significant but weak (range r = -0.040 to 0.306). Multiple linear regression models revealed that the IRI subscales were weak predictors of all JSE-S subscale and total scores. The IRI subscales explained between 9.0% and 15.3% of variance for JSE-S subscales and 19.5% for JSE-S total score. Conclusions The IRI and JSE-S are only weakly related, suggesting that they may measure different constructs. To better understand this distinction, more studies using both instruments and involving students at different stages in their medical education, as well as more longitudinal and qualitative studies, are needed. © by the Association of American Medical Colleges.

The database comes from the SAEB statistics, in Portuguese and Mathematics, on fifth and ninth grades. The results indicate the importance of the socioeconomic status in determining educational opportunities and the existence of three evolution patterns concerning the access to qualified teachers from 2001 to 2011.

The aim of this study was to describe the number, geographical distribution, and general characteristics of gerontological training programs offered by Latin American universities and to analyze their disciplinary content and the degree of similarity among programs. One hundred undergraduate and postgraduate programs with gerontological content were found to be offered by Latin American universities. Information on the institutional affiliation, academic level, management, length, and content of the programs was analyzed. Descriptive statistics were run and content analysis was performed on the programs’ syllabuses to address the objectives of the study. Results show that despite being a relatively young region of the world, the majority of Latin American universities offer gerontological programs. However, the nature of this course offering seems to be quite diverse across countries. Moreover, the analysis of the programs’ disciplinary content indicates that the program providers take a multidisciplinary approach to gerontology. The great diversity of programs and their multidisciplinary contents suggest a low degree of standardization of gerontological training in Latin America. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,"content analysis; geographic distribution; gerontology; human; postgraduate student; South and Central America; standardization; statistics; training; university","Asociación Universitaria Iberoamericana de Postgrado, AUIP","For her participation, M.

It aims to evidence that some practices of this period were focused on teaching numbers and operations by prioritizing the development of mental operations to favor games of truth about mathematics teaching in the constitution of teachers and students. The material here analyzed is part of the curriculum of the High School Teacher Education Course in a country school in Rio Grande do Sul. It consists of an interview with a teacher that worked with Didactics of Mathematics, four questionnaires answered by teachers that worked in that school in the 1990s, and the book Mathematics for early grades. By analyzing the materials with the use of Foucault's studies, we show that some truths have been produced as unquestionable in practices involving mathematics teaching for the constitution of teachers and students, particularly those aimed at the development of mental processes and logical reasoning. These practices have led to some truths concerning mathematics teaching and early-grade teacher education by legitimizing the idea of teaching for the development of mental operations of abstraction and logical-mathematical knowledge through the use of concrete material, often leaving aside the specific mathematical knowledge, because the government of souls has become more important. © 2017 Curriculo sem Fronteiras.

Theories are interpreted as research praxeologies, and different modalities of “dialogues” between research praxeologies are proposed, based on alternatively considering the main features and proposals of one theory from the perspective of the other. To illustrate this networking methodology, we initiate a dialogue between APOS (action-process-object-schema) and the ATD itself. It starts from the theoretical component of both research praxeologies followed by the technological and technical ones. Both dialogue modalities and the resulting insights are illustrated, and the elements of APOS and the ATD that the dialogue can promote and develop are underlined. The results found indicate that a complete dialogue taking into account all components of research praxeologies appears as an unavoidable step in the networking of research praxeologies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anthropological theory of the didactic; APOS; Networking methodology; Research praxeology; Theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991716218

The role of the medical schools in reducing health inequality has not been systematically explored. Methods: A qualitative framework method was used to explore the meaning, barriers, and facilitators of the concept of the social accountability of medical schools in Latin America. Twenty nine Latin American academic leaders from seven countries participated in an expert panel discussion. The Atlas ti.7 software was used to analyze the information. Results: Social accountability was identified as a core dimension of the mission of medical schools. The panel identified a gradient of three dimensions associated with social accountability. First, a formative dimension related to student selection, curricular structure and community based learning initiatives. Second, a societal dimension associated with institutional mission, community partnerships, and social research projects. Third, a political dimension related with involvement in health policies and primary care engagement. Lack of accreditation standards was identified as a main barrier to improve social accountability. Conclusions: Latin American leaders consider that medical schools should develop specific formative, societal, and political initiatives in order to be socially accountable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"accreditation; health care policy; human; human experiment; leadership; learning; medical school; primary medical care; software; South and Central America; student; curriculum; health disparity; politics; primary health care; social responsibility; South and Central America; standards; United States; Accreditation; Curriculum; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Latin America; Politics; Primary Health Care; Schools, Medical; Social Responsibility; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014932108

Our results show the importance of addressing the issue of student selection into programs and institutions in order to reduce selection bias, and they provide suggestive evidence in favor of using FE models. Our findings also confirm our hypotheses that rankings of specific college-program combinations change depending on the different educational and labor outcome measures considered. This finding emphasizes the need to use complementary indicators related to the mission of the specific postsecondary institutions that are being ranked. Given the sensitivity of the models to different model specifications, it is not clear whether they should be used to make any high-stakes decisions in higher education.

Objective: To associate the academic antecedents of first-year Dentistry students and their burnout levels. Method: A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were applied to students, after an informed consent process, to a sample of 79 first-year Dentistry students at the University of Concepción, obtained through non-probabilistic sampling by accessibility. From the university database, information was obtained as based on the academic antecedents of the participants. Results: Statistically significant relationships were found between the scores of university admission tests in Mathematics and emotional exhaustion levels, as well as lack of personal achievement; and between average secondary school grades and emotional exhaustion levels (p< 0.05). Also, the academic antecedents provided statistically significant predictions for the emotional exhaustion factor (p< 0.05), accounting for its 10.5 % variation, where only the average secondary education score (p< 0.05) was a statistically significant predictor explaining that 6.59 % of the variation in the emotional exhaustion level.

One element to take into account for their personalization is to determine the styles with which the students learn. Objective: To socialize the results of an experience in the instructive adjustment of a distance postgraduate course to the learning styles of the students. Methods: The experiment was carried out from October 2015 to February 2016. The Virtual Health Classroom (VHC) was used in Cuba, located at http://aulavirtual.sld.cu/. Learning styles were determined using the Honey-Alonso questionnaire. The students were divided into two subgroups: one active and pragmatic, and the other reflective and theoretical. The learning activities were adapted to the styles of the students. The processes and interactions that took place in the course were systematically observed and a satisfaction survey was applied. Mathematical-statistical methods were used: descriptive statistics, Crombach's Alpha, T-test, Chi-square, and Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: Active, reflective, and pragmatic learning styles are found in the standard of moderate preference, in students and for the theoretical style, in the standard of preference as high; there were no gender differences. Students in both subgroups approved all learning activities. The students showed satisfaction with the evaluated elements of the course, with no differences between subgroups or styles. © 2017, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

Objective: To evaluate the satisfaction of the students of the Master Course in Pharmacoepidemiology with the use of the virtual classroom. Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional study was carried out in July-August 2015; the universe was made up by 49 students, who graduated in the second edition and the current edition of the Master Course; we measured satisfaction with the virtual classroom, expressed as high or low according to responses to an applied survey. Results: The predominance of the response was ""access to the virtual platform is normal"" (38.8 %); 46.0 % considered the distance phase of the courses useful; 77.6 % qualified the time dedicated to activities in the virtual classroom; 57.1 % access more from their work centers to the virtual classroom, and most of them (61.2 %) prefer that the courses be developed with the support of the virtual classroom; all this led to assess the satisfaction of students with the virtual classroom as high, with 51.0 %. Conclusions: Although most students of the Master Course in Pharmacoepidemiology reported high satisfaction with the virtual classroom as a support for on-site teaching, a fair number of them are not satisfied; it is necessary to go deeper into the subject in future research. © 2017, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

One of the trails followed the traditional way of guidance with knowledge transmission from the guide to the visitor (GT). The other one used the Trails of Inquiry methodology, based on the knowledge building by the visitor, eased by the guide (SI). A larger percentage of attentive children, children that reflexively participated of the observations, and those that made reflexive comments about what they observed in relation to their own close environment. There was no difference between groups in the percentage of children participating in relation to the observations. Furthermore, there was no quantitative difference in the number of answers about either newly acquired knowledge, or changes that children could do for their own environment, but there was a qualitative difference.

It is considered globally as the most relevant arboviral disease and has established itself in Argentina, with great social and epidemiological significance, particularly during epidemics. This year, 2016, around 40,000 cases were reported officially (largest number in history) and the issue was intensely covered by mass media. In the context of an educational research approach to dengue and based on empirical information gathered in teacher training processes, we analyzed the social representations of teachers. The teacher training processes were implemented in two different provinces, one with low incidence and the other with high transmission levels. In the results, we identify a common pattern; a bias towards the biomedical dimension, wherein mosquito and symptoms, among others, were the most strongly associated images to dengue. This constituted a starting point upon which, after collective work, other dimensions emerged with more strength, particularly the political and, to a lesser extent, the sociocultural, linked to information and its social circulation. Finally, in the activities developed for the educational contexts of each teacher, we identified a high frequency of proposals related mainly to the dissemination of information and only the biomedical and sociocultural dimensions, almost with equal weight. Thus, the content of teachers' representations in both contexts would be mainly characterized by the biomedical dimension, whereas multidimensionality, which incorporates political, sociocultural and other notions, although with less weight, would become more relevant in the high transmission context. The possibility of bringing these dimensions into play during the workshops was facilitated by the didactical approach, group work and positioning in different social roles. Results suggest the challenge of continuing this line of work towards developing training spaces that encourage critical and transformative educational approaches.","Dengue; Social representations; Teacher training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024473619

Fifteen teachers and the same number of family caregivers of children with PD took part on this study. Two semi-structured interview scripts were used for data collection, each one for a distinct group (teachers and family caregivers). The interviews were recorded and transcribed for further analysis and categorization. The results suggest that the teacher, in many cases, does not adjust the HW to suit the demands of the student, or does not provide the same amount of HW for the student with PD than does for other students. Regarding the families, the results indicate that they perceive the child’s difficulties and at the same time, anguish over with the lack of communication with the school, which leads to concerns and doubts about the performance of the student. The results of this study may be useful in the context of inclusive education, because a well-managed HW can acquire a particularly interesting function as a mediator between school and family. © 2017, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

Using the opinions of medical residents an attempt was made to determine the teacher performance and the educational process in clinical settings. Objective The objective was to assign a grade to the teachers in three areas: interaction in academic and welfare activities, supervision of medical practice and professionalism. Material and method A 29 items questionnaire with Likert response options was developed, validated and applied online to 8,742 registered residents of 78 specialties in the 2014-2015 courses. A response was received from a total of 2,604 residents from 101 medical units (clinics and hospitals), who evaluated 1,173 teachers. The number of registered assessments was 9,591. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data and assign grades. Results About 85% of residents were grouped in surgical and clinical areas, with 78% reporting being satisfied or very satisfied with their education. The surgical area was the best evaluated, followed by clinical specialties. Residents of more advanced levels gave high scores. Discussion There was agreement with studies conducted in other hospitals on the high score of the surgical area. Conclusions This multicentre study provided useful data, such as the mean score by areas and specialties. The opinion of students is only one aspect among several to consider when evaluating teacher performance, but contributes to accountability and raising the quality of vocational training. © 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Academic interaction; Academic supervision; Faculty assessment; Medical specialties; Mexico; Performance; Professionalism; Residents review",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997830852

With this change, the reputation of academic institutions became important in all countries around the globe. In Brazil, the Coordination of Betterment of People in Higher Education (CAPES) is the governmental organ responsible for the process of evaluation of higher education, which produces a report and attributes grades to all Post-Graduate Programs around the nation. In this paper, we have analyzed the universe of attributed grades from 2004 to 2013. Our goal was to find patterns and possible biases in the evaluation process. We have found two important patterns. One refers to the higher likelihood of obtaining a higher grade if you are located in the Southeast. The other has to do with the administrative nature of universities. Public institutions are privileged by CAPES in the process of evaluation. Particularly, federal universities are many times more likely to achieve higher grades in some cases. This produces a disincentive to newer and private institutions, which have been fulfilling the role of expanding higher education in Brazil. © Copyright © 2017 Barbosa, Quoniam, Maccari and Nogueira Ferraz.","Brazil; CAPES; education; evaluation; Post-graduate Programs",,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR; Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care - Greater Manchester, CLAHRC GM","EB is currently supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames at Bart’s Health NHS Trust.

In order to broaden understanding, a moderation analysis of the model was conducted and it was found that the direct negative effect occurs under limited conditions, since the procrastination influence happens only among subjects with a low sense of power (H2). Therefore, the present results enhance the study of procrastination influence on academic performance by highlighting its relation with the moderating role of the sense of power. © 2017, Arizona State University.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students, teachers of the municipal and state education networks participated in the training. In order to accompany the trainers on the TelEduc platform and to minister the workshops, 5 trainers (masters and doctoral students) were selected from the mathematics teaching research axis. The data presented were collected from the reports of the trainees and trainers in the discussion forums, portfolios on the platform and also from the observations during the mathematics workshops. Consequently, we aim for a teaching formation that involves not only understanding of the content, because discussions about curriculum and quality teaching are essential for the achievement of teaching practice. Indeed, the teachers and trainers consider that the training was important for their professional growth and that the experience of the SF gave them to think the practice from a learning by doing. We conclude that a formation in the assumptions of SF leads to a path that leads thought to action, and therefore we understand that in this walk, the methodology lived proved to be efficient. © 2018, Edicoes Universitarias Lusofonas.

However, adequate pain assessment is still flawed, a fact that is partly related to gaps in professional learning on this topic. Innovative strategies such as the use of a virtual learning object mediated by persuasive technology in the learning of undergraduate nursing students can help to fill these gaps and to provide different ways of learning to learn. Objective To evaluate the results in learning among undergraduate nursing students about assessment of acute pain in adults and newborns, before and after an online educational intervention. Design This is a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent study using pre-and post-testing. Setting Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Participants 75 undergraduate nursing students. Methods Our study was conducted in three steps (pre-test, education intervention, post-test). Data were collected from November 2013 to February 2014. The educational intervention was performed using online access to virtual learning object about acute pain assessment, which students accessed on their mobile devices. Conclusion A significant difference was seen in student learning (p < 0.001) in the post-test compared with the pre-test results. The students understood the importance of the topic, and were satisfied and motivated by the technology and method applied.

Over the past few years, many researchers have turned to teacher-related variables as a way to better understand classroom processes that may help increase learning levels among students. In this study, we analyze one of these, that falls under what Shulman (Educational Researcher, 15 (2), 4–14, 1986) called pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Specifically, in this study, we analyze one of the areas of PCK which is knowledge of content and students. This was measured through a test where teachers were asked to explain students’ mistakes and predict responses in similar mathematics exercises. We explore if PCK is associated with the socioeconomic status of children and if it has an effect on children’s achievement. Additionally, we analyze which teacher characteristics are associated with higher scores in PCK. The analysis uses the Young Lives longitudinal survey for Peru. We found that students’ socioeconomic status at age 1 and maternal education were positively associated with their teachers’ PCK by the time students were enrolled in fourth grade, thus depicting a very unequal education system. Furthermore, teachers’ PCK was positively associated with student achievement, but only when a threshold for the PCK test was established. For our sample, male teachers, who were younger, and Spanish speakers had higher PCK scores. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Longitudinal study; Mathematics achievement; Pedagogical content knowledge; Peru; Socioeconomic status",,"Department for International Development, UK Government, DFID","Preparation of this study was funded by UK aid from the Department for International Development (DFID) and co-funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2010 to 2014 and by Irish Aid from 2014 to 2015.

Our assumption is that an important task for young children’s education is to create a democratic and critical environment, in which multiplicity of perspectives is celebrated, along with diversity of concepts and practices, with movement between imaginary and real worlds. In light of this, the goal of this article is to defend a perspective for curriculum and for the role of the mathematics educator, promoting the learning of mathematics through problem solving in early childhood years. In order to discuss and illustrate this perspective we describe the pedagogical practices of two teachers who teach 4- and 5-years-olds, who create for their students an environment rich in problem solving and investigations. In both classrooms, all children individually succeeded in sharing their unique solutions and new knowledge constructed as a result of their inquiries. The experience provides evidence that problem solving affords children the opportunity to raise conjectures, to discuss possibilities and to draw conclusions, even if partial ones, that are then vetted by the group as the authors share their solutions. In this way, the work with problem solving nurtures cooperative learning and promotes the exploration of a diversity of ideas. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Curriculum; Early childhood education; Mathematics education; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958245683

At school, teachers may have a long-term impact on students’ well-being. The objective of this study was to determine if interactive games stimulate learning and significantly increase fourth graders’ knowledge about healthy eating. The methodology consisted of designing four interactive games focused on a particular nutritional topic, which were later were played by the fourth graders [29 students from a municipal school (sample S1), and 36 students from a subsidized private school (sample S2)] in the district (comuna) of Villa Alemana, Chile. A questionnaire assessed pre-intervention knowledge and post-intervention learning as follows: fourth graders were asked to respond the questionnaire; then, they were split into 5-student groups and instructed in simple terms to play each of the games. Finally, the children responded the same questionnaire once again. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics; D’Agostino and Pearson test was used for the assessment of normality, and paired Student’s t test was used for comparison between means. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Regarding results, for sample 1, score means (±SEM) before and after playing were 6.93±0_80 and 11.83±0.95, respectively; p <0_001. For sample 2, score means before and after playing were 7.75±0.74 and 13.94±0.61, respectively, p<0.001. As concluding remarks, interactive games increase the learning of healthy eating habits among primary school students. Thus, they could be replicated in other contexts to impact the learning of healthy eating among students. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Healthy lifestyle habits; Interactive games; Nutritional knowledge; Primary school students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015779880

Figures suggest that about 24% of the population under 10 is overweight and 11% obese. The latter could be explained, among other factors, by children’s inadequate food intake and the underlying unhealthy eating habits inherited from their familial context, as well as the high number of snacks consumed (mainly candies). Hence the need to provide parents or guardians with the tools and knowledge to properly supervise what their children are eating. The objective of this work was to assess the knowledge of parents of students attending two Chilean private-subsidized schools regarding nutritional labelling in their children’s snacks. The methodology of this pilot study consisted in applying a survey to parents and guardians (N = 118) in the schools Colegio École Noel (n = 85) and Colegio Hispano Chileno (n = 33), located in the Metropolitan Region, Chile. The results of the study show that most respondents (58%) know what the labelling is, how to read and correctly interpret the food labelling. However, some (23%) face difficulties when choosing which product would be more beneficial or less unhealthy to their children. In conclusion, a higher proportion of parents know about food labelling; however, they fail to properly use label information in their choice of healthier snack for their children. In the future, a larger scale educational intervention is necessary for parents to understand the importance of examining food labelling to properly select food and snacks based on such information. These interventions would positively affect children feeding and decrease levels of child overweight and obesity. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Children obesity; Food labels; Parents; Snacks; Students",,"Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, UC","We thank to Colegio ?cole Noel and Colegio Hispano Chileno for permission to carry out this research.

Our main objectives were (a) to describe the knowledge of high school students from the province of Cordoba, Argentina with respect to native animal species, (b) to determine if any exotic species (introduced or domestic) are considered native, and (c) to analyze the effects of school sector and gender on the students’ knowledge of the native fauna. In total, 321 students aged 15–18 from 14 urban schools (8 state and 6 private schools) were asked to write down ten animals native to Córdoba, Argentina, in a free-list questionnaire. Relative frequencies and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to analyze the categorized (animal names) and continuous answers (quantity of responses, number of native animals, etc.), with the 25 most frequently mentioned species showing a predominance of native ones, of which “Puma” (Puma concolor) and “Andean condor” (Vultur gryphus) were the most prominent. An overrepresentation of mammalian species compared to other classes of chordates was also found, with high school students mentioning native and domestic species higher on the free-list. Using GLMM, we found that school sector had a significant effect on the number of native animals mentioned at both national and local levels, and on domestic and mixed species. Finally, male students mentioned more species and more native animals than their female counterparts. These findings were interpreted and discussed in light of sociocultural and traditional ecological knowledge theories, from which several implications arose related to research and practice. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Argentina; Biodiversity; Biological diversity; Fauna; State school; Traditional ecological knowledge",,"Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, UNC; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT: PICT-2011-0977; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, SECYT","We wish to thank all students and teachers for their collaboration.

In particular, the daily emotions of students in a mathematics class have been sparsely studied in the field of mathematics education. In order to fill this gap, this qualitative research aims to identify high school students’ emotional experiences in the mathematics classroom and identify the appraisal structures that support such emotional experiences. Focus group interviews were carried out until theoretical saturation of the data was achieved (N = 53 in nine focus groups interviews). Data analysis is based on the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies eliciting situations for each emotion and the variables that affect intensity. The emotional experiences in this structure are as follows: satisfaction, disappointment, hope, fear, joy, distress, boredom, interest, pride, reproach, self-reproach, like and dislike. These results show that the emotional experiences of students are based on their appraisals of events, objects and agents in terms of a structure of goals. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Appraisal structures; Emotions in mathematics classroom; Emotions in mathematics education; Goals; Students’ emotions; Theory of cognitive structure of emotions",,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 178564","The National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACYT, Basic Scientific Research 2012: 178564) and its Mixed Fund with the Government of the State of Guerrero supported this research.

It also can helps with accountability and marketing purposes. This study evaluated the impact of King's College London (KCL) Master of Science programme in Dental Public Health in terms of graduates' perceived learned skills and professional development. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to individuals who completed successfully the KCL Master of Science programme in Dental Public Health and had a valid email address. Participants provided information on demographic characteristics, perceived learned skills (intellectual, practical and generic) and professional development (type of organisation, position in the organisation and functions performed at work before and after the programme). Learned skills' scores were compared by demographic factors in multiple linear regression models, and the distribution of responses on career development was compared using nonparametric tests for paired groups. Results: Although all scores on learned skills were on the favourable side of the Likert scale, graduates reported higher scores for practical skills, followed by intellectual and generic skills. No differences in scores were found by sex, age, nationality or time since graduation. In terms of career development, there were significantly higher proportions of graduates working in higher education institutions and taking leadership/managerial roles in organisations as well as greater number and variety of functions at work after than before the programme. Conclusion: This online survey shows that the programme has had a positive impact on graduates in terms of perceived learned skills and professional development. © 2015 The Authors.

In the absence of validated intervention programs designed in the basis of traditional and alternative paradigms of education, it is needed to address the validation of an intervention program positioned in two different methodologies for teaching a sport like basketball. The design of this research is instrumental. The validation process was performed by expert judgment, wherein 17 expert judges should attend from four to six predetermined selection criteria. For content validity the coefficient V Aiken was used. The reliability of the instrument was calculated using the Cronbach á. The intervention program is equivalent to each methodology, as well as the number of tasks, contents and practical situations. After analyzing the data, 38 of the 40 tasks that make up the intervention program exceeded the values required for validity (V> 0.70). Two tasks were created within traditional methodology and those suggested by the experts qualitatively changed. The reliability of the instrument was excellent with a value of .96.

There are a few methods to study inquiry’s abilities in Chile, despite its importance in science education. This study analyzes the psychometric properties of a Scientific Inquiry Scale in pedagogy students of two Chilean universities. Method. The study uses an instrumental design with 325 students from 3 pedagogy majors. As a measurement instrument, it uses a scale based on one of the dimensions of Miranda’s Tasks in Critical Thinking test. Descriptive statistics of reliability and dimensionality were used for the analysis. Results. The results show three items under the mean, two within the mean and three slightly over it, with adequate ranges of asymmetry and kurtosis. Dimensions analysis accounts for a three-factor model with good fit indicators, related to the three ability foci observed in this ability: exploration with three items related, comprehension with two items and inference with three items. The reliability analysis is adequate but lower than expected (.61) and an adequate level of interjudge consistency, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of.62. Discussion and Conclusion. Scientific Inquiry Scale is reliable and allows for analysis of the main elements of the ability to inquire, which is relevant for scientific reasoning.

In this prospective study, 47 students voluntarily completed an informed consent and a self-report questionnaire to determine injuries and physical activity habits. Participants were instructed that every Monday of the semester should report any injury that occurred during the previous week, and to make a doctor's appointment for an accurate diagnostic. Results indicated that 31.8% of the first-year students (80% women, 30% men) entered the program already injured (p < 0.001). During the follow-up year, 59.5% of the student population reported a new injury. There were 37 new lesions, 24 (64.9%) in women and 13 (35.1%) in men, being the knee and thigh the most frequent injuries. These lesions occurred mainly in the extracurricular context.

It presents a number of occupational hazards that can affect both your health and the quality of teaching activity. Teaching activity is generally recognized by governments and organizations around the world. However, this sector often lacks proper attention on occupational health and, in many cases, their working conditions have to be improved. Objectives: To analyze Nicaraguan Secondary teachers' perception about their labor and social situation. Method: Non-experimental design, transectional and correlational. An ad hoc questionnaire to 157 subjects with 62 items was implemented. The validity of the questionnaire was achieved by piloting and validation process by experts. To analyze data, SPSS for Windows version 18.0 was used. Because nature of the data and research design, we conducted descriptive analysis and contrasts of hypothesis with nonparametric tests. Results: Nicaraguan Secondary Teachers feel recognized for their community and feel highly satisfied with their work. However, they consider living with a high prevalence of situations that threaten their health, poor physical conditions in places where they work and a health system that, in his opinion, does not meet their needs. Conclusions: The teaching vocation, social recognition and good relations between colleagues minimize teachers' risk perception. Teachers begin to be aware of their problems and health needs as they gain in experience; with more work experience, the greater the demand for resources and health care. It is highlighted that there is currently a need for specific training through preventive health programs, especially among younger teachers. © 2017 Universidad Central de Venezuela.","Health education; Occupational health and safety; Risk perception; Teaching profession",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047221751

Studies have shown the merits of social media use in educational settings; however, its adoption in health science education has been slow, and the contributing reasons remain unclear. Objective: This multidisciplinary study aimed to examine health science students' opinions on the use of social media in health science education and identify factors that may discourage its use. Methods: Data were collected from the Universitas 21 “Use of social media in health education” survey, distributed electronically among the health science staff and students from 8 universities in 7 countries. The 1640 student respondents were grouped as users or nonusers based on their reported frequency of social media use in their education. Results: Of the 1640 respondents, 1343 (81.89%) use social media in their education. Only 462 of the 1320 (35.00%) respondents have received specific social media training, and of those who have not, the majority (64.9%, 608/936) would like the opportunity. Users and nonusers reported the same 3 factors as the top barriers to their use of social media: uncertainty on policies, concerns about professionalism, and lack of support from the department. Nonusers reported all the barriers more frequently and almost half of nonusers reported not knowing how to incorporate social media into their learning. Among users, more than one fifth (20.5%, 50/243) of students who use social media “almost always” reported sharing clinical images without explicit permission. Conclusions: Our global, interdisciplinary study demonstrates that a significant number of students across all health science disciplines self-reported sharing clinical images inappropriately, and thus request the need for policies and training specific to social media use in health science education. © Elizabeth O'Sullivan, Emily Cutts, Sushma Kavikondala, Alejandra Salcedo, Karan D'Souza, Martin Hernandez-Torre, Claire Anderson, Agnes Tiwari, Kendall Ho, Jason Last.

Results show a medium permanent level of academic and recreational use of technology, within which only academic use shows a positive correlation with courses in areas such as calculus, algebra, and probability. Similarly, the academic use of video shows an elevated and constant use throughout the university years, correlating negatively with courses in areas including calculus and algebra.

Twelve undergraduate students were distributed in four triads. Two triads were exposed to a procedure that changes between conditions were signalized by different background colors of the screen. In other two triads there wasn’t signals of change. The experimental task used was the number insertion. In the beginning computer showed four random numbers. The participants would insert four numbers bellow of these numbers showed by computer. If the sum between numbers showed by computer and number inserted by participant were odd 15 points were added at individual score. This was the operant contingency. Beyond that, the computer added the four numbers inserted by each participant. If the sum of player 1 was lower than participant 2, which in turn should be lower than participant 3, so 15 bonus were increased in bonus score of each participant. This was the metacontingency. All triads were exposed to a design ABAB. During the condition A only operant contingencies were on. In condition B operant contingencies and metacontingencies were on. In the first condition A and all condition B stability criteria was produce 90% of the available consequences on condition. In the second condition A beyond 90% of reinforcements the culturants selected in condition B should happen at the same level of the first condition A. The result show that operants occurred in more than 90% of trials in all conditions. The culturants occurred in less than 35% of trials in condition A. In condition B the culturants occurred in more than 90% of trials. The return of condition A and the re-expose of condition B replicated the results found in the first exposition of each condition. The absence of signal has not produced differential effects in operants and culturants. That’s because the four triads have emitted operants and engage in culturants above the line of chance only when the metacontingencies were on. And the Triad 3 and Triad 4 showed that selection happened to both units without changes have been signaled. We concluded that selection of operants and culturants were selected by the consequences available. We discuss about possible effects of the use of the stability criteria. Since in this study the withdrawal of metacontingencies produced clear effects in culturants. Without cultural consequences the frequency of culturants dropped below of the line chance.","Cultural consequences; Culturant; Extinction; Metacontingency; Operant",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040456024

Yet, to boost competitiveness, it must be addressed the issue of how to foster cognitive ability in the overall population. A large body of literature has shown that it is the cognitive elite, those individuals at the far right side of the Bell Curve that most contribute to the positive relationship between cognitive ability and economic wealth. Despite this vast evidence, gifted and talented children are still lost in the standardized public education system path. They are not identified, diagnosed appropriately, or provided with the special education programs they require so their intellectual potential can flourish. The purpose of this empirical study is to test the association between high cognitive ability and economic wealth when mediated with three other variables: entrepreneurial abilities, competitiveness in education, and innovation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The empirical method employed is structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that among the three mediating variables, it is the entrepreneurship variable that plays a major role in explaining the relationship analyzed. Countries with a greater proportion of children scoring at or beyond 115IQ points, explain more of the variance in the two models tested. Governments and firms that are interested in becoming more competitive in the world economy should act promptly by investing in special education programs for gifted and talented children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040177869

The results obtained for the RMARS scale are: Bartlett's Test of Sphericity with KMO (0.689), χ 2 of 603.529 with 3 df and sig. 0.000 p &lt; 0.00, MSA Measure of Sampling Adequacy all more than &gt; 0.5, with an eigenvalue (2.219) which explains the 73.955 % of the total variance.

Non-formal education is a growing area, which has been given increasing attention and importance. However, in general, it is an ill-defined and ambiguous sector of knowledge in the sense that the terms used are polysemic and there is no consensus on their uses and definitions. In order to clarify the definitions of the different education typologies, including non-formal education, we asked: What characteristics do these education typologies have? What criteria or factors are used in the literature to define them? In order to answer these research questions, we conducted a literature review analyzing 28 national and international documents, by means of documentary analysis and content analysis techniques. We found that most of the national literature uses the terminology formal, non-formal, informal education. We confirmed the difficulty in defining and establishing boundaries between different education typologies and highlighted that their definitions involve a large number of factors of different natures. We investigated 21 factors used in the characterization of the different education typologies, divided into four analytical dimensions - structure, processes, purpose and content. We found that, despite the diversity of factors used in the definitions, a core set is adopted more often, associated mainly to structural characteristics, such as location, degree of planning, or duration of learning.","Educational typologies; Literature review; Non-formal education",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2012 / 23088-8","I-Research partially funded by São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP - number 2012 / 23088-8).

Based on the analysis of historical statistics on literacy and school enrollment as well as of documents that register the school transformations since the end of the 1800s, the article shows, first, that in both school systems, segmentation processes were and are based on the separation between public and private education rather than on differentiation of public schools curriculum. It shows also that while this type of segmentation is quite recent in Argentina, it is an old feature of the Brazilian school system. Finally, the article documents a progressive convergence between the two systems, as the private schools still offer a reserved space for the schooling of the Brazilian privileged groups and has increasingly played this role in Argentina in the last decades.","Educational inequalities; Private and public education; Segmentation of school systems",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 310926/2015-7, 446638/2014-5","The author II would like to acknowledge the research support received from CNPq (Proc. 310926/2015-7).

The movement of capital concentration can be observed through the number of mergers and acquisitions in the educational sector. Brazil is now credited with the largest higher education company in the world due to a merger between Kroton and Anhanguera groups. Together they have had more than 1 million students. It holds 16.5% of the market share. The financialization in Brazilian private higher education can be observed in two different movements: the acquisitions carried out by private equity funds and the opening of capital of educational companies (IPOs) on the Brazilian stock exchange, which has been taking place since 2007. The mechanisms of raising funds through the capital market allow the time-intensive capitalization of resources to subsidize the acquisitions and mergers, aiming at large-scale growth. There are more than 2,000 educational institutions, although, the four largest groups account for 34% of enrollments and 25% of net revenue. In conclusion, the process of financialization has fueled the concentration of capital in Brazilian private higher education.","Brazil; Capital concentration; Financialization; Private higher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034771478

Our starting point is that these policies should not be considered only educational policies, since they are also ways to symbolically reframe the place of some social groups (poor people and black people) in the national imaginary. With this objective, we propose to understand the transformations in university education over the last two decades (an increase in the number of students, social and ethnic-racial diversification of the student population etc.) as evidence of changes not only in universities but also in Brazilian society as a whole.","Affirmative Action; Education inequalities; Racism; University",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034770878

Behavioral measures about the ease or difficulty in learning certain repertoires could guide the selection of target behaviors and the development of a comprehensive intervention for individuals in such conditions. The Assessment of Basic Learning Abilities-Revised (ABLA-R) is an assessment tool that measures the current ability of a developmentally disabled individual to learn six tasks, referred as levels. Learning each level requires the establishment of a different type of stimulus control: A simple motor response (Level 1), a position discrimination (Level 2), a simple visual discrimination (Level 3), a visual quasi-identity matchingto-sample (Level 4), a visual-visual arbitrary matching-to-sample (Level 5), and an auditory-visual conditional discrimination (Level 6). The present article aims to characterize ABLA-R test, reviewing the empirical studies about its predictive validity and discuss the implications for practitioners in the field of Applied Behavior Analysis. The literature reviewed suggests that the ABLA-R levels are hierarchically organized (passing in higher levels imply in passing in lower levels, whereas failing in higher levels predicts failure in lower levels). Also, a great number of published studies indicated that the ABLA-R has predictive validity for predicting success in learning similar tasks that require the same type of discriminations assessed in the mastered ABLA-R levels. These results have important implications, as the selection of behavioral targets could be matched to the student's current ABLAR level to increase the probability of success in acquiring new skills and to reduce the likelihood of engaging in problem behavior. Therefore, the ABLA-R test could be a useful assessment tool for practitioners when selecting behavioral targets and defining some teaching procedures parameters (e.g., the use of visual or verbal prompts). However, the ABLA-R has some limitations. As the higher level assesses the ease to establish auditory-discriminations in a two-choice matching task, individuals with more complex verbal and relational repertoires may pass all six levels. Thus, the ABLA-R seems to be more appropriate for developmentally disabled individuals with limited verbal repertoires and lower functioning.","ABLA-R Test; Autism; Behavioral Assessment; Developmental Disability; Discriminative Learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034045735

Such psychiatric circumstances can impact several areas of an individual's life, from professional to interpersonal. Taking into consideration the need for psychological inter-vention for this population, an analytical behavioral group intervention program was developed for people diagnosed with BD, using Psych education strategies and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Therapeutic relationship was also used for analysis and intervention, considering the Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP). Besides bringing awareness to participants about the characteristics of BD and about the importance of the treatment, it was also relevant to help individuals learn how to deal with their feelings without trying to control them, defining life values and acting accordingly, both in the treatment context and natural environment The group had 5 participants and treatments were done in 10 weekly sessions of approximately 90 minutes each, conducted by two behavioral analysts therapists. The objective of this article was to describe the elaboration and application processes of the program, with a focus on the strategies used in each session and in the evaluation done by the participants about the format of the intervention. The majority of the strategies and metaphors used were developed and adapted by the researcher in partnership with other members responsible for the work. The flexibility provided by the ACT resources indicated that the therapy does not limit itself to the use of strategies and metaphors, as the principles they are based on can be broadened to the most different formats of therapy and show the ability to develop a behavior pattern. The adoption of FAP was essential for the decisions made in relation to the intervention planning so that they were coherent with the behavior shown by each participant. This condition favored the direct conditioning and the quality of the relationship among group members. The evaluation done by the participants and the research team made it possible to consider that the strategies and format used in the program were adequate to meet the group's needs, as well as to develop a pattern to deal with issues related to BD. Furthermore, considering the complexity of an intervention based on ACT and participants needs, it is possible to believe that an intervention with a higher number of sessions could be beneficial, allowing for a work with a more specific focus in each ACT aspect (acceptance, defusion, self as context, present moment, values and commitment). Such circumstance can help with important behavior conditioning in intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions for each participant, making it possible to develop healthy relationships and a better quality of life.","Acceptance And Commitment Therapy; And psychoeducation; Behavior Analysis; Bipolar Disorder; Group Intervention",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034044431

This article describes the current situation in the Information Systems career in the School of Informatics at the National University of Costa Rica (UNA). The problem of low female participation is analyzed in two dimensions: recruitment and retention. To study recruitment, we have analyzed the institutional indices of application and admission. To study retention, we have analyzed student achievement in the programming area, because it is considered a central area in the curriculum and an area of difficulty for students. The analysis is performed using data obtained from the UNA Registration Department in a period of 8 years, from 2007 to 2014. The findings support the worldwide results about the underrepresentation of women in the career. Permanency patterns are similar for both sex, and women tend to be more effective in graduating. Additionally, the first two courses of programming seem to represent difficulties for all students, but women tend to have lower performance. In general, the study aims to be a starting point to propose educational actions to improve the rates of representation and permanence of women in the career, while increasing the number of graduates in the area; an issue that is of institutional, national and international interest. © 2018 Universidad Nacional.

According to this view, remembering is a behavior that occurs in the interaction of man with his environment and therefore can be described and studied in terms of stimulus control relations. It is noted, however, that people may remember things different of the lived experience. Such a phenomenon has been termed as false memories. Through different research models, cognitive psychologists have produced a robust data body that allows affirming that this phenomenon is determined, at least in part, by semantic relations between stimuli. The two main paradigms used in those researches are the DRM Paradigm and the Misinformation Paradigm. In the first, a participant sees a list of words semantically related and later has to remember these words. Results consistently indicate participants remember words from the list and others that are also semantically related to those but were not presented in the list. In the second paradigm, a participant sees or read about an event and later answers questions about this event. In a question, a false implicit information is inserted. When asked to recall the previously observed event, participants usually report memories that contain elements that were not present in the original situation, but which have similar meanings to the implicit information provided by the experimenter. Considering these findings, behavioral analysts have, recently, begun to produce the first behavioral analogs of false memories. The main difference of the proposal of behavioral research is the use of the stimulus equivalence paradigm in addition to those traditionally used in cognitive psychology investigations, as a resource for the establishment and manipulation of semantic relations. The stimulus equivalence paradigm has been used with the DRM Paradigm in three investigations. In all of them the memory list is composed of stimuli from the same equivalence classes. Participants remember stimuli from the list and other stimuli from the same equivalence class as the ones in the list. One investigation was conducted using the misinformation and the stimulus equivalence paradigm. Participants first learned patterns of stimuli compound of geometric shapes. Later participants learned equivalence classes in which one of the stimuli were a shape from the pattern and the others were different shapes and a letter. When, in a recognition test, participants saw the original patterns; patterns compound of stimuli from the same equivalence classes; and patterns compound of new stimuli, they consistently recognize the originals and the ones formed of stimuli from equivalence classes as the original patterns. The results of the first behavioral researches point to the feasibility and adequacy of the use of the stimulus equivalence paradigm as a theoretical and methodological resource for the study of false memories. This gives rise to new possibilities of experimental manipulations that can originate a promising line of research.","Behavior Analysis; False Memories; Remembering; Stimulus Equivalence",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033456950

Ten children aged seven to nine, without clinical diagnosis, attended the first primary education cycle, participated. The tasks were based on matching-to-sample discrete trials, using printed or spoken sentences and figures. The sentences were composed of subject, verb and object. The words used in sentences and the difficulty of discrimination varied during the procedure. The variations were: sentences composed of simple words of the portuguese language, of the orthographic point of view, and comparisons with multiple differences between them; and critical differences simple words; complex words and multiple differences; and complex words and critical differences. Sentences comparisons with multiple differences had all the different words, and sentences comparisons with critical differences had a word or two in common with each other. Critical differences were used to increase the probability of choice responses controlled by all aspects of the sentence and not just part of it. Reading tests were performed before and after the application of the procedure. Nine of the ten participants showed a higher percentage of correct answers in the posttest than in the pretest that evaluated reading. The children had more errors in the teaching phases which sentences had used critical differences. The results showed that the children may have been under strict stimuli control and that the restriction of the number of exposure to teaching trials may have decreased the chances of better performance. In the Reading Test of recombinative generalization sentences, two of ten children showed high percentages of correct answers. The results suggest that the procedure promoted the learning of reading sentences during the teaching; however, it was not sufficient for recombinative generalization.","Children; Matching-to-sample; Reading comprehension; Reading sentences; Recombinative reading",,"573972/2008-7; Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Midas; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2008/57705-8","Superior (CAPES),sendo baseada na dissertação de mestrado da primeira autora.

Design/methodology/approach: As this paper is a comparative literature review, the methodology involved three stages. Initially, a documentary analysis was carried out to identify the texts published during the past five years – since 2013 – reporting a categorization of experiences and cases of international INFOLIT programs and their corresponding lessons learned. Second, we conducted a content analysis of these publications to uncover the classification, identification and frequency of the lessons learned. A third comparative step consisted of analyzing the similarities of these lessons when compared to those reported in similar research on Ibero-American universities (Uribe-Tirado, 2013). Findings: From the 75 lessons learned from INFOLIT programs in Ibero-American universities, 65 lessons (87 per cent) were identified as also present in universities elsewhere. These similarities give an account of the possibilities for collaborative learning and benchmarking that INFOLIT programs could achieve with regard to content, pedagogy, learning objects and evaluation if there were more networking and more common participation in sharing experiences, with appropriate adaptations to contextual, technological and idiomatic variations. Originality/value: As a comparative literature review, this paper makes a significant contribution to the international advancement of INFOLIT in higher education, as it correlates the lessons learned from INFOLIT programs in Ibero-American universities with those from other countries.

The dialogue practice of the prospective teachers was followed and the episodes from those practices constituted a first level of data. In moments of supervision and pedagogical imagination, the prospective teachers reflected on such episodes and their conversation constituted data about data. An episode about a prospective teacher's attempt to put the dialogue in action with her students is presented.

To collect the data, we used semi-structured questions: before, during and after the accomplishment of each challenge. The results showed that the interactions were mainly guided by cooperation. At the beginning of each challenge feelings such as interest, fear, and anxiety prevailed. As the students advanced in other challenges, sometimes being successful, sometimes making mistakes, the feelings aroused were joy, frustration, interest, fear, among others. We concluded that such feelings aroused the students' cognitive actions and even those who had not achieved a positive result persisted in the activities until the end, that is, nobody gave up and that happened due mainly to the instigating and interesting affective feature which Webquest encouraged within that context meant for learning mathematics.","Affectivity; The teaching of mathematics; Webquest",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030788349

The analysis of the action and production of signs in the activity indicates that the semiosis as an action that involves sign, object, and interpretant is not limited. Instead, this action and production revealed that the phenomenon and mathematics are inseparable and that seems to be set up as a network in which signs are produced or driven by knowledge and generate new knowledge.

From the Discourse Analysis in the perspective of this philosopher, we analyzed XI ENEM's annals (National Meeting of Mathematics Education) published studies. The statements that we highlight point to possible interweavings between the playful practices and the characteristics of neoliberalism, as the ability to build their own ideas, or think independently, be active in the construction of knowledge, have confidence, be an entrepreneur of himself, having freedom to make decisions, compete and be a consumer subject.

Data collection was done through narratives produced by the participants and the information was analize using the Discursive Textual Analysis - ATD method. The analysis allowed the emergence of three categories: Characterization of interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinarity as an illusion of change in the pedagogical space; Interdisciplinarity as a real possibility of change in the pedagogical space.

The relationship of the mathematics to different scientific disciplines motivates us to devise different treatments to find a solution for understanding and predicting what happens in nature In this way, other scientific areas call for new mathematics and these in turn provide new discoveries. Today there are several computational tools to develop learning units that enable allow understanding of different concepts. One is the Python language, which contains tools for numerical and symbolic calculations, and also for graphical visualisations with the advantage of being open and easy to learn. Currently, the Jupyter project is an environment in which different languages come together under one programming scheme. In this manuscript, we show how we have adapted 1 Python Notebook to show some simulations on some phenomena related to geometric problems, numerical calculation and its applications in mechanical and electromagnetic systems. In this way. the authors have designed a web site containing learning units based on examples of mathematical, physical and biological problems. © 2017 Research Information Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026643974

The evidence for content validity of the TAS was evaluated by ten referees, and this was followed by the analysis of the evidence for construct validity and reliability. The tetrachoric correlation matrix was submitted for exploratory factorial analysis, and the Hull method was used to decide the number of dimensions to be retained. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was performed using the rating scale model with the result that seven items needed to be excluded. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity indicated that the polychoric correlation matrix was factorable. The Hull method suggested the retention of a factor, with the eigenvalue of 15.49. The factor's reliability measures were α = 0.96 and ω = 0.95.

The results showed that by participating in the PDW, teachers weakened their ideas about mathematics being a rigid, structured and eminently formal process. Likewise, participation in the PDW also lessened teachers' perceptions of their leading roles during the learning process, increasing their appraisal of PS practices that are student-centered. It was also noted that teachers' perception that access to mathematics learning is a fixed condition or an unalterable fact associated with students' innate abilities, gender or ethnic stereotypes, also diminished. In addition, teachers reported improvements in their self-perception of competence and self-efficacy to implement PS in the classroom with their students.

In accordance with this context, we develop in this article, detailed and appropriate demonstrations for each case, in addition to present examples of endoérgicas and exoérgicas collisions.","Coefficient of restitution; Endoergic collision; Exoergic collision and types of collision",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020697177

The objective of this study is to measure the effect of incorporating a variable of predisposition to mathematical tasks to a complex model, which also considers the student’s formal and inductive logical reasoning skills regarding academic mathematics performance. Our aim is to assess to what extent success in mathematics provides feedback to students and how it influences overall academic achievement. In order to do so, different instruments were used, such as TOLT (Test of Logical Thinking), TILS (Test of Higher Logical Thinking) and a Likert-type scale to measure the predisposition for mathematical tasks. The interaction between variables was modeled using structural equations. The results show the important role that predisposition for mathematical tasks plays in academic performance. They also show how this predisposition interacts and modulates the effect of cognitive factors on overall academic performance, and how it also mitigates the strength of their univariate relationships. The educational role of these findings is discussed, as well as possible ways of improving a negative predisposition towards mathematical tasks in school environments. © 2017, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

For this, it explores the researcher's position as a teacher who works in detention units of Fundação CASA, where socio-educational measures provided by Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (ECA - Child and Adolescent Statute) are applied to adolescents who commit offenses. Involvement in the routine of the institution allows the narrative to be constructed in a symmetrical movement, in which the teacher can experience and be affected by the different devices that seek to territorialize the units. Because that is a social control environment marked by conflicting relations, symmetrical ethnographic description assumes a tense perspective, since in the teaching practice and the construction of bonds within the institution there is a number of risks and dangers, which can lead teachers to be coopted by normative forces of the collective of officials and adolescents. When this happens, the teacher fails to build a mediating attitude of symmetrization, and becomes an intermediary who strengthens the collectives that seek to dominate the institutional routine. Thus, teaching at Fundação CASA units is a risky exercise, in that at any time the teacher can become an arrastão or a lagarteado. In the first case, he becomes just another operator of institutional norms, and, on the second, the teacher loses the limit of involvement with adolescents and starts to act according to their will.","Ethnography; Fundação CASA; Socio-educational measures; Symmetry; Teaching practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020211474

The study concentrates on the problematics of the use of technology for mathematics teaching and its restricted use, which prevents real impact on mathematics learning. In this regard, the research's general objective is: to describe negotiated meanings (in terms of learning) in a community of practice of mathematics educators that incorporate digital technology in their professional practices. The investigation follows a qualitative methodology called collaborative action research. As for findings, we emphasized experiences with teachers of secondary education who have worked with the methodological model of Reflection-and-Action. This model revolves around the processes of reflection in action, reflection-for action, and reflection-on the action of the teachers who participate in the community of practice. We focused on teachers' reflections on building angles with the support of technology in a mathematics class with eighth graders. We concluded that the set of reflective processes reveals how the course of the class planned by teachers can change as a result of the concrete or virtual teaching resources that they select and use to promote mathematics activities for their students.","Community of practice; Digital technologies; Reflection; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020192393

The study was conducted with students at the city of Apucarana, Parana, Brazil. Initially, a lecture with a multimedia kit on the subject was presented, after it was shown and discussed some packets of biscuits originally from main market where trans fats were emphasized. Then groups of 4 people were formed to play the board game with cards. The explanation of the information “0% trans” is not zero, but up to 0.2 g of trans fat per portion was particularly important for students who showed in a biscuit brand where eating three units could get to have up to 30 g. The finding that eating three units accounted for 10% of the recommended total, the package containing 200g is 67% of the total recommended it was enough, in general, to alert the students, especially those who eat an entire package along the day. The game proved its importance increasing the debate and encouraging students to enhance learning.

The article's goal is, more specifically, to understand the process of decentralization of deaf education/literacy in Brazil, as well as the consequent creation of the first literacy classes for deaf children in Espírito Santo, with regard to the political and administrative aspects of this process. It adopts historical research, as well as documents/texts, as the central object of analysis. It builds on the conception of history proposed by Marc Bloch and on the Bakhtinian perspective on language to understand texts/ documents as an enunciation produced by subjects in their time. We conclude that the Campaign for Brazilian Deaf People's Education was fundamental to enable the economic and social project aimed at decentralizing schooling, as well as to ensure that a greater number of deaf people, until then excluded from the constitutional right to education, could learn the country's official language, which was literacy's central goal at the time. Decentralization of deaf education in Espírito Santo, in turn, has actually taken place, but it has largely depended on partnerships between public and private institutions. If, on the one hand, these partnerships have postponed schooling offer as a right, on the other hand, they have enabled the concrete conditions for the education of a group of people until then excluded from this process.","Deaf education; Decentralization; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015258928

Would it be a specialized program from the beginning or a regular initial program combined with continuing specialized training? The answers to these questions are not supported by evidence since there are few studies focusing on this problem or comparing different training approaches. However, even without evidence that continuing education is the best model, much has been invested in continuing education policies, particularly in distance learning programs with short courses. On the other hand, there are also initiatives by a few universities offering programs with specialized initial training. Thus, the present study aimed to identify, describe and analyze undergraduate programs in special education at both public and private universities, with regard to their pedagogical project, course schedule and discipline program. In this documentary-exploratory study, we analyzed ten undergraduate programs in special education offered by eight universities, two of which were public and six private. According to our document analysis, the courses' curricular frameworks have different characteristics since there are still no national curricular guidelines regulating the creation undergraduate programs in special education. Today, private institutions account for 75% of all universities offering these programs; however, the number of courses is insufficient for the needs of the Brazilian educational system.

Our purpose is to discuss the training of multipurpose teachers for children's education and for the early grades of elementary schools, starting with results of a research conducted in public and private institutions in the state of São Paulo, from 2012 to 2013, funded by CNPq - the National Research Council. For the quantitative approach, we utilized the technique of documental analysis over the set of 144 curriculum grids we were able to obtain. The grounds for the qualitative approach, data were analyzed by cross-checking the characteristics of the institutions with the characteristics of the discipline that make up their curriculum grids. Data reveal that most teacher education courses in the state of São Paulo are provided by private institutions, with minimum number of hours and research is not intrinsic with their characteristics. The interpretative analysis of results establishes that the Pedagogy courses investigated are affected by the same problems pointed out in the literature concerning DCNCP/2006: the vagueness of the pedagogical field and the scattering of the scope of pedagogy and the teacher's professional practice. Consequently, the majority of such courses are not fully training neither the educator nor the multipurpose teacher intended to work in child education (preschool) and the early grades of elementary school, as the education and training they get is fragile, superficial, generalizing, fragmented, dispersive and unfocused. In our conclusion alternatives are indicated in order overcome some of these problems.","Educator training; Multipurpose teacher; National curriculum guidelines; Pedagogy courses; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015208043

The study is grounded on the analysis of statistics derived from micro-data from the School Census of Compulsory Education in Rio Grande do Sul. Understanding that the guarantee to the right to education requires access, permanence and flow in school, we analyzed the number of enrollments of children and adolescents, considering their age and education level/modality, both in regular and special classes/ schools, with particular attention to secondary education. Statistics have shown that the percentage of students with disabilities who completed secondary education at the expected age (17 years old) is lower than 5% of the total number of enrollments in this age group in regular classes. In special education settings, this number decreases to 1% of the total number of enrollments. There is also retention of students with disabilities older than six years in early childhood education, as well as in the literacy cycle (1st to 3rd grade), a situation that is more serious in special classes/schools, and thus contradicts the national norms and guidelines.

To ensure quality in graduate programs, accreditation is compulsory. The current article presents a model to improve the process of self-regulation. The main objective was to design a Model of Quality Assurance for Postgraduate Programs in order to constitute a theoretical, mathematical, and informatics reference that would optimize the processes of self-regulation, self-evaluation, and accreditation of master and doctorate programs from the Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción, Chile. This descriptive research is based on a mixed methods approach. The proposal was intended through theoretical and empirical references related to the accreditation systems. The analysis process was conducted with key informants, and the informatics instrument was created and validated through expert judgment. After the analysis, the model was optimized considering the expert's suggestions. As a result of the optimization process, a matrix of eight dimensions was obtained and it is available online in order to be used by the heads of postgraduate programs. Finally, a model with four main stages was achieved in order to install a self-regulation and a self-evaluated culture that leads to accreditation as evidence of the quality of postgraduate programs.","Benchmark of quality; Digital technologies; Online platform; Postgraduate programs; Quality of education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014078987

The environment gives students the opportunity to interact with the cone and the plane as virtual objects in real time and real place. They can perceive their own creation of the different curves: parabola, circle, ellipse and hyperbola. A dynamical animation to visualize the focus and directrix of the parabola is presented by introducing the Dandelin Spheres into the virtual environment. Besides the motivational element it offers, the purpose is to promote an active learning through the affordances of augmented reality technology. Anxiety towards mathematics could be tackled if students comprehend the mathematical knowledge.

In light of this, the Gradual Immersion Method (GIM) was designed to enhance collaborative creativity using interactive devices and augmented reality (AR), to support creativity-based learning, such as in the integrated study of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). The GIM consists of three intuitive modules wherein learners collaboratively achieve learning object goals through interaction with images and 3D models, in a sequential transition from 2D to 3D and then to AR. In this paper, the process is illustrated through the deployment of the GIM in the study of Surrealist art features, using the Art Movement Learning App (AMLA), an area-specific technological solution based on the GIM, designed as foundation architecture for the investigation of a wide range of topics in an interactive manner. © Authors.","21st Century Skills; AMLA; AR; Creativity; GIM; STEAM",,"Universidad de Guadalajara, UDG; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","This research was supported by a postdoctoral research grant for 2014-2015 from the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT).

In general, the word chaos may refer to any state of confusion or disorder and it may also refer to mythology or philosophy. In science and mathematics it is understood as irregular behavior sensitive to initial conditions. In this article we analyze the deterministic chaos theory, a branch of mathematics and physics that deals with dynamical systems (nonlinear differential equations or mappings) with very peculiar properties. Fundamental concepts of the deterministic chaos theory are briefly analyzed and some illustrative examples of conservative and dissipative chaotic motions are introduced. Complementarily, we studied in details the chaotic motion of some dynamical systems described by differential equations and mappings. Relations between chaotic, stochastic and turbulent phenomena are also commented. © by Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Chaos theory; Differential equations; Lyapunov exponent; Mapping; Poincaré sections",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010683555

In this way, this paper aims to a statistical investigation about students' performances in Physics and in other disciplines. For this purpose, it was evaluated the correlations between student grades in Physics and in other curricula. In addition, it was developed a multilevel model with two hierarchical levels: the student and the classroom. In this model it was evaluated simultaneously the influence of some disciplines on the performance in Physics. Data used were obtained in two public schools from the cities of Ouro Preto and Campo Belo. It was tried to identify whether the performance in Mathematics and Natural Science, representing the logical and deductive reasoning, as well as the performance in Portuguese and Human Sciences, representing the ability of read and interpret, has some connection to the performance in Physics. The results have shown that the highest correlation values are found between the grades in Mathematics and Physics and between the average grades in Chemistry and Biology and the grades in Physics. Beyond that, when considering simultaneously the grades, it was found again that the proficiencies in Mathematics and Chemistry/Biology have a positive impact in Physics. The National Curriculum Parameters (PCN) aim to an integration of knowledge in theme, in which the Natural Sciences theme includs Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Thus, the results between Physics and the other disciplines in this theme point to interdisciplinary work and aligned with the PCN. © by Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Correlation; High school; Multilevel Model; Physics teaching; School performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010679772

Here this approach will lead us to the principle of minimization of the effective potential energy associated with the system.

If one aims at understanding what physics is about, recognise how experimental measurements and mathematical reasoning are intertwined is essential. In this work we exemplify such entanglement by analysing three case studies. In the first one, the explanation of the Hall effect underlines how we indirectly penetrate into the microscopic structure of a wire and manage to evaluate the number of charged particles per unit volume inside it from a set of macroscopic measurements. The second case shows how our reasoning allows us to determine the radius of a hydrogen atom from the experimental measure of the atom's binding energy. The third example comes from kinetic gas theory and illustrates how it is possible to estimate the number of gas particles per unit volume from the experimental values of pressure and temperature. These three case studies show that the equal sign of certain equations can be seen as a bridge (keyhole) connecting the empirical and theoretical dimensions.

It uses a large, university-wide data set to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis by using the case study method. It presents empirical findings about relationships between student behaviours in a learning management system (LMS) and the learning outcomes of students, and further explores these findings using process modelling techniques. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes a two-year study in a Chilean university, using big data from a LMS and from the central university database of student results and demographics. Descriptive statistics of LMS use in different years presents an overall picture of student use of the system. Process mining is described as an event-centred approach to give a deeper level of understanding of these findings. Findings: The study found evidence to support the idea that instructors do not strongly influence student use of an LMS. It replicates existing studies to show that higher-performing students use an LMS differently from the lower-performing students. It shows the value of combining variable- and event-centred approaches to learning analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its institutional context, its two-year time frame and by its exploratory mode of investigation to create a case study. Practical implications: The paper is useful for institutions in developing a methodology for using big data from a LMS to make use of event-centred approaches. Originality/value: The paper is valuable in replicating and extending recent studies using event-centred approaches to analysis of learning data.

Academic performance roughly expresses what a person has learned as a result of a process of instruction or training. So it is that the literature indicates different types of abuse that influence school performance. Physical and emotional abuse inflicted at home by mothers, fathers or caretakers, as well as the frequency of abuse, are associated with the academic performance of minor children. Objective. The object of this research was to determine the possible existence of abuse at public and private schools in Guatemala City, and based on this, to establish whether there was a relationship between school abuse and academic performance, controlling for certain variables that have been associated with the latter. Method. The sample was composed of a total of 500 subjects, male and female, belonging to different social strata, students from the first year of secondary education at public and private schools in different districts of Guatemala City. All subjects completed nine scales which measured current abuse at school and other variables, including certain factors that affect performance and which were taken as control variables in this research. Furthermore, all subjects completed a test of academic performance in the area of mathematics. Results and Conclusions. Results indicated that 56% of subjects who participated in this research reported having been emotionally and/or physically abused by their teachers in the month prior to application of the scale designed for this purpose. Likewise, results indicate that some variables associated with school abuse are: type of school (public, private), prevalence of bullying, and the practice of an authoritarian model of teaching/learning, as well as other variables. On the other hand, students from private schools showed better performance than their peers at public schools, without this being associated with any significantly lower abuse levels. Data analysis shows the following variables as being associated with subjects’ academic performance: self-confidence, self-esteem, school and classroom atmosphere and students’ socio-economic status. © 2017.

Furthermore it verifies the categories’ pertinence for the comprehension of schooling environment in these institutions. In a context of vulnerable territories in which these institutions are set, violence and indiscipline are considered relevant to grasp what goes on in their midst. The document basis counts seven such books in each school, produced between 2007 and 2013. A significant difference between schools springs up, both in terms of quantity of registries and in terms of categories distribution. Bearing in mind these differences and the weight of external factors on each school environment, both frequently notify events that threaten the physical and moral integrity of students, which, in the perception of those making the reports, denote unsafe environments with exposure to violence and incidence of problems relating to the mediation of conflicts and democratic bonding. In one of the schools, there is a greater emphasis on indiscipline notifications which may express, on the one hand, the attention of school professionals to events that put at risk the maintenance of authority and the fulfilment of conviviality norms in the sphere of relations between students and teachers and, on the other, the relation between students via-a-vis the established disciplinary system.

However, completion rates at this education level are far from satisfying. Attrition rates in Social Sciences doctoral programs “are known” to be high, and higher in Social Sciences and Humanities (which will be later called “Soft Sciences”) than in STEM (which will be later called “Hard Sciences”) disciplines, although there are no valid and reliable data. In order to address this problem, we carried out an investigation with two objectives: (1) to measure performance (efficiency or productivity) in 18 doctoral programs in STEM disciplines, the Social Sciences, and Humanities at various universities in Buenos Aires city and the surrounding Metropolitan Area; and (2) to design a procedure for collecting valid and reliable information that would allow us to assess doctoral programs’ performance. This measure was defined along two dimensions: completion rates (regular time rates and extra time rates) and average time-to-degree by cohort. We compiled data on individuals’ academic tracks in each cohort from their enrollment to their completion or dropout by using paper-files and digitized databases provided by academic departments. Information was analyzed by program, by cohort, and by six grouped cohorts for 2001-2006. Substantive and methodological results were found. Among the substantive results, we discovered better performance in STEM disciplines than in the Social Sciences and Humanities. As to the methodological results, postgraduate statistical registering matrix was designed and a series of recommendations are presented for use by doctoral programs and graduate programs generally. © 2016, Arizona State University.

International partnership has been an essential part of these strategies. Partnerships help institutions in creating practices that are costly, as well as enhancing reputation by partnering with prestigious schools. Moreover, different spectrums of partnerships require varying degrees of commitment. Noting that the motivation for and engagement in partnerships is particularly strong in business, and the region of Latin America as well as Asia and Oceania, this study attempts to depict how institutions engage internationalisation, revealed as the exchange network and dual degree network of the 20 best MBA programmes in the two regions. Employing social network analysis, we found that schools have different levels of engagement in building partnerships and the region and reputation of schools matter for partnerships. Top-ranked MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners and have a higher level of popularity in the exchange network. The dual degree network was more restricted in terms of the number, country, and prestige. Asian and Oceanian MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners but are less likely to engage in dual degree partnerships, compared to the Latin American MBA programmes. Some institutions focus their dual degree network on a particular region. As higher education institutions actively engage in various types of collaborations, the findings provide meaningful implications for understanding the patterns of international partnership among higher education institutions. © 2016 International Association of Universities.","Academic exchange; Dual degree; Internationalisation; Mba network; Partnership",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011031884

It should be noted that all of this postgraduate students teach classes at primary and secondary level. This is a quantitative study by applying a survey of 19 students in a graduate course. The dimensions in the survey were: impressions on the use of selected technological tools, consideration of future use, feasibility of application of technological tools, interest to incorporate its use in teaching, and prior knowledge of the technological tools. To this end, it was selected a group of five free technological tools that are viable to be used in teaching at primary and secondary level. Those tools were: Gdoc, Dropbox, Google Scholar, Blogger and Educaplay. During one course the postgraduate students learned how to use these tools in teaching, and at the end of the course the survey was applied. Data processing was by descriptive statistics using SPSS software. The study results indicate that master´s students showed a positive attitude towards the use of free technological tools. Gdocs was considered a great tool that promotes collaborative work inside and outside the classroom. Meanwhile, the least popular tool was Google Scholar, which indicates the need to encourage online academic research both teachers and students. However, the most rated tool was Educaplay due to their facility to support teaching. In relation to the previous knowledge of master´s students on selected free technological tools were scarce, although these tools have long been on the market. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","Education; Free technological tools; ICT; Mexico; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006977824

However, what is the epistemological perception of math teachers on interdisciplinary practice? We use pros and cons statements about the interdisciplinary approach written by 56 educators, and in the light of discursive textual analysis, we seek to uncover the ways which teachers understand the interdisciplinary practice. We identify simplified and rudimentary conceptions of the surveyed teachers and found that these epistemological gaps make the teachers afraid to accept interdisciplinary practice in their daily practices, either by considering that mathematics would be devalued or by feeling isolated from other areas of knowledge. This study led us to believe that the initial and continuous training of teachers, within the interdisciplinary approach would favor the acceptance of interdisciplinarity in school for these teachers.","Epistemological Conceptions; Interdisciplinarity; Teachers Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006412447

Science and biology teachers play a significant role in favoring EE at Brazilian schools. This study investigates the presence of EE in the curriculum and aims to interpret the meanings of EE expressed in the discourse of students who are training to be biology teachers at a Brazilian public university, considering recent, related education legislation. The theoretical and methodological framework of French Discourse Analysis was adopted to identify social, political, and cultural influences expressed in the students’ discourse. The discourse data comprised responses from voluntary undergraduate students to a semi-structured questionnaire. Most of the study participants claimed to have had contact with EE in their tertiary education and revealed multiple perceptions regarding this theme. The majority of the discourses indicated that EE meanings are restricted to conservation or preservation, and some indicated confusion regarding the purposes of both EE and ecology disciplines. There was little data indicating an association between EE and socioeconomic issues, which would be expected in terms of the more encompassing and interdisciplinary approaches recommended by legislation. The curricular matrix of this undergraduate course showed a predominance of hours devoted to courses that discuss the environment from the biological perspective in contrast to a small number of courses that discuss and promote EE from other perspectives. In addition, undergraduate students claimed that they had little contact with recent EE legislation. This scenario, reinforced by the naturalistic foundation discourse of EE in Brazil, probably affects the constitution of the discursive memories of these students, their discourses, and their future pedagogical practice. Recommendations are made in order to foster the development of citizenship at schools and to prevent the silencing of issues such as the conflicts and risks associated with environmental problems. © 2016 The Author (s).","Curriculum; Discourse analysis; Environmental education; Science education; Teacher training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006134384

In response to this new context, the federal government launched in 2007 a programme aiming at expansion of the enrolment to public higher education. In such environment of changes, several proposals have emerged to adapt the Brazilian federal universities to a new reality. Taking this context into account, the focus of our study is on proposals from the Mathematics Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Their aim is to create a new model of teaching practices for the freshman lessons of the Exact Sciences area, which at first were being experimented in special classrooms of students attending their first course on differential and integral calculus. The data were collected from interviews with students and professors from the mathematics department. They were analyzed and systematized using an activity theory approach. We became instigated by a model developed by Engeström in his study on the changes in the Finnish public health system, considering it as a test (testbench) for activity theory in its application to a particular case. Following Engeström's footsteps when developing his research, we arrived at our own model showing the internal tensions in the activity of reformulation of the courses offered by the Department of Mathematics and in the conceptions of teachers that promote – and constraint – the proposals for change. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Activity theory; Engeström; higher education; teaching of differential and integral calculus",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974800826

One obstacle to acceptance arises from a culture of quantitative assessment (often represented by a single mark), which is at odds with the concept of outcome assessment which is by essence subjective, qualitative and multidimensional. The method presented here is specifically concerned with learning activities where students need to demonstrate competency in learning outcomes of different natures. It describes a methodological framework that can be used in any programme that aims at developing multidimensional learners, but operates in a context where the final assessment product is a single quantitative grade. This method follows a classical approach to the evaluation of each learning outcome. It then proposes an innovative way of ranking students by categorising their overall performance based on conditions that reflect the integral nature of the learning process, to allow teaching staff to assign a range of marks for each student. Finally, a last step allows a quantitative ranking of students within each category, yielding a single quantitative mark for the course while remaining coherent with the learning goals. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","active learning; assessment grade; competency; evaluation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937790049

This is the possibility of including, within one particular course, an enormous number of participants which would be impossible even to imagine in a classroom teaching process. This is where the concept of “mass education” appears, and with it, the concept of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). These methodologies of “mass education” may seem very attractive because of the volume of students who can be trained, but are very sensitive to environmental design, which can determine the success or failure of the process.

Taking in consideration the effectiveness of the VRSS, new uses for this tool have been purposed. In sports, warming up before exercise clearly shows benefit in performance. It is hypothesized that warming up in the VRSS before going to the operating room may show benefit in surgical performance. Objective Verify whether there is benefit in surgical performance with preoperatory warm-up using a VRSS. Materials and Methods A total of 20 medical students with basic knowledge in laparoscopy were divided in 2 groups (I and II). Group I performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a porcine model. Group II performed preoperative warm-up in a VRSS and then performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a porcine model. The performance between both groups was compared regarding quantitative parameters (time for dissection of the gallbladder pedicle, time for clipping the pedicle, time for cutting the pedicle, time for gallbladder removal, total operative time, and aspirated blood loss) and qualitative parameters (depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, tissue handling, and autonomy) based on a previously validated score system, in which the higher the score, the better the result. Data were analyzed with level of significance of 5%. Results The group that underwent preoperative warm-up (group II) showed significantly superior results as to the time for dissection of the gallbladder pedicle (11.91 ± 9.85 vs. 4.52 ± 2.89 min, p = 0.012), time for clipping the pedicle (5.51 ± 2.36 vs. 2.89 ± 2.76 min, p = 0.004), time for cutting the pedicle (1.84 ± 0.7 vs. 1.13 ± 0.51, p = 0.019), aspirated blood loss (171 ± 112 vs. 57 ± 27.8 ml, p = 0.006), depth perception (4.5 ± 0.7 vs. 3.3 ± 0.67, p = 0.004), bianual dexterity (4.2 ± 0.78 vs. 3.3 ± 0.67, p = 0.004), tissue handling (4.2 ± 0.91 vs. 3.6 ± 0.66, p = 0.012), and autonomy (4.9 ± 0.31 vs. 3.6 ± 0.96, p = 0.028). There was no difference in time for gallbladder removal (11.58 ± 4.31 vs. 15.08 ± 4.51 min, p = 0.096), total operative time (30.8 ± 11.07 vs. 25.60 ± 5.10 min, p = 0.188), and efficiency (4 ± 0.66 vs. 3.6 ± 0.69, p = 0.320).

Intensity values were obtained from the digital images by measuring the RGB (red, green, blue) values (on a scale of 0-255 in intensity) of the samples between Fe(II) and o-phenanthroline using a digital camera from a smartphone. The R channel showed the best linearity for predicting the binding constant. For computational studies, iron(II) complexes using water molecules and 1,10-phenanthroline were used to evaluate the stability of the complex by varying the number of ligands. Complexes have been optimized by reaching a minimum amount of energy. It was possible to observe how stable the complexes are from the optimization calculations, including aspects about the achieved geometries. The approach provides a simple method for performing stability constants over a wide range of complexes, from the undergraduate chemistry laboratories, in the field, and in the research laboratory. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Analytical Chemistry; Computational Chemistry; First-Year Undergraduate/General; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives; Laboratory Instruction; Molecular Modeling; Physical Chemistry; UV-Vis Spectroscopy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991280602

The Burnout screening inventory (BSI), has been developed for the diagnosis of burnout. A validation of the BSI in trainees in the area of health is presented. Materials and methods A computerised questionnaire was completed by volunteers belonging to areas of health education. They scored each item on a scale where 0 equalled «never» and 6 «every day». The overall score was obtained the sum of values. Descriptive statistics were performed on each item/overall, item/item and reliability, Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The differences between subgroups were also determined. They all assumed a statistical confidence level of 95%. Results A total of 73 people completed the study, of whom 71.2% were interns.; 1.4% had moderate burnout syndrome was observed in 1.4%. Good reliability coefficients were noted in all 3 domains (> 0.6), as well as overall (0.87). The item «My situation is desperate and have no way out. Sometimes I have the feeling of being on edge» had the highest overall correlation. Items 5 vs. 7, 5 vs. 8, and 8 vs. 9 were the highest correlation item/item (> 0.6). Items of the depersonalisation domain showed the highest mean values, with no significant differences between the domains by the type of training practice. Conclusions The BSI showed to be a reliable scale to measure burnout in healthcare trainees.

Participants were encouraged to construct dynamic representations of tasks and always to look for different ways to identify and support mathematical relations. To this end, three interrelated geneses (instrumental, semiotic, discursive) proposed in the Mathematical Working Space frame are used to document ways in which the participants constructed dynamic configuration of mathematical tasks as a means initially to explore invariants and eventually formulate conjectures based on empirical arguments. Technology affordances that involve dragging objects, quantifying parameters, graphing loci and using sliders were important for the participants to articulate semiotic and discursive geneses. Thus, the participants’ approaches that appeared individual, small group and plenary discussions contributed to identifying initial conjectures that later were analyzed via empirical, geometric or algebraic arguments. In addition, the participants recognized that a working space to understand mathematical ideas and to solve problems should foster mathematical discussions beyond formal settings. The use of digital technologies plays an important role in both representing and exploring mathematical tasks and in following the discussion outside the formal class. As a result, the participants outlined a possible route to implement a route for learners to integrate activities to account for instrumental, semiotic, and discursive genesis. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Digital technologies; Empirical and formal reasoning; Mathematical Working Space; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988443676

Primarily utilized within STEM disciplines, SISA is inspired by instructivist and constructivist approaches to learning and ultimately seeks to help students reach mastery learning levels regarding complex concepts within these fields. By organizing and anchoring lesson plans concerning these concepts to the cognitive objectives outlined by Bloom's Revised Taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002), SISA facilitates students’ preparedness to contribute to the creation of technological developments and innovation in STEM fields. Offering an example of its application, this paper outlines how SISA has been integrated into the instruction of hydrodynamic velocity profiles in viscous flows. In addition, this effort highlights exploratory data collected from students taught by the SISA approach.

The random forest procedure has two main tuning parameters: the number of trees grown in the prediction and the number of predictors used. Fifty experimental conditions were created in the imputation procedure, with different combinations of predictors (from 1 to 10) and number of trees (10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000). We examined how each experimental condition affected the items fit and the difficulty of an inductive reasoning test to the dichotomous Rasch model. The results point that using random forest to impute missing values is a reliable technique to be used in psychological researches, since it led to statistically significant differences in the infit’s median only in 4% of the experimental conditions investigated, compared to the original data set result. However, researchers should be aware that in 32% of the experimental conditions, the imputation procedure significantly increased the median of the estimated items’ difficulty, compared to the original data set. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assessment; education; Imputation; machine learning; random forest; testing",,"Kementerian Sains, Teknologi dan Inovasi, MOSTI: 01-02-12-SF0028","Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Industry (MOSTI), eScienceFund Research grant 01-02-12-SF0028.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963543041

We address the endogeneity of CCT coverage by exploiting the 2008 expansion of the program to adolescents aged 16 and 17. We construct an instrument that combines the timing of expansion with the initial demographic composition of schools to identify plausibly exogenous variation in the number of children covered by Bolsa Família.

The theoretical approach for the hydrogen atom is quite straightforward, however, the level of complexity increases considerably for the dihydrogen molecule. Although, as shown in this work, it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the dihydrogen molecule variational integral by ""pen-and-paper"", this expression cannot be completely appreciated without the proper tools. In this work the ""dry"" analytical equations were implemented into an interactive platform that allows the students to visualize results (like probability densities and meaningful graphs), play with parameters, and thus gain a deeper understanding of the problem itself. Having an interactive environment is also important as a way of minimizing complex equations, testing analytical results with numerical calculations, among other things, that otherwise would be unachievable by ""pen and paper"" only. Additionally, in this work the bonding and antibonding behaviors of the dihydrogen molecule were investigated and evaluated in detail. As a final outcome, this article shows that important properties regarding the dihydrogen molecule (like equilibrium bond length and favorability of formation) can be explained and approximated with the variational method. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Atomic Properties/Structure; Computational Chemistry; Computer-Based Learning; Graduate Education/Research; Physical Chemistry; Quantum Chemistry",,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1403262, CHE-1403262; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","This project was financially supported by CAPES (Brazil), and by the National Science Foundation (United States) under grant number CHE-1403262.

Results show that the access to electronic resources has a greater impact upon performance than the number of library items borrowed. They also show that an increase in the number of sessions dedicated to accessing electronic resources was accompanied by a decrease in the number of library items borrowed as students progress in their degrees. Further analyses showed that students’ behavior is attributed more to the requirements of advanced courses (commonly encountered in later years of their degrees) than to personal preferences. This relationship between student records and library services enlightens the impact of different library resources on student learning and offers evidence to rationalize library investments according to their needs and impacts. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Electronic Resources; Learning analytics; Library; Library resources; Student performance",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1131109","This work was supported by FONDECYT grant 1131109 .",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991813338

Ohm's law was fulfilled on the applied paint, which makes it an ideal strategy to teach the relations between a resistor's length, width and resistance. The conductive paint was used in the construction of RC circuits on paper in a simple and didactic format. Using only the paint and a piece of cardboard, a completely functional parallel plate capacitor can be constructed with different plate geometries; in particular, we painted circular and rectangular plates. The charge and discharge cycles of the two RC circuits painted were observed in the oscilloscope. We obtained characteristic times and estimated the value of the dielectric constant of paper, which serves as a dielectric between the plates of the capacitors. We found conductive paint to be a useful and easy method to teach basic electricity and circuit concepts in fundamental courses and lab practices because it allows one to visualise properties such as the dependence of resistance and capacitance with geometric factors using a specific material. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984697591

To test and refine the conjecture we held semi-structured interviews with eleven students who had just completed a traditional college trigonometry course. A detailed analysis of the interviews shows that the conjecture is useful in describing student behavior in problem solving situations.

This article presents a semiotic analysis of significant fragments of classroom meaning-making which took place during the class-session in which the existence of the midpoint of a line-segment was proven. The purpose of the analysis is twofold. First follow the evolution of students’ conceptualization when constructing a geometric object that has to satisfy two conditions to guarantee its existence within the Euclidean geometric system. An object must be created satisfying one condition that should lead to the fulfillment of the other. Since the construction is not intuitive it generates a dilemma as to which condition can be validly assigned initially. Usually, the students’ spontaneous procedure is to force the conditions on a randomly chosen object. Thus, the second goal is to highlight the need for the teacher’s mediation so the students understand the strategy to prove existence theorems. In the analysis, we use a model of conceptualization and interpretation based on the Peircean triadic SIGN. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Existence proofs; Meaning-making; Students’ procedure to prove existence theorems; Teacher semiotic-mediation",,"Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS)","Our long-term project was financed by the Colombian national research institute, Colciencias, and Centro de Investigaciones, Universidad Pedagógica Nacional (CIUP).

The fact that Brazil administered the ENADE to both freshmen and senior students provided a unique opportunity to get a first approximation of the general and subject area knowledge gained in different programs. The results suggested that, on average, students in the three different categories of programs were gaining valuable general and subject area knowledge.

Developed by UNA-SUS/UFMA, Monsys was created to enable data mining in the virtual learning environment known as Moodle. Methods: This is an exploratory study using documentary and bibliographic research and analysis of the Monsys database. Two classes (2010 and 2011) were selected as research subjects, one with Monsys intervention and the other without. The samples were matched (using a ration of 1:1) by gender, age, marital status, graduation year, previous graduation status, location and profession. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression model with a 5 % significance level. Results: The findings show that the dropout rate in the class in which Monsys was not employed (2010) was 43.2 %. However, the dropout rate in the class of 2011, in which the tool was employed as a pedagogical team aid, was 30.6 %. After statistical adjustment, the Monsys monitoring system remained in correlation with the course completion variable (adjusted OR = 1.74, IC95% = 1.17-2.59; p = 0.005), suggesting that the use of the Monsys tool, isolated to the adjusted variables, can enhance the likelihood that students will complete the course. Using the chi-square test, a profile analysis of students revealed a higher completion rate among women (67.7 %) than men (52.2 %). Analysis of age demonstrated that students between 40 and 49 years dropped out the least (32.1 %) and, with regard to professional training, nurses have the lowest dropout rates (36.3 %). Conclusions: The use of Monsys significantly reduced the dropout, with results showing greater association between the variables denoting presence of the monitoring system and female gender. © 2016 The Author(s).","Distance learning; Dropout; Pedagogical support; Specialization","chi square test; data base; data mining; exploratory research; family health; female; gender; human; human experiment; learning environment; logistic regression analysis; male; marriage; model; monitoring; nurse; research subject; specialization; student; adult; education; family health; medical school; medical student; procedures; psychology; risk factor; school dropout; standards; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Education, Distance; Educational Measurement; Family Health; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Schools, Medical; Student Dropouts; Students, Medical",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983349131

Forty mother–child dyads recorded their naturalistic exchanges in their homes using an enhanced audio-recording device (the Language ENvironment Analysis System). Results from a sample of naturalistic interactions during mealtimes indicated that all mothers involved their children in a variety of math exchanges, although there were differences in the amount of math input that children received. Moreover, being exposed to more instances of math talk was positively related to children’s early mathematical ability a year after the recordings, even after we controlled for maternal education, self-regulation, and recorded minutes. Practice or Policy: These findings improve the understanding of how mothers use math with their preschool children in naturalistic contexts, providing some insight for parents into how to foster children’s math skills through verbal input in their normal routines. Moreover, these findings inform kindergarten teachers and practitioners about the math input that children receive at home, which may encourage them to adapt their practice by considering the home environment. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961391945

There are numerous reasons for that, among which are teachers’ and students’ unawareness that mathematics involves higher cognitive functions. Both the “number sense”, considered the innate start of logical-mathematical intelligence, and the “numeric core”, a cerebral cortical area located in the left parietal lobe which is responsible for processing sensory motor information, depend on an adequate stimulation to establish the bases of logical-mathematical potential development. The hands-on workshop named “Cognition and Logic” applied inclusive teaching materials adapted for visually impaired people in order to motivate and to promote sensory-motor stimulation and logical thinking through different games (tangram, Rubik′s cube, soma cube, and tower of Hanoi) at different levels of difficulty with the potential use for detection of highly talented students.

This policy-which made English instruction compulsory for all Chilean students from fifth grade-has had to deal with a series of significant challenges since its introduction. One key impediment has been the lack of qualified teachers of English at primary school level. In addition, in a crowded curriculum, English teaching has been often allocated inadequate number of hours to facilitate successful language acquisition. Further, suitable learning resources and support materials-especially designed for young learners-have often been limited. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the broader offering of English, particularly at the primary level, has had an important democratising effect. It has been somewhat effective in allowing children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to access a global language and a potential world of opportunities previously only available to students attending wealthy private institutions. Data suggests that this policy has had some impact in establishing educational foundations for broader access to more advanced language learning for all students in Chile. However, equally it demonstrates further resources and support for teachers and teaching is essential to realise this potential. © 2016, Arizona State University.

Foreign language teaching as an obligatory school subject appears only in the sixth year of basic education, and its goal is more connected to the development of critical citizens, rather than to the promotion of proficient speakers of the language. Recently, however, a number of municipal public educational systems, often in partnership with private language institutes, have introduced ELT from the very first year of primary school. This is the case, for example, of the project Rio Global Child 2016, created by the City of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Cultura Inglesa, a well-known private English institute in Brazil. What I intend to do in this paper, thus, is: firstly, to present an historical overview of ELT in Brazilian public schools, discussing its educational relevance and functions, the challenges faced by teachers and students, and both the beliefs and debates concerning the issue (cf. Almeida, 2012; Assis-Peterson, 2003; Moita Lopes, 1996; Tílio, 2012) - including also a first account of the Brazilian cities involved in the implementation of ELT in primary schools; and, then, to discuss critically Rio de Janeiro’s project for the teaching of English in primary schools. Such a discussion is necessary not only because it may help to understand better the risks of adopting a single method (and its materials) for teaching in contexts that can be extremely different from one another, but also because other projects and experiences may benefit from an honest account of the problems faced by the association of private and public spheres and interests exemplified by Rio’s project. © 2016, Arizona State University.

To conduct the survey we have used internet search engines with keywords related to mathematics education and digital technology and have reviewed some of the main international journals, including the ones in Portuguese and Spanish. We identify five sub-areas of research, important trends of development, and illustrate them using case studies: mobile technologies, massive open online courses (MOOCs), digital libraries and designing learning objects, collaborative learning using digital technology, and teacher training using blended learning. These examples of case studies may help the reader to understand how recent developments in this area of research have evolved in the last few years. We conclude the report discussing some of the implications that these digital technologies may have for mathematics education research and practice as well as making some recommendations for future research in this area. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Digital libraries; Internet; Learning objects; Mobile learning; MOOC",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978114994

To approach the question of how research can support practice to assist these students one has to clarify the group or groups of students that we are talking about. The following contribution firstly concentrates on the problem of labelling the group of students having mathematical difficulties as there does not exist a single definition. This problem might be put down to the different roots of mathematics education on the one hand and special education on the other hand. Research results with respect to concepts and models for instruction are multifaceted based on the specific content and mathematical topics as well as the underlying view of mathematics. Taking into account inclusive education, a closer orientation to mathematical education can be identified and the potential of selected teaching and learning concepts can be illustrated. Beyond this, the role of the teacher, their attitudes and beliefs and the corresponding teacher education programs are discussed. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Inclusive education; Mathematical learning difficulties; Special education; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978035360

It takes as a starting point a previous survey, commissioned for ICME 10 in 2004 that focused on Mathematics Teacher Education. The current survey focuses centrally on teachers involved in collaborations, sometimes in formal settings of professional development, but also in a more diverse range of collaborative settings including research initiatives. The roles of teachers involved in the collaboration, survey methods, decisions and limitations are described. While some of the findings to date resonate with those of the earlier survey, other findings highlight characteristics and issues relating to the differing ways in which teachers collaborate, either with other teachers or the various ‘others’, most notably mathematics teacher educator researchers. The roles and relationships that contribute to learning in such collaborations, as well as theories and methodologies found in survey sources, are a focus of the findings presented here. Studies rarely theorised collaboration, and few of those that did so reported explicitly on how their theoretical frame shaped the design of research methodologies/approaches guiding activities with teachers. One significant outcome has been the difficulty of relating teachers’ learning to collaboration within a project, although many initiatives report developments in teaching, teacher learning and students’ learning. © 2016, The Author(s).","Community of inquiry; Community of practice; Lesson study; Mathematics teaching; Mathematics teaching development; Teacher collaboration; Teacher learning; Teacher professional development",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 26245082; Norges Forskningsråd; University of Tsukuba","We should like to express sincere thanks to Masami Isoda and the University of Tsukuba for funding two survey team meetings in Tokyo in 2015 and 2016 with JSPS grant No. 26245082.

LCM involved an inquiry-based approach to developing mathematics learning and teaching within the schools and furthering knowledge about the developmental process. Theory of inquiry and community of inquiry (Cochrane-Smith and Lytle ; Jaworski ; Wells ) underpinned the project.

This conviction obstructs the use of this knowledge in the classroom. Starting from these conjectures, we planned a training course, on ethnomathematics, for primary school teachers in Colombia. The course was taken as an investigative case through a qualitative methodology for case studies. The records produced from a group interview and researcher's field diary were analyzed under the Wittgenstein's philosophy view. We concluded that the conjectures are not met, since there is no complete consistency between the epistemological concepts and action in the classroom.

From the background and the stated examples, it can be seen that these tools have potential for the diagnosis and treatment of many kinds of errors associated with mathematical practices. Semiotic functions allow: visualization of the level of complexity of a particular mathematical practice; accurately assessment of the student mathematical practice for meaning discrepancies, and promotion of the redesign of teaching sequences, bearing in mind the complexities and conflicts detected. It is also outlined the steps of successive refinements for defining appropriate semiotic functions for the analysis of a particular problem. Thus, a systematization of this process is shown, which enables its application in other researches related to the study of meanings.","Meaning; Methodological tool; Ontosemiotic Approach; Semiotic functions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970965452

There is concern that residents are at risk of receiving inadequate training due to the low number of operations they perform. In Brazil, although all GS residents receive by law the Board Certification at the end of their programs, the assessment of their technical skills is not mandatory in Medical Residency programs’ training. Consequently, our concern was that current GS medical residency format might be insufficient to create competent and autonomous general surgery residents after 2 years of regular training. Hence, the aim was to assess GS residents’ surgical skills in their final months of training to evaluate the present format of GS residency programs in Brazil. Approach: Trained surgical faculty members directly observed 11 operations of varying difficulty performed by 2nd-year regular GS residents and by 4th-year residents in the optional Advanced Program in General Surgery. Participants were located at 3 university and 3 nonuniversity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Brazil's largest cities). Surgical skills were assessed using an internally developed observation checklist reviewed by subject matter experts. Findings: Sixty residents (46 regular 2nd-year trainees and 14 advanced 4th-year trainees) were assessed on performing 499 operations. Only 10 residents (17%), all advanced 4th-year residents, satisfactorily performed all operations and were considered eligible for the Board Certification. Even after excluding the 2 operations of greatest difficulty, only 24 regular 2nd-year residents (52%) satisfactorily performed the other 9 operations. Residents from hospitals with open Emergency Departments performed better than those from hospitals without Emergency Departments. Insights: The results of this pilot study suggest that residents with 2 years of training are not prepared for independent high-level surgical practice. The current formatting of regular GS residency programs in Brazil (2 years) may be insufficient to train experts in general surgery. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","general surgery; residency; technical skills assessment; training","Brazil; certification; checklist; city; emergency ward; general surgery; human; human experiment; pilot study; resident; skill; student; surgery; university; clinical competence; clinical trial; curriculum; education; female; general surgery; male; medical education; multicenter study; procedures; Brazil; Certification; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Pilot Projects",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964018588

In this paper, the authors aim at evaluating if the gestures of an animated pedagogical agent to explain hints related to equation solving improves the students' understanding of these help messages. With this goal, they developed an animated pedagogical agent that uses gestures coupled with messages to explain hints in an algebra tutor. The authors performed a qualitative pilot study with four students to verify the impact of using gestures by the animated pedagogical agent on the comprehension of the hints, using two different versions of the system. The difference between these versions was the availability of gestures by the agent. The results showed that students understood the hints provided by the agent more correctly when they were coupled with agent's gesture. Furthermore, they also preferred using the tutor version with gestures.

We use APOS theory and propose a genetic decomposition that separates it into two statements: the first one for sets and the second with added structure. We administered a questionnaire to students from top Chilean universities and selected some of these students for interviews to gather information about the viability of our genetic decomposition. The students interviewed were divided in two groups based on their familiarity with equivalence relations and partitions. Students who were able to draw on their intuition of partitions were able to reconstruct the group theorem from the set theorem, while those who stayed on the purely algebraic side could not. Since our approach to learning this theorem was successful, it may be worthwhile to gather data while teaching it the way we propose here in order to check how much the learning of the group isomorphism theorem is improved. This approach could be expanded to other group homomorphism theorems provided further analysis is conducted: going from the general (e.g., sets) to the particular (e.g., groups) might not always the best strategy, but in some cases we may just be turning to more familiar settings. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.","APOS theory; Equivalence relation; Genetic decomposition; Group isomorphism theorem",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958770239

Here, I present a third theory in terms of an intentionality interpretation of meaning, which provides an alternative departure for the discussion of meaning in mathematics education. The importance of intentionality for understanding human phenomena was emphasised by both Brentano and Husserl. They associated intentionality with a pure stream of consciousness, which constitutes an a priori to any human experience. I agree that the notion of intentionality is important; however, I find it crucial to provide a paradigmatic uprooting of this notion and to consider it as being structured by economic, political, cultural, and discursive factors. Such real-life intentionalities constitute the basis for an intentionality interpretation of meaning. I explore this interpretation with respect to mathematics education by addressing imaginations, possibilities, obstructions, hopes, fears, stereotypes and preconceptions. I relate meaning in mathematics education to far away horizons of students’ life worlds, to negotiations, to political issues, to diversity and to instrumentalism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Intentionalities; Intentionality interpretation of meaning; Meaning in mathematics education; Politics of meaning; Real-life intentionalities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944544229

Studies have shown that poverty affects the development of the brain in ways that might compromise future learning, thus increasing the differences between groups with different SES. Interest is growing in the development of tools that might change this state of affairs. This article presents a tablet-based study aimed at determining the cognitive abilities related to primary school children’s math learning. The study followed the students’ changes during a short intervention, the purpose of which was to improve students’ performance of some of the core components of mathematical cognition; in particular, of the approximate number system (ANS), a system that supports one’s ability to estimate quantities and to compare time intervals. The article presents the study’s characteristics and shows how the variables that were evaluated—ANS precision, time discrimination accuracy, digit span, and mathematical achievement—depend on SES. We employ multiple regressions to show that the variance in mathematics performance attributed to SES can be explained by differences in underlying cognitive factors. The study also indicates that those students of low-SES schools who participated in more tablet activities increased their performance more than students who did fewer activities. Although the intervention’s initial objective was to influence mathematical development and the study is not a randomized double-blind study, we argue that training the ANS can have positive effects in mathematics learning, and that this might benefit children living in low-SES contexts more than those in the general population, perhaps because of the former’s initially low levels of performance in school mathematics. © 2017, UNESCO IBE.","Cognitive abilities; Math learning; Socio-economic status (SES); Uruguay",,,"This work was supported by Centro Ceibal para el Apoyo a la Educación de la Niñez y la Adolescencia, Uruguay.

The design of the teaching experiment articulates the static perspective of exponential covariation and a reformulation for the discrete case of the dynamic perspective of the covariation. The static perspective considers that amounts of one quantity varying in arithmetic progression are associated or juxtaposed with amounts of another quantity varying in geometric progression. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective coordinates two varying quantities while attending the ways in which they change in relation to each other. The conceptual framework also takes into account the results of previous epistemological-historical studies about the development of the concepts of exponential and logarithmic functions. The data analysis aims to define the logarithmic-exponential covariational reasoning of the participants through the identification of the mental actions and levels of reasoning achieved during the teaching experiment. The results show that the teaching experiment contributed to the students' perception of the changes in the involved variables and to infer the juxtaposition of the operations: ""multiplying by adding"" and ""divide by subtracting"".

The results of this analysis show that top contributors have better final scores than the rest. In addition, there is a moderate positive correlation between participants' overall performance (measured in terms of final scores) and the number of posts submitted to the five social tools. This article also studies the effect of participants' gender and scores as factors that can be used for the early detection of top contributors. The analysis shows that gender is not a good predictor and that taking the scores of the first assessment activities of each type (test and peer assessment in the case study) results in a prediction that is not substantially improved by adding subsequent activities. Finally, better predictions based on scores are obtained for aggregate contributions in the five social tools than for individual contributions in each social tool. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Contributions; Learning analytics; MOOC; Performance; Social tools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959491931

The objective of this research was to analyze students’ use of strategies associated to number sense and compare them with those obtained in a previous study with pre-service primary teachers in Taiwan, (Yang, Reys & Reys, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 7, 383–403, 2009). Pre-service secondary teachers showed lower success than pre-service primary teachers in a number sense test. Nevertheless, these last based their reasoning mainly on rules and algorithms, while pre-service secondary teachers used more strategies of number sense. In an attempt to delve into the low success shown by of Spanish pre-service secondary teachers, some students were interviewed. Those interviews showed that a deeper work on number sense in the training of these students is needed. © 2015, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","Degree in mathematics; Number sense; Pre-service primary teachers; Pre-service secondary teachers; Strategies",,"BF0003; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT","This research is supported by the project EDU2011-29324: Modelos de competencia formal y cognitiva en pensamineto numérico y algebraico de alumnos de Primaria, de Secundaria y de profesorado de Primaria en formación.

The genetic decomposition which was proposed can contribute to help students achieve an understanding of quadratic equations with improved interrelation of ideas and more flexible application of solution methods. Semi-structured interviews with eight beginning undergraduate students explored which of the mental constructions conjectured in the genetic decomposition students could do, and which they had difficulty doing. Two of the mental constructions that form part of the genetic decomposition are highlighted and corresponding further data were obtained from the written work of 121 undergraduate science and engineering students taking a multivariable calculus course.

As a consequence, these countries now have school networks that consist of many small schools, leading many countries to consider reorganizing their networks by closing smaller schools and reallocating students. Using a rich data-set of almost the entire population of Ukrainian secondary schools, we estimate the effect of school size and class size on the performance of secondary schools on Ukraine's External Independent Test. We find that larger schools tend to have somewhat better performance, both in terms of test scores and in terms of test participation. The size of this effect is relatively small, however, especially in rural areas for which the estimates are likely to be less biased. Class size is found to be insignificant in most specifications and, if significant, of negligible size. The importance of this finding for the ‘rationalization’ of the large school networks in Eastern Europe is discussed. © 2015 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.

This article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology teachers’ understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training. Teachers’ views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews, and in the second session we collected information about teachers’ perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers’ understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated NOS.

The development of this syndrome may be influenced by previous characteristics of the student. Objective: To describe the relationship between levels of burnout of dental students and their socio-demographic characteristics and academic background. Methods: A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory for Students was applied to a total sample of 276 students from different educational levels of the career of Dentistry at the University of Concepción. The sample was obtained by non-probability quota sampling. From university data base, the information on the academic background of the participants was obtained. Results: When comparing the levels of burnout of men and women and its relation to the educational level, we observed significant differences in the level of Emotional exhaustion. In relation to gender, women had higher scores than men (p< 0.001). As for the educational level, we found differences between first and second year, and between first and third year, where first year students showed lower levels of Emotional exhaustion (p <0.01). When evaluating the correlation of burnout levels with the academic background, we found a statistically significant correlation between Emotional exhaustion and school average grades. Conclusions: There is a relationship between gender, level of education and academic background of the Dentistry students at the University of Concepción and their burnout levels. © 2016, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

Rio de Janeiro was the administrative center of the republic, so there was a need for coordinating government policy on education and health, especially in that city. This study has aimed to evaluate the influence and impact of hygienist strategies on the daily life of schools. Its sources were mainly O Paiz and Jornal do Brazil newspapers in the 1930s. The document corpus consisted of 37 newspaper articles, of which 21 were analyzed in this research, because they involved the following specific categories: school medicine, school hygiene and health education. The hypothesis pointed to the limited influence of intellectuals, with a gap between what was thought and what was executed. However, findings allow us to consider approaching the educational discourses and practices influenced by the actual participation of intellectuals such as Fernando de Azevedo and Anísio Teixeira in the organization of education in Rio de Janeiro, particularly in the early 1930s.","Body education; History of education; Hygiene; Public health",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976509446

Research included 120 students from the Education degree course at Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS), both in an intermediate or senior stage. Students were asked to answer a self-applicable questionnaire that inquired about their representations about being a teacher, how they evaluated the choice for that specific degree and their interest in the teaching profession. Data was statistically treated and contents were analyzed according to Bardin (2010). The main results include that students gave high importance to teachers for society but they acknowledge that the profession is not socially valued, a factor that emerged as one of the major reasons for dissatisfaction at the choice of the Education degree. Even though a significant number of respondents (79.8 percent) mentioned their intention of being a classroom teacher, most of them did not show interest in a long-term (over 10 years' time) dedication to this activity. Results allowed to consider that, although the positive image of teacher's social role contributes to add interest in or admiration for the profession, this sole aspect seems insufficient to motivate the permanence of students in such career, pointing to the need for changes in the working conditions and in the context of social devaluation of the teaching profession, aspects perceived as negative by these students.","Interest in teaching; Social representation of teacher; Teaching profession",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976506619

The presentation is based on several studies carried out in the student residence at Universidad de Cienfuegos, in the Center-South of Cuba. They have combined quantitative and qualitative analysis, considering social, demographic variables and indexes related to satisfaction with access to culture, health, social life mediated by social class and sociocultural structure, which distinguishes specificities in the cultural biography of individuals and groups. Importance was attributed to the meanings given to the residence as a relevant space for educational life, the perceptions of the multiple and diverse relationships between the groups in it, as well as the levels of dialogues in the academic, scientific, and social fields. Several documents were analysed, and observations, questionnaires and depth interviews were conducted. From this context, the implications of the theoretical deficit in the educational management of the university residence have emerged. Such deficit limits the educational project in terms of curriculum development aimed at a more coherent socialization process. It is concluded that the lack of theoretical perspectives in higher education led the political view to occupy the first interpretation of the process, expressed in solidarity actions, and even when concrete and important results in the number of graduates are evidenced, the formative process was limited in terms of deep dialogue, cultural socialization to achieve unity among diversity.","Cuba; Interculturality; Multiculturality; Student residence; University",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976482230

The group of 23 observed students was composed exclusively of students from sixth, seventh and eighth period. The research sought to identify possible conceptual problems of the students, their abilities to identify the level of difficulty of the problem; also, it was examined the extent that undergraduates dominate mathematical calculus as a tool for troubleshooting. It was presented to the students a problem taken from a federal university college entrance test. Due to an error in the preparation, this problem can only be solved with higher education mathematical tools. Students also answered a semi-structured questionnaire that identified their perceptions about the problem. Based on the analysis of the written collected material, we see that only two students were successful in the task, and more than half of them failed to interpret the problem conceptually. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Conceptual problems; Mathematics education; Physics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964771107

The work is centered on the way students address their deficiencies in the mathematical prerequisites of new knowledge of the Laplace transform. The study, based on the theory of mathematics in the context of science, compares students in electronic engineering (control and experimental groups). The results indicate that the use of software in deficient prerequisites improves operational skills in solving events of the Laplace transform. Students can better understand the concepts when there is precision in calculations as well as graphs, and they have fewer detractors when concentrating on the concepts they must construct.","Computer science; Engineering; Higher education; Mathematics teaching; Mexico",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964715580

Our working hypothesis is that the solely representation of the product of two natural numbers by the area of a rectangle can hinder the vision of the product of two integers. Referring us to the scheme of Mathematical Working Spaces, we need another representation for the semiotic genesis of the integers. We tested didactical resources coming out from a geometrical construction made by Descartes in his geometric supplement of the Discourse on the Method, but we observed that this geometric introduction of the product can also produce difficulties, because it does not easily illustrate the distributive law. We may explain this phenomenon considering the product of numbers as a procept. Thus, the homothetic transformations of the Cartesian plane constitute a convenient geometrical resource that we may propose for teaching of the integers and, more generally, the numbers with a sign.","2D geometry; Dilation; Distributive law; Mathematical working spaces; Multiplication of numbers; Semiotic genesis; Signs rule",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964456693

This article evaluates the implementation of the BHCK intervention in recreation centers, and describes lessons learned. Sixteen youth leaders delivered bi-weekly, interactive sessions to 10- to 14-y olds. Dose, fidelity and reach are assessed, as is qualitative information regarding what worked well during sessions. Dose is operationalized as the number of interactive sessions, and taste tests, giveaways and handouts per session; fidelity as the number of youth leaders participating in the entire intervention and per session and reach as the number of interactions with the target population. Based on a priori set values, number of interactive sessions was high, and number of taste tests, giveaways and handouts was moderate to high (dose). The number of participating youth leaders was also high (fidelity). Of the 14 planned sessions, the intervention was implemented with high/moderate reach. Data suggest that working with cross-age peers is a promising nutritional intervention for recreation centers. © The Author 2016.

For this purpose, the children's behavior was analyzed while teachers provided feedback during collaborative learning sessions. Method: A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional study included two experimental groups and a control group. The age of participants ranged from 4.8 to 5.3 years old; all of them regularly attended a school located in La Pintana, Santiago, Chile. Their educators were trained in delivery of either self-regulation feedback or task/person feedback. While students performed collaborative work related to the Chilean curriculum, educators provided the different types of feedback. A total of 18 learning experiences were videotaped and analyzed using Videograph and SPSS software. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between the groups of children that received feedback. A greater number of metacognitive control events were displayed by preschoolers who received self-regulation feedback: in total number of events and in number of events representing each of the three dimensions of metacognitive control (planning, monitoring and evaluation). Discussion and conclusions: Not all feedback modifies the metacognitive control of preschoolers. Low-cost training in self-regulation feedback and its daily practice equip the preschool teacher to be a key facilitator of children's cognitive development. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Metacognitive control; Preschool teaching; Self-regulation; Teacher feedback",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963593629

The assumption is that the model will work as long as schools provide families with public, pertinent, and timely information. When the right to choose freely cannot be exercised, school effectiveness can be regulated through parent participation in school activities. The main objective of this study was to estimate the effects of household socioeconomic status and type of information provided by the school on parent participation in school activities. A cross-sectional, quantitative, non-experimental study of the association of information and parent participation with household socioeconomic status was conducted using least squares regression analysis (OLS) and binary logistic regression models. The study is based on data from a subsample of 258 people who reported having at least one child enrolled in high school. We used data from the Metropolitan Family and Education Survey developed by the Centro de Estudio e Investigación sobre Familia (CEIF). The results show that parents are more willing to participate in activities related to everyday aspects of their children’s school experience. OLS models reveal some elements that positively influence parent participation: accountability (.24), personal student information (.42), and high socioeconomic status (2.49). Our conclusion is that the provision of personal student information, along with the accountability of institutional management, can increase the relative probability of a more active participation of families in functional classroom activities. © 2016, SECRETARÍA GENERAL TÉCNICA.","Accountability; Parent participation; School Effectiveness",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962703753

Methods: An online survey was carried out during the period July-December 2013. Forty-one representatives of early career psychiatrists of their national associations were invited to participate. Each respondent was asked to provide the collective feedback of the association rather than that of any of its individual officer or member. Results: Thirty-two associations returned the questionnaire out of the 41 contacted (response rate, 78 %). All respondents recognized psychopathology as a core component of training in psychiatry. According to respondents, the primary aims of psychopathology are (a) to assess psychiatric symptoms (47 %), (b) to understand patients' abnormal experiences (33 %), and (c) to make nosographical diagnosis (20 %). A formal training course in psychopathology is available in 29 out of the 32 surveyed countries. In most countries, (a) there is not a defined number of hours dedicated to psychopathology, (b) teaching is mainly theoretical, and (c) a structured training on psychometric tools is missing. At the end of the training, about half of trainees is not satisfied with received training in psychopathology. Conclusions: According to European early career psychiatrists, there is the need to rethink training in psychopathology, which should be at the heart of training in psychiatry and the key element of psychiatric practice. Education in psychopathology is affected by several unmet needs, such as lack of appropriate training in the use of psychometric instruments, lack of supervision, and lack of practical skills. © 2015 Academic Psychiatry.","Career development; Medical education; Professional development; Psychopathology; Training","curriculum; education; Europe; health personnel attitude; Internet; medical education; mental disease; psychiatry; questionnaire; Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Europe; Internet; Psychiatry; Psychopathology; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959353731

The financial aid policy for students in Chile has undergone major changes over the last decade, which has allowed individuals from usually underrepresented income groups to enroll in higher education institutions. This analysis combines information from four public administrative agencies, obtaining a sample of over 75 % of all high school graduates for the period 2007–2010. Methods include descriptive statistics, logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Both continuous persistence and reentry were studied at the system and at the institutional level for all four cohorts. Descriptive results show that short- and long-term dropout rates at the system level are high, and dropout rates are even higher at the level of institutions. Findings from the PSM show that the non-subsidized state loan is the instrument that displays the strongest correlation with persistence and it holds homogeneously across students from different socioeconomic groups. Among grants, we find consistently positive effects of need-based grants targeting low-income students attending technical institutions. We provide educational policy recommendations based on our findings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Dropout; Education policy; Financial aid; Persistence",,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: F611103; Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM","The primary national grants for tuition and fees are the Bicentenario fellowship, the Juan Gomez Millas grant, the Academic Excellence grant and the New Millenium grant. These grants differ substantially in the amount of benefit provided and on the type of students they benefit since eligibility requirements include the type of postsecondary institution in which a student enrolls (Financial Aid Committee Report ). For example, the Bicentenario fellowship is available only to students who enroll in CRUCH universities and the New Millenium grant only funds students who enroll in IPs and CFTs. Two primary public loans are also available, and both target students in the first four income quintiles. The Fondo Solidario Universitario loan (CFS) is accessible only to students enrolled at CRUCH institutions, while the Crédito con Aval del Estado loan (CAE) has been available to all students, regardless of the type of institution they enroll in, since 2006. The CFS is administered by each institution and charges a 2 % interest rate, and repayment is contingent on students’ income. The CAE, in contrast, is administered centrally by a special Loan Administration Office, called Comisión Ingresa, is provided by the private financial system, until 2012, and charged a 6 % interest rate, and students repaid through monthly installments of a fixed amount. In 2012, the CAE interest rate decreased and became the same as the one charged by the CFS. Also in 2012, the CAE repayment process was modified in order to tie monthly installments to actual income. In sum, then, the Chilean higher education and financial aid system reflect a complex set of enterprises and peculiarities important to consider when going over the results of the study.","Currently, financial aid is available to Chilean students through a variety of institution- and nationally funded grants and loans. Most national financial aid resources require some sort of merit (e.g., admission test performance, high school grades or ranking) and demonstrated need as eligibility determinants (Horn et al. ). There are also a few scholarships awarded based on specific requirements, such as the Grant for Teacher Training Programs and the Grant for children of Teaching Professionals. In general, grants and loans only cover tuition up to the reference tuition defined by the Ministry of Education. The application process for nationally funded financial aid is centralized and administered by the Ministry of Education. Students must complete one application form and undergo socioeconomic accreditation. The allocation of grants and loans, however, is not integrated, and although none of benefits can go over the reference tuition amount, total benefits may end up surpassing the reference tuition amount (Financial Aid Committee Report ). In 2012, about 40 % of the students enrolled in higher education in 2012 had some sort of financial aid, with 20 % having some type of grant. On average, equity grants fund about 50 % of the mean real tuition students face (Intelis and Verde ).","This research was partially funded by the Ministry of Education of Chile through Project FONIDE No: F611103 and by Anillo Project SOC 1107 Statistics for Public Policy in Education from the Chilean Government.",,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930793686

Firstly, we consider the racial self-declaration as a criterion to decide access to the quota; secondly, the technical difficulties and the possibility of competition inter and intragroup; thirdly, the difference between the percentages of blacks, pardos, indigenes (PPI) and low income students in general population, and the percentages of blacks, pardos, indigenes (PPI) and low income students in the socioeconomic strata used by quota law to define the reserved spots. The criteria for reserved spot distribution comprehend not only the obligation of study all the high school in a public institution, but also devices for calculus of the groups with access with reserved spots, according to four classifications: I-a: students from public middle schools, with per capita family income equal or less than 1,5 minimum wage, and PPI; I-b: students from public middle schools with per capita family income equal to or less than 1,5 minimum wage, no PPI; and II-a: students from public middle schools with per capita family income above 1,5 minimum wage, PPI; II-b: students from public middle schools with per capita family income above 1,5 minimum wage, no PPI. Metodologically, we analyzed documents related to the quota law process, and comparative quantitative analisys of the educational and demographical census is made. We conclude that despite its importance as a landmark to affirmative actions in higher education, quota law doesn’t have the necessary conditions to guarantee a fair distribution of the reserved spots. © 2016, Education Policy Analysis Archives.

The research was carried out based on an eight-question questionnaire about evolution acceptance and understanding. The instrument included seven Likert-scale questions and one open-ended question. An analysis of the data revealed that more than 70% of teachers (pre-service and in-service) and undergraduate students recognised the theory of evolution as established scientific knowledge. When participants discussed the mechanism of evolution in the open-ended question, the most prevalent responses from students and teachers (33%) explained evolution as need-driven changes for survival purposes. Only 13% of the responses could be considered Darwinian, and 10% of responses included more than one view of evolution. The Darwinian responses generally included three important aspects: variation, inheritance and differential reproduction.

Among them, the quaternions are a very popular choice and with a strong practical appeal on the parameterization and integration of the Euler’s equations. In this sense, this paper proposes a comparison between the numerical integration of the Euler equations of a gyroscope with the inverse kinematics solved through Euler angles and by quaternions, that are not commonly described in classical mechanics textbooks on a first mechanical course. The goal is to show that apart the numerical asset, the integration of the motion equations with the quaternions parameterization also can be used with a noblest didactical way: to introduce and motivate the students with the use of others more advanced algebraic systems, as Geometric Algebra (Clifford’s Algebra). © 2016.

This paper analyzes the arithmetic problems posed by a group of mathematically talented students when given two problem-posing tasks, and compares these students’ responses to those given by a standard group of public school students to the same tasks. Our analysis focuses on characterizing and identifying the differences between the productions of both groups, based on an analytic framework designed in this study. Method. The sample is composed of two groups of students. The first consists of 21 students identified as mathematically talented and the second of 20 secondary students in a public school. Both groups completed two tasks of posing arithmetic problems designed in this study. The results were analyzed based on three categories of analysis and variables related to the problems’ syntactic, semantic, and mathematical structure. Results. The problems posed by the group of mathematically talented students are richer than those of the group of public school students. The talented students’ problems are composed of a greater number of propositions, use different types of numbers, require more steps and different calculation processes to solve, and have a higher number of different semantic relationships. Furthermore, the results show some attributes that enable us to characterize mathematically talented students when solving problemposing tasks. Conclusion. The problem-posing instrument and the analytical diagram enabled description and exploration of the performance of a group of mathematically talented students. Moreover, the three categories of analysis used and the solvability of each problem produced ten components whose values characterize the wealth of problems that the subjects invented. Finally, statistical analysis reinforces the differences between the productions of the two study groups. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain)","arithmetic problems; Mathematical talent; Mathematics Education; problem posing; richness of statements",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121560910

In addition, information and communication technologies have been gradually included within the process of teaching mathematics. Such adoption of technology modified the educational process, thus generating a meaningful impact as presented by studies carried out by Galbraith and Haines (2000). They developed a theoretical model aiming to explain this phenomenon from the component elements of attitude toward mathematics and computers: Mathematics engagement, mathematics confidence, mathematics motivation, computer confidence, and student's interaction with mathematics and computer. The purpose of this study was validating that model against experimental data coming from a sample of undergraduates from the fields of administration and economics. The collected data was processed applying multivariate data analysis using structural equation modeling technique. The observed fit indices corroborated that the theoretical model adjusts statistically well to the empirical data, even though the observed variance stayed below the optimal value. The evidence obtained in this study validates the theoretical model while revealing that additional weightings for the indicators should still be explored. © 2016, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

We choose fireworks as a macroscopic event to teach basic chemical principles related to the Bohr atomic model and matter-energy interaction. During teachers' Cmap navigation, students can experience a sense of disorientation, which is detrimental to the learning process. Two graphical cues were tested as Cmap navigation guidance: (1) colour-coded concepts, to group similar content and (2) numbered propositions to offer a reading sequence. A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design combined with mental effort was utilized to measure the efficiency of Cmaps in learning. First-year undergraduate students (n = 85) were randomly assigned to study one of four possible Cmaps. The results showed that all students were able to increase their level of factual knowledge, despite the Cmap being used as an instructional material.

Consideramos que este tipo de retroalimentación no produce cambios en los profesores. En nuestro modelo MED, la retroalimentación se hace en el seminario a través del análisis de un episodio de clase en que mediante la problematización y la gestión del formador, se promueve que el profesor reconozca los elementos de su práctica, elicitando así sus ideas (opiniones, decisiones, etc.) y luego contrastándolas con la evidencia. El hecho que ese análisis sea grupal permite que por lo general la evaluación de la clase realizada previamente por el formador, sea similar a la obtenida por el grupo de profesores en el seminario. Con ello hemos evidenciado que el docente realmente se apropia de las acciones que dieron resultado y toma conciencia de las acciones que no contribuyen a gestionar la clase según el propósito establecido.","Las experiencias de formación continua que hemos desarrollado por medio del MED han mostrado que los docentes se apropian del Conocimiento Pedagógico del Contenido (CPC): desarrollo de las competencias matemáticas, la incorporación del álgebra temprana (Early algebra) en los primeros niveles del básica, la argumentación en el aula de matemática, entre otros. En el primer proyecto, del que emergió el MED, obtuvimos como conclusión que los cambios en el profesor no solo requieren de un CPC acorde a las necesidades del docente sino una metodología para que el docente se apropie de dicho CPC (Solar et al., 2012). Actualmente, consideramos que el valor del modelo de formación es crucial en los proceso de cambio. Es habitual pensar que la efectividad de un modelo de formación de profesores pasa más por los CPC en juego que por la forma de trabajar con los profesores. Nosotros consideramos que los temas pueden variar en función de las necesidades del profesor o sistema. Más aún, el modelo MED puede ser aplicado después de un diagnós-tico al establecimiento educacional y, a partir de los resultados, decidir cuáles pueden ser los temas de formación pertinente. En esta misma lógica, incluso no sería necesario tener un CPC predominante en el proceso de formación, sino que pueden ser temas puntuales como, por ejemplo, la gestión del error o la elicitación de ideas de los estudiantes, en que se pueden utilizar videos de otros profesores en que se vean estas prácticas para que luego los mismos docentes se aproximen a dichas gestiones de clases con intervenciones puntuales donde discutan sus experiencias para luego planificar y evaluar.",,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028653107

In Brazil, such prescriptions are legally regulated and restricted to primary health care protocols. The presence of prescribing nurses has provoked a debate among medical and nursing corporations. However, there are few studies examining the qualifications, protocols and in-service training that are aimed at prescribing nurses in primary health care. Objective: We sought to investigate possible gaps between the education, qualifications, self-assessments and practice of prescribing medicine in primary health care from the perspective of nurses. Design: This investigation is a case study with a qualitative approach. Setting: This research was conducted in a Brazilian municipality with 84.04% family health strategy coverage and 400,002 inhabitants in northeast Brazil. Participants: The participants were an intentional sample of 37 nurses in primary health care who were linked to the family health strategy. Methods: The study was conducted between August and November 2011 with four focus groups, a script validated by the Delphi technique, and a pilot study. This study addressed the qualifications for the prescription of medication, the sufficiency of the Ministry of Health protocols and self-assessments of the ability to prescribe. Qualitative analysis was applied. Results: All nurses reported having received insufficient training in the discipline of pharmacology to qualify them for prescriptive practice. The nurses emphasised the need for post-graduate training, the importance of clinical experience, and the lack of discussions and training. Only a small number of nurses self-assessed themselves as competent in prescribing drugs, and the others revealed fears of causing adverse reactions to medication. Conclusions: There are gaps in the education, training, and daily demands of the prescription of medication by nurses in primary health care. It is suggested that prescription practices should be incorporated into undergraduate studies and continuing education in health services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Nursing; Prescription of medication; Primary health care; Qualification","Brazil; in service training; nursing staff; organization and management; prescription; Brazil; Drug Prescriptions; Inservice Training; Nursing Staff",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028244583

We hypothesized that participation in the Project SEMILLA resuscitation program would significantly improve the physician's management of simulated code scenarios.METHODS: Thirteen Nicaraguan resident physicians were evaluated while managing simulated cardiac arrest scenarios before, immediately, and at 6 months after participating in the Project SEMILLA resuscitation program. This project was completed in 2014 in Leon, Nicaragua. The Cardiac Arrest Simulation Test (CASTest), a validated scoring system, was used to evaluate performance on a standardized simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Mixed effect logistic regression models were constructed to assess outcomes.RESULTS: On the pre-course simulation exam, only 7.7% of subjects passed the test. Immediately post-course, the subjects achieved a 30.8% pass rate and at 6 months after the course, the pass rate was 46.2%. Compared with pre-test scores, the odds of passing the CASTest at 6 months after the course were 21.7 times higher (95% CI 4.2 to 112.8, P<0.001). Statistically significant improvement was also seen on the number of critical items completed (OR=3.75, 95% CI 2.71-5.19), total items completed (OR=4.55, 95% CI 3.4-6.11), and number of ""excellent"" scores on a Likert scale (OR=2.66, 95% CI 1.85-3.81).CONCLUSIONS: Nicaraguan resident physicians demonstrate improved ability to manage simulated cardiac arrest scenarios after participation in the Project SEMILLA resuscitation course and retain these skills.","Emergency medicine; Heart arrest; Logistic models; Nicaragua; Resuscitation","clinical competence; curriculum; education; emergency medicine; female; heart arrest; human; male; medical education; Nicaragua; physician; resuscitation; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Emergency Medicine; Female; Heart Arrest; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Nicaragua; Physicians; Resuscitation","UL1 TR000124; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS: UL1TR000124",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020050765

Nevertheless, the various forms of interacting with this kind of software have not been widely investigated. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we carried out a literature review regarding the multiple types of interactions offered by GUI of IG software. We searched five digital libraries and collected 998 papers covering more than ten years (2004-2014) of research in the field. As a result we verified that: 1) most of the studies focused on desktop interfaces based on keyboard and mouse; 2) few efforts have been carried out on the design of IG software for devices with multitouch interfaces. By categorising the contributions of papers according to their goal and research approach we hope to organise the valuable contributions of the community and give directions for further research to build better GUI for IG software.

In particular, through an experimental study the nature of the analogies in the posing problem process is analyzed. In order to achieve the former, we study the effect caused by the epistemic basis of instruction, the quality of the analogy and its localization in the cognitive framework. The empirical evidences suggest that in classroom, both the contextual as structural nature strongly respond to the encouragement of critical thinking. © 2016, Foundation Journal of Science Education.

And the other hand, the concept of accountability in Brazil has become associated with a single measure of government control and the one most easily associated with human resource management.

Objective: Analyze some postgraduate students’ perception about the critical reading of medical articles as an educative strategy for learning the research methodology. Methods: Through an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional and prolective research, we studied 36 students of a master’s degree course on Medical Sciences, with an emphasis on clinical research. They were conducted an anonymous survey made up by six items, in order to inquire into the perception about the usefulness of an educative strategy, both active and participative, for learning the research methodology. To analyze the results, we used descriptive statistics as based on averages, standard deviation and percentages. For statistical significance of the percentages, we calculated the confidence interval at 95 %. Results: 36 students of a master’s degree course in Medical Sciences from a particular University in Tampico (in southern Tamaulipas State) were studied.

The application of mobile technology learning, Mobile learning, within the educative context has established new parameters in educative ergonomics, which has facilitated the continuous access to information. Its positioning generates new paradigms, whose valorizations should be properly studied. Objective: Describe the assessment of mobile learning in the teaching process of health students. Methods: This research of quantitative character used descriptive statistics. The information was gathered by survey, and tabulated in Spss15 ®. We obtained a sample of 202 majoring subjects from the Health School of Universidad de Desarrollo, Chile. Results: The polled indicated that the most widely used technologies are the laptop (47 %) and the smartphone (42 %), which are in turn constituted as the most important (laptop: 56 %; smartphone: 21 %). 28.7 % of those who used a laptop to study assess it positively, a perception that goes down to a 21 % in the use of the smartphone (both with p= 0.00). This technology is generally used for searching information (27 %). Conclusions: We have concluded that mobile technologies become important within the learning process of higher education students. The traditional technologies (desktop computer) are scarcely used. The generation of a study network is evaluated, a reason why using mobile learning positively contributes to maintaining this type of communication. © 2016, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

In Venezuela there are no investigations of student satisfaction, and that is the reason for this exploratory study of a positivist nature, wherefrom knowledge can be drawn about various factors involved in student satisfaction concerning educational quality within the Cell Biology Department. The information was obtained applying a previously validated instrument with a Likert scale of 5 points, which was applied to 80 students in the Department of Cell Biology between the sixth and ninth semester. The results revealed which factors of the tuition services offered by the institution are generators of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in the students. These results can be used by the Faculty authorities for decisions taking, improvement search, or control of issues that may arise over time.

We show how, in this way, students become what Lave and Wenger call legitimate peripheral members of a community of practice, which here is the classroom. Then we consider the dynamics of the classroom through what Costa calls problematization, subverting the secular and/or cultural tradition of placing the teacher in the central position and students in peripheral positions. Finally, we consider this dynamic from the psychological point of view, showing, based on Valsiner's idea of internalization-externalization, how ready and built knowledge may acquire a personal and affective meaning for the student through the use of an example in a geometry class.","Appropriation; Dialogue; Externalization; Internalization; Problematization",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008414125

There was a significant amount of undergraduates with a license to teach (53%) who were not practicing or who were not willing to practice the teaching profession. The resulting data may help understand the disturbing deficit of teachers to work in the public basic education in Brazil. Results have shown that the greatest difficulties found by the practicing teachers participating in this study are associated with students and their families, and are the consequence of lack of interest and indiscipline expressed by pupils. The major cause for abandoning the teaching profession, among those herein researched, is due to the feeling of professionally undervalued as well as to the working conditions in the schools.

Studies using this method have shown evidence of validity and reliability. There are no published studies of OSCE reliability measurement with generalizability theory (G-theory) in Latin America. The aims of this study were to assess the reliability of an OSCE in medical students using G-theory and explore its usefulness for quality improvement. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Faculty of Medicine in Mexico City. A total of 278 fifth-year medical students were assessed with an 18-station OSCE in a summative end-of-career final examination. There were four exam versions. G-theory with a crossover random effects design was used to identify the main sources of variance. Examiners, standardized patients, and cases were considered as a single facet of analysis. Results: The exam was applied to 278 medical students. The OSCE had a generalizability coefficient of 0.93. The major components of variance were stations, students, and residual error. The sites and the versions of the tests had minimum variance. Conclusions: Our study achieved a G coefficient similar to that found in other reports, which is acceptable for summative tests. G-theory allows the estimation of the magnitude of multiple sources of error and helps decision makers to determine the number of stations, test versions, and examiners needed to obtain reliable measurements. © 2016 Juan Andrés Trejo-Mejía et al.","Clinical competence; Generalizability theory; Mexico; OSCE; Reliability","career; clinical competence; clinical examination; cross-sectional study; human; major clinical study; medical student; medicine; Mexico City; reliability; theoretical model; total quality management; university; clinical competence; education; medical education; Mexico; procedures; reproducibility; standards; theoretical model; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Medical; Educational Measurement; Humans; Mexico; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85004107962

However in spite of the numerous studies conducted in the country since PROUCA was launched, Brazil shows a lack of proficiency in basic information crucial for managing and improving any OLPC initiative (e.g., number of effectively used laptops, use time and distribution per subject, use location and school performance of users, and others). Therefore, the focus of this article is to introduce MEMORE, a computational environment for longitudinal on-line data collection, integration and an analysis of how PROUCA laptops are used by schools. Technical details about MEMORE's architecture, database and functional models are supplied and the results from real data collected from Brazilian public schools are presented and analyzed.

Specifically, this paper analyzes certain internal and strategic factors associated with universities, such as prestige, public or private status, age, size (measured by the number of faculty members or students) and region. Design/methodology: We apply a descriptive methodology and then use multivariate analysis to test five hypotheses related to the institutional profile of 151 universities in 29 countries. Empirical evidence is provided from universities offering MOOCs through the four of the most commonly used private global platforms that emerged as part of the booming MOOC movement (Udacity, Coursera, edX and MiríadaX). Findings: The findings show some differences when prestige is measured according to the Shanghai ranking (model 1) and the Webometrics ranking (model 2). In both cases, the private nature of the university and the region (North America) are factors that have a significant influence on the MOOC university supply. Depending on both rankings, size and age are influential factors. It is important to emphasize that prestige is a significant factor according to model 2. Research limitations/implications: MOOCs are a phenomenon with a growing trend, and for which the supply data change frequently. Therefore, the results of our empirical research are limited to a specific period. Practical implications: This paper provides new empirical evidence for use in future studies to analyze and compare the behavior of the MOOC supply by different universities. Social implications: This study contributes to the comprehension of the factors that influence the extent to which universities participate in the MOOC supply. It also suggests relevant aspects for innovation policies in university education, since universities must make strategic decisions in a competitive environment that affects their institutional philosophy. Originality/value: This paper makes an empirical contribution to the existing international literature on MOOC supply. It analyzes the relevance of the factor of prestige, as measured by two university rankings, Webometrics, the emphasis of which is focused on visibility on the Internet, and Shanghai, in which emphasis is placed on the impact on scientific research.","Higher education; Massive Open Online Courses; MOOC platforms; MOOC supply; Prestige; Universities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002834113

This paper analyzes the arithmetic problems posed by a group of mathematically talented students when given two problem-posing tasks, and compares these students' responses to those given by a standard group of public school students to the same tasks. Our analysis focuses on characterizing and identifying the differences between the productions of both groups, based on an analytic framework designed in this study. Method. The sample is composed of two groups of students. The first consists of 21 students identified as mathematically talented and the second of 20 secondary students in a public school. Both groups completed two tasks of posing arithmetic problems designed in this study. The results were analyzed based on three categories of analysis and variables related to the problems' syntactic, semantic, and mathematical structure. Results. The problems posed by the group of mathematically talented students are richer than those of the group of public school students. The talented students' problems are composed of a greater number of propositions, use different types of numbers, require more steps and different calculation processes to solve, and have a higher number of different semantic relationships. Furthermore, the results show some attributes that enable us to characterize mathematically talented students when solving problem-posing tasks. Conclusion. The problem-posing instrument and the analytical diagram enabled description and exploration of the performance of a group of mathematically talented students. Moreover, the three categories of analysis used and the solvability of each problem produced ten components whose values characterize the wealth of problems that the subjects invented. Finally, statistical analysis reinforces the differences between the productions of the two study groups. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Arithmetic problems; Mathematical talent; Mathematics education; Problem posing; Richness of statements",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995680444

This approach both simplifies the wave equation making it linear as the relationship between the tension and the speed of the wave. However, this procedure restricts the experiments and requires the use of sensors and/or more expensive equipments to extract reliable data. In contrast, the aim of this work was to create and analyze a cheap and efficient educational experiment to obtain the relationship between the speed and the tension of a pulse and the linear density of a rope, whose mass was not negligible. In this situation, the rope is not straight, but hangs due to its own weight forming a curve called catenary. For data collection were employed only a camera of a smartphone and a free video analysis software. Different theoretical models applied in interpreting the results enabled a wide and deeper understanding of the experiment. The results showed a variation in the accuracy and precision according to the mathematical models adopted. This provided an interesting view, that is, the experimental work depends not only on the equipment used, but is entangled with the respective theories.

However, conflicts are generated and the quality of this level of education is below expectations. This study aims to analyze the perception of knowledge of teachers who work at this level of education on issues related to the inclusion of children with disabilities in regular classes and how they proceed in these cases. It is a field study with a random sample of classroom teachers and physical education teachers, which used a questionnaire about: autonomy, social inclusion, the specificity of children with disabilities, evaluation, adaptation, and possibilities of body movement. The first part of each question referred to teachers' perception of their knowledge on the subject, in a Likert scale, and the second part asked teachers to give examples of how they would act. For most questions, more than half the group of teachers stated they had poor knowledge, and most preferred to present justifications rather than examples of actions that could be undertaken. The few examples given demonstrated superficiality in addressing the issues and or lack of knowledge. There is a paradox: it is desirable that education occurs earlier and earlier, to promote a more equitable society, but the care of these children and to their full development may be at risk. It is necessary to enrich the dialogue between different sectors of society.","Body practices; Care; Disabilities; Early childhood education; Social inclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994477261

In the face of the supposed evidence that boys have superior performance in mathematics, this study aims to investigate possible problematizations of mathematics education when we relate it to gender issues, that is, masculinities, femininities, and other social representations aligned to this approach. It also investigates the consequences that certain conceptions of gender implicit in the teaching practice may have on mathematics teaching. Indeed, it is not uncommon to encounter statements such as ""boys are better at mathematics than girls"", or ""women are very emotional and not rational enough"", which can bring consequences to mathematics teaching, such as the legitimation and reaffirmation of certain inequalities already materialized in the social sphere. In order to challenge such claims that may somehow end up playing a key role in fixing certain binarisms of gender identities, this work presents a poststructuralist discussion and, by means of semi-structured interviews with mathematics teachers, investigates how gender relations are present in the teaching of this subject.","Discourses; Educational practices; Gender; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994474502

However, one of the criticisms this program gets is that it would not be able to include students with socioeconomic profile very different from those who would pass the ""vestibular"" (in Brazil, it is an exam which classifies candidates to a university according to their score), regardless of the program's actions. Thus, the objective of this work is to obtain in-depth knowledge of some the Inclup's indicators, with the aim of providing a better answer to the question: who the program has been contributing to include in USP? More specifically, some socioeconomic data are examined from students who entered USP this way. We compared the socioeconomic profile, for the three most and least attractive degree courses, of students in general, of those coming from PS and, among them, of those who were admitted at USP as a result of getting a bonus granted by Inclusp. The analysis of the socioeconomic indicators shows that the program has contributed to include PS students from families with a family income lower than their peers who also come from a PS. Notwithstanding, it also points to the fact that there is no variation in the education level of the father between those two groups, which indicates that, whereas Inclusp helps reduce the economic disadvantage, it has not been able, generally speaking, of eliminating cultural obstacles that prevent or make it difficult the access of students from working class backgrounds to the University of Sao Paulo.","Affirmative actions; Class groups; Public universities; Working",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994462082

With this aim, four aspects are analyzed: Organization of mathematical thinking through communication; communication of mathematical thinking; analysis and evaluation of the strategies and mathematical thought of others; and expression of mathematical ideas using mathematical language. The research was conducted from a qualitative approach on an exploratory level, with the case study method of 4 classrooms of second grade of secondary education in a private school in Lima. The observational technique of 20 publications in the blog of the math class was applied; a study of a focal group with a sample of 9 students with different levels of academic performance; and an interview with the academic coordinator of the school was conducted. The results show that the organization of mathematical thinking through communication is carried out in the blog in a written, graphical and oral way through explanations, schemes and videos. Regarding communication of mathematical thinking, the blog is used to describe concepts, arguments and mathematical procedures with words and examples of the students. The analysis and evaluation of the strategies and mathematical thinking is performed through comments and debates about the publications. It was also noted that the blog does not facilitate the use of mathematical language to express mathematical ideas, since it does not allow direct writing of symbols nor graphic representation. © 2016, Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The purpose of this paper is to outline an approach that has a potential for application in other parts of Latin America and perhaps more broadly in other world regions sharing some of the same challenges and opportunities as found in Mexico. Design/methodology/approach: The implemented collaborative framework enabled a transformation of disciplinary research and teaching at UNAM into a postgraduate programme designed to generate cutting-edge educational and research capabilities. The approach to curriculum and programme design emphasized the process and methodological framework for curriculum development as much as the outcome itself. It entailed three primary elements: theory on collaborative processes; the curriculum design approach; and a formative and summative evaluation. Findings: Several of the challenges faced were related to the nature of the institution (mainly because of the complexity of its organization and the emphasis in maintaining disciplinary boundaries), as well as to the curriculum development and design approach (acceptance of a competency-based programme appropriate for the MSc but considered restrictive for the PhD). The experience the authors relate in this paper exemplifies how to cope with such challenges. The approach enabled the emergence of a shared vision that was appropriated by all the participants. This ultimately empowered them in the presentation of the curriculum to their disciplinary peers. Furthermore, the approach facilitated the creation of a programme that remained salient along the process, while increasingly gained legitimacy and credibility among the academic community. Social implications: In Mexico, the number of sustainability practitioners and scientists is still insufficient, and there is a clear lack of capacities in key themes and tools. UNAM combines a strong scientific tradition and a foundational mandate to serve both the country and humanity and is, thus, a natural platform for developing a higher education programme in sustainability science. The approach taken in the development of UNAM’s programme has useful lessons for the development of similar programmes in other developing nations facing similar educational and institutional challenges. Originality/value: This model not only resulted in an innovative and novel programme in sustainability education but also, in the process, strengthened the competencies of diverse stakeholders through a systematic collaborative framework that fosters sustainability as a social learning process. Such experience illustrates the advantages of implementing a collaborative approach to enable the emergence of a critical mass capable to handle the diversity presupposed by a curriculum in sustainability science. It also shows how such a collaborative process can be implemented to overcome the limited resources, lack of experience in sustainability education and strong disciplinary focus that hampers the advancement of higher education in institutions similar to UNAM. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaborative framework; Mexico; Postgraduate programme; Sustainability science; Transdisciplinary; UNAM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978032633

Available packages, particularly for system dynamics simulation methodology, do not overcome this gap, because they were not designed within the framework of user interface and user experience design. Therefore, the simulation tool itself becomes a barrier to learning this methodology. In this article, the authors present a new visual and interactive design for system dynamics modelling, which could foster the experience for the user. To test this design, prototype software, Flux, was implemented on the iPad tablet platform.

To achieve this goal, 61 children aged between 7 and 9 years old were divided in two groups, the first group was formed by students with high or superior achievement in Spanish, and other was formed by those with basic or lower achievement in Spanish. Results allowed to identify and compare errors and grammatical categories used from both groups. Differences and similarities were found in both groups such as the following mistakes: omission, substitutions, additions, translocations, orthographic mistakes, mirror-writing, word joining and segmentation. We concluded that omission and addition are the most common errors. Also, it was found that the occurrence of errors in reading assignments is less common in children with high achievement, presenting better precision, and therefore a greater generalization of phonological structure of words. However, a greater number of errors were found in writing tasks with these children due to the larger quantity of written words.","Academic achievement; Reading failures; Reading writing relationship; Writing difficulties",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973922749

It is then confusing to find renowned books on the subject that refer to these symbols as if they were indeed a tensor. A prominent example of such a book is the one written by Rober Wald [1], which has been embraced as a textbook on the matter by a large amount of prestigious institutions around the globe. The simplest alternative would be to think that the books just mentioned provide a wrong description of the Christoffel symbols, but this is not the case. Understanding the mathematical foundation of why some authors treat the Christoffel symbols as a tensor provides valuable insight about the nature of the metric connection in General Relativity, and that is why in this paper we dedicate the space to provide the needed analysis.

It seems that learning outcomes improve where pedagogical leadership is present and where there is counseling and intervention of principals in the design of the curriculum. This article is based on data from the 2012 Report for eight Latin American countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. In particular, the views of principals in relation to ""curriculum, school policies and practices"" are analyzed. The findings show a very diverse and heterogeneous reality regarding leadership practices in the examined countries. Among other main results of the study, it is noted that in a number of countries, managers do not base their practices on a precise and written formulation of standards for improving learning. In addition, it seems that the promotion of trust and self-confidence in teachers by principals is exceptional.

These people have difficulties in skills requiring attention, memory, reasoning, generalization and abstraction, which are fundamental to academic learning. Studies on math skills, both for people with intellectual disabilities as those with typical development, point to the lack of assessment of these skills under continuous point of view (as measurements and geometry), but on the other hand, it is strong enough regarding discrete aspects of mathematics (such as counting, arithmetic and numbers). Thus, this research aimed to identify strategies, taught content, and the input repertoire for teaching math to people with intellectual disabilities, giving priority to empirical research in the literature. As a result, the review in the database 15 articles that met the criteria. The data indicated three themes for analysis: math content, input repertoire and teaching strategies. It is concluded that there is a reduced number of studies on the teaching of mathematics to people with intellectual disabilities. In addition, it is clear that there is still a long way to go in the search of an inclusive school, where these people have access to elementary mathematics. © 2016.

The sample was composed of 11 individuals with ID, aged between 18 and 40 years. The program was conducted over 30 classes, with 2 classes per week, each lasting 1 hour and 20 minutes. For purposes of data analysis, formal games, lasting 8 minutes during preintervention and post-intervention were video recorded, observing the frequency of the following game actions: moving forward with the ball and/or dribbling, passing the ball to other teammate, kicking towards the goal, positioning in pitch so as to be an option to receive a pass, marking between the forwards and the goal, man-to-man marking, late marking - all these classified as positive actions - and kicking the ball with no direction, making a pass with no direction, not attacking and not marking - all these were classified as negative. As a result, at the end of the program, it could be noted that 9 individuals showed an increase in frequency of actions, whereas only 2 individuals showed similar frequency of actions both before and after intervention, which means an enhance in the game engagement, as well as an increased number of positive actions. In conclusion, it is believed that a program based on strategic/tactical game model that meet the individuals’ demands and that address content derived from tactical viewpoints of CSGs teaching can be a rather interesting scenario for this population. © 2016, All rights resetrved.","Intelectual Disability; Physical Education; Special Education; Sport for Disabled Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964739535

This paper presents analyses in relation to the identification of Action Units (AUs) related to affective states and their impact on learning with a tutoring system. To assess affect, a tool was devised to identify AUs on pictures of human faces. Action Units are combinations of individual facial muscles or groups of muscles that create facial expressions in association with affect. Pictures from a population of students were taken while using an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics in a secondary school in a suburban school in Veracruz, Mexico. The students were asked to interact with the tutoring system for 40 minutes and they were photographed with the tool at a rate of 1 picture every 5 seconds acquiring a dataset consisting of 16,800 photos. To achieve identification, the software analyzes individual pictures using Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Euclidian distance. The tool developed to classify affective states shows 88.88% accuracy in the identification of AUs when matching the recognized AU to the Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded facial expression database. The analyses also elicited the most common AUs for the population and their association with learning with the intelligent tutoring system. These preliminary results shed light on the issues of affect in relation to learning mathematics with tutoring systems and pave the way for the implementation of coping strategies based on the automatic recognition of facial expressions.","Action units; Affect; Intelligent tutoring system",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964549181

By using this methodology, productivity growth can be split into two parts: Change in technical efficiency and technological change. The results show that an annual average change in productivity of -1.1% was recorded across all universities, with a range between -15.2% and 18.3%, which confirms the hypothesis that the Spanish Public University System is greatly heterogeneous regarding change in productivity over time. However, there are some considerable differences in the change in productivity over time when only research and only teaching are analyzed, with an annual average growth of 14.6% and 6.1% respectively. In the case of research activity, the positive changes are mainly the result of technological progress and greater productivity encouraged by the incentive system for high-impact research by teachers.","Malmquist index; Productivity; Technical efficiency; Technological change; Universities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964323881

Methodologically, the study was undertaken using a qualitative, multi-situated approach that focussed on the dynamics of the New Opportunities Centres, particularly on educators in the field of ""Mathematics for Life"", most of whom were formerly mathematics teachers in the mainstream education system. Using the official Portuguese documents as a reference framework, the results of the content analysis of the interviews conducted with the adult educators revealed dilemmas and challenges. These were analysed from the perspective of new teaching practices that educators in the ""Mathematics for Life"" field need to develop and implement in this particular model of adult education, the diversity amongst the adults who use the RVCC system, and the need to decode and adapt official documents in this specific area. Our research shows that the recognition, validation, and certification of competencies (RVCC) process tends to encourage adult educators in the ""Mathematics for Life"" area to take a dialogical stance that legitimates the daily mathematical knowledge of adults in a way that resembles an ethnomathematics perspective. The results indicate both new attitudes and professional practices related to the search for new teaching methodologies, and methodologies for the validation of learning, expanding previous perspectives and developing the process of identity, as well as the understanding of the meaning of becoming an adult educator in a more holistic way, contextualised within the reality of adult education.","""Mathematics for life""; Adult education; Ethnomathematics; Professional practices; RVCC",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963767544

The aim of this study was to describe how bullying occurs in high social vulnerability schools of Florianópolis metropolitan area and the roles played by students in this phenomenon. Overall, 409 children and adolescents from the 3rd to 5th grades and of two public elementary schools aged 8-16 years (X = 11.14) participated in this study. As a tool, the Olweus Questionnaire adapted to the Brazilian population was used. For data analysis, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were applied by the Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests. As for results, 29.8% of boys and 40.5% of girls reported being victims; 32.3% of boys and 24.6% of girls reported being bullies. Victims were the most willing to help a colleague who is suffering from bullying (X = 1.54; p> 0.001), even if they do not know the victims (X = 1.57; p> 0.004). Bullies are differentiated from the group that does not participate (X = 1.73) and the group of victims (X = 2.34), being those who felt less alone (x = 1.47; p> 0.001). It was concluded that the information obtained in this study is indispensable in the search for alternatives to reduce school bullying. The strengthening of relations between school and students and a better preparation of teachers and school staff are extremely necessary to try to minimize the effects of risk factors to which these children are exposed and consequently violence at school.","Bullying; School; Social vulnerability",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963765720

In this research, we propose a prediction technique for predicting the effort of software projects individually developed by graduate students. In accordance with the complexity of a software project, it can be developed among teams, by a team or even at individual level. The teaching and training about development effort prediction of software projects represents a concern in environments related to academy and industry because underprediction causes cost overruns, whereas overprediction often involves missed financial opportunities. Effort prediction techniques of individually developed projects have mainly been based on expert judgment or based on mathematical models. This research proposes the application of a mathematical model termed Radial Basis function Neural Network (RBFNN). The hypothesis to be tested is the following: effort prediction accuracy of a RBFNN is statistically better than that obtained from a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The projects were developed by following a disciplined development process in controlled environments. The RBFNNandMLRwere trained from a data set of 328 projects developed by 82 students between the years 2005 and 2010, then, the models were tested using a data set of 116 projects developed by 29 students between the years 2011 and first semester of 2012. Results suggest that aRBFNNhaving as independent variables new and changed code, reused code and programming language experience of students can be used at the 95.0% confidence level for predicting the development effort of individual projects when they have been developed based upon a disciplined process in academic environments. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.","Laboratory learning environments; Multiple linear regression; Radial basis function neural network; Software development effort prediction","Complex networks; Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Forecasting; Functions; Linear regression; Radial basis function networks; Software design; Teaching; Controlled environment; Higher education students; Independent variables; Learning environments; Multiple linear regressions; Prediction techniques; Radial basis function neural networks; Software development effort predictions; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962617966

We classified the results based on the type of numerical problem posed, the level of curricular content involved and the cognitive domain assessed by each question. We found that Spanish future primary teachers had sufficient knowledge of the primary and lower secondary content questions with the exception of working with the concepts of reason / proportion / percentage and the translation of a simple subtraction of fractions into a word problem. Even though they reported knowing about the density of irrational numbers, Spanish future teachers showed insufficient knowledge of advanced mathematics content.

Improving obstetric and neonatal emergency care can improve health outcomes. Weevaluated the impact of PRONTO, a simulation-based low-cost obstetric and neonatal emergency and team training program on patient outcomes. Methods: We conducted a pair-matched hospital-based trial in Mexico from 2010 to 2013 with 24 public hospitals. Obstetric and neonatal care providers participated in PRONTO trainings at intervention hospitals. Control hospitals received no intervention. Outcome measures included hospital-based neonatal mortality, maternal complications, and cesarean delivery. We fitted mixed-effects negative binomial regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals using a difference-indifferences approach, cumulatively, and at follow-up intervals measured at 4, 8, and 12 months. Results: There was a significant estimated impact of PRONTO on the incidence of cesarean sections in intervention hospitals relative to controls adjusting for baseline differences during all 12 months cumulative of follow-up (21% decrease, P = 0.005) and in intervals measured at 4 (16% decrease, P = 0.02), 8 (20% decrease, P = 0.004), and 12 months' (20% decrease, P = 0.003) follow-up. We found no statistically significant impact of the intervention on the incidence of maternal complications. A significant impact of a 40% reduction in neonatal mortality adjusting for baseline differences was apparent at 8 months postintervention but not at 4 or 12 months. Conclusions: PRONTO reduced the incidence of cesarean delivery and may improve neonatal mortality, although the effect on the latter might not be sustainable. Further study is warranted to confirm whether obstetric and neonatal emergency simulation and team training can have lasting results on patient outcomes.

In this multi-session experiment, third grade students working on arithmetic exercises from various curricular units were divided into three groups. The first group used personal computers (netbooks), the second group used an interpersonal computer (ie, one projector with a screen, one computer and one mouse per child) and the third group used pen-and-paper. The results of the experiment indicate that all three groups achieved an increase in learning, as shown by the pretest and posttest scores. No significant difference was found between the interpersonal computer and personal computer groups. This suggests that the key characteristic shared by the two groups is the provision of feedback. The format that such feedback takes, either private (through a personal screen) or public (through a shared screen), is shown to make no difference. However, the results significantly favour groups that are provided with instant feedback (interpersonal computer and personal computer) as opposed to delayed feedback (pen-and-paper). © 2015 British Educational Research Association.",,"E-learning; Paper; Students; Delayed feedback; Key characteristics; Second group; Student learning outcomes; Personal computers; Computers; Experimentation",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954184325

To start filling this gap this qualitative research has the aim to identify emotional experiences of undergraduate mathematics students in Linear Algebra courses. In order to obtain data, retrospective focus group interviews were carried out with 27 students. Data analysis is based on the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies eliciting conditions for each emotion and the variables that affect intensity of emotions. Results show that the participants’ emotional experiences in Linear Algebra courses are: satisfaction and disappointment emotions, fear emotions, distress emotions and self-reproach emotions. These emotions are triggered by the appraisal of different situations like the difficulty attributed to Linear Algebra courses, solving problems, asking questions in class, going to the blackboard to solve problems and failure in a course. The students’ emotional experiences are based on their appraisal of the situations in terms of specific goals and standards.

These measures are representative of assessment methods largely used in the elementary school. The aims were: (1) to verify the extent to which TRS and MLTs can be predicted by external criteria collected at kindergarten and (2) to estimate the degree to which each measure might be biased by family, teacher and children's characteristics. A total of 239 children were assessed during kindergarten. At the end of the first grade, they were tested for social-emotional adjustment and academic achievement (TRS and MLTs). Results suggest that family socioeconomic status and children's school readiness at kindergarten were associated with both measures; however, the predictors accounted for significantly more variance in TRS than in MLTs. Regarding the presence of bias, results indicate that TRS seems more sensitive to children's social competence, whereas the MLTs appears to be more sensitive to pupils' anxiety. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","academic achievement; elementary school students; standardized achievement test; teacher judgement",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947484854

Nevertheless there is a deficit in Cancer Education in Brazilian medical schools (MS). Projects called Academic Leagues (AL) have been gaining attention. However, there are few studies on this subject. AL arise from student initiative, arranged into different areas, on focus in general knowledge, universal to any medical field. They are not obligatory and students are responsible for the organizing and planning processes of AL, so participation highlights the motivation to active pursuit of knowledge. The objective of this study was to explore the relevance of AL, especially on the development of important skills and attitudes for medical students. Methods: A survey was undertaken in order to assess the number of AL Brazilian MS. After nominal list, a grey literature review was conducted to identify those with AL and those with Oncology AL. Results: One hundred eighty of the 234 MS were included. Only 4 MS selected held no information about AL and 74.4 % of them had AL in Oncology. The majority had records in digital media. The number of AL was proportional to the distribution of MS across the country, which was related to the number of inhabitants. Conclusions: The real impact and the potential of these projects can be truly understand by a qualitative analysis. AL are able to develop skills and competencies that are rarely stimulated whilst studying in traditional curriculum. This has positive effects on professional training, community approach through prevention strategies, and development on a personal level permitting a dynamic, versatile and attentive outlook to their social role. Besides stimulating fundamental roles to medical practice, students that participate in AL acquire knowledge and develop important skills such as management and leadership, entrepreneurship, innovation, health education, construction of citizenship. Oncology AL encourage more skilled care to patients and more effective policies for cancer control. © 2015 Ferreira et al.","Academic leagues; Cancer education; Medical education; Oncology; Students' skills","Brazil; education; educational model; human; leadership; medical education; medical research; medical school; medical student; neoplasm; oncology; organization and management; peer group; procedures; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; teaching; trends; Biomedical Research; Brazil; Education, Medical; Humans; Leadership; Medical Oncology; Models, Educational; Neoplasms; Peer Group; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952312842

Nevertheless, few studies have investigated EBP-related barriers amongst Latin-American physical therapists working in primary care. The primary objective of this study was to describe the current state concerning perceived barriers engagement in EBP among physical therapy in Colombia. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with barriers to implementation EBP. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. The study involved physical therapists working in public and private hospital who were contacted through professional networks (Email, Facebook®, ResearchGate® and Linked-In®) and invited to participate. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) were used for examining factors associated with perceived barriers to including EBP in their work. Results: The final sample size was 1064 (77.2 % female). Forty-one percent of the respondents indicated that a ""lack of research skills"" was the most important barrier to evidence being used in practice. MLR analysis suggested that several variables were associated with perceived barriers to including EBP: i.e. hours of work per week, current main role in therapy center and undergraduate degree. The MCA model established two groups of similarities regarding the different barriers; the ""lack of understanding of statistical analysis"", ""insufficient time"" and ""understanding of the English in which articles are written"" barriers were weighted more heavily regarding in the first group (the second factor on MCA) and the rest barriers on the second group (first factor on the MCA). Conclusions: Although most physiotherapists had a positive opinion regarding EBP, they considered that they needed to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes towards EBP. Initiatives to advance EBP in Colombia with no academic or research tradition should primarily target practitioner-level factors. © 2015 Ramírez-Vélez et al.","Barriers; Evidence-based practice; Physical therapy; Survey","Colombia; controlled study; correspondence analysis; e-mail; evidence based practice center; female; human; human experiment; male; model; multivariate logistic regression analysis; physician; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; private hospital; rest; sample size; skill; adult; clinical competence; Colombia; cross-sectional study; education; epidemiology; evidence based practice; health personnel attitude; methodology; middle aged; physiotherapist; primary health care; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Colombia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Practice; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Specialty; Primary Health Care; Research Design; Surveys and Questionnaires","Universidad del Rosario, UR; Universidad de La Sabana","The authors wish to thank all PTs, clinical instructors and teachers who kindly participated in the survey.

The data were obtained from the teacher and students (8 and 9-year-olds) of a forth-grade class from a Brazilian public elementary school. The main components of the data are the following: interviews, audio, and video recordings, a questionnaire and reports done by the teacher and students' records. Some of the identified potentialities are: encouragement to autonomy and creativity; development of students' argumentation and registering skills; search for different strategies mobilizing math knowledge. Limitations were also identified such as time to develop the tasks; break time between classes; children's lack of experience with argumentation and registering; unpredictability generated by the openness of the proposal. The potentialities raised point out to a possibility of using these tasks in the early grades, contributing not only to mathematics learning, but also to the development of competences such as respect and autonomy. The limitations observed were either overcome or minimized in many moments through the teacher's reflexive attitude and through team work.","Early Grades; Investigative Tasks; Mathematics Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953406437

In this article, I discuss connections between: (a) the mathematical strands and processes of the K-8 Ontario Mathematics Curriculum in Canada, and; (b) DMP produced by students. Based on the analysis of twenty-two DMP, I argue that DMP may offer ways to: (1) explore most of the mathematical processes of the Ontario Curriculum, and; (2) open windows into the exploration of math contents. I highlight the educational significance in practicing DMP as an innovative process that integrates multimodality, playfulness, and creativity. In contrast, I have found that the production of DMP does not guarantee the in-depth connection between the math strands and processes of the Curriculum.

The first section of the article presents aspects related to deafness and to the education of deaf people. In the following are presented the contexts of activity as well as excerpts of conversations in which students make agreement on the signs for different geometric figures, which were absent in the dictionaries. The results indicate the importance of the negotiation process for the enlargement of the lexical field in Libras, as well as for the engagement of students in the activity, as this process offers an opportunity to explore mathematical properties. Finally, it is acknowledged that the inclusion of disabled students in the regular school seems to be well supported by legislation concerning the access, although more efforts are still needed in order to ensure learning spaces for everybody.","Brazilian Sign Language; Geometry; Inclusive Education; Mathematics Education and Deafness; Teaching and Learning of Mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953376723

The use of digital tools helped to enhance the students’ interpretation of the relationships between the context and the mathematical model associated with it.

In this paper, some new types of uncertainty, which extend existing typologies, are identified and the contexts and strategies to deal with them are studied. Methods: We carried out a mixed-methods study, consisting of a qualitative and a quantitative phase. For the qualitative study, 128 residents reported critical incidents in their clinical practice and described how they coped with the uncertainty in the situation. Each critical incident was analyzed and the most salient situations, 45 in total, were retained. In the quantitative phase, a distinct group of 120 medical residents indicated for each of these situations whether they have been involved in the described situations and, if so, which coping strategy they applied. The analysis examines the relation between characteristics of the situation and the coping strategies. Results: From the qualitative study, a new typology of uncertainty was derived which distinguishes between technical, conceptual, communicational, systemic, and ethical uncertainty. The quantitative analysis showed that, independently of the type of uncertainty, critical incidents are most frequently resolved by consulting senior physicians (49 % overall), which underscores the importance of the hierarchical relationships in the hospital. The insights gained by this study are combined into an integrative model of uncertainty in medical residencies, which combines the type and perceived level of uncertainty, the strategies employed to deal with it, and context elements such as the actors present in the situation. The model considers the final resolution at each of three levels: the patient, the health system, and the physician's personal level. Conclusions: This study gives insight into how medical residents make decisions under different types of uncertainty, giving account of the context in which the interactions take place and of the strategies used to resolve the incidents. These insights may guide the development of organizational policies that reduce uncertainty and stress in residents during their clinical training. © 2015 Hamui-Sutton et al.","Clinical context; Coping strategies; Critical incidents; Decision making; Medical uncertainty; Resident education; Uncertainty typology","adaptive behavior; adult; female; human; male; medical education; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; task performance; uncertainty; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Task Performance and Analysis; Uncertainty","IN308614","We gratefully acknowledge the logistical support of the doctors Francisco González Martínez, Carmen Cedillo Pérez, José Halabe Cherem, and Carlos Lavalle Montalvo, which strongly facilitated the data collection.

It is usually explained by the impact of student attributes; however, recent developments in student success literature point to the need of exploring institutional practices that may impact a student's decision to abandon their studies. The current weight of academic quality assurance for Colombian higher education institutions (HEI) and what such measures may mean for how HEI fulfill their missions indicates the need to consider a possible relation between such quality measures and undergraduate student attrition. Using official databases from the Colombian Ministry of Education for the year 2009, this study explores through analysis of variance the relationship between attrition and three measures of academic quality: accreditation status, professional test scores required to graduate (Saber Pro Exam) and the number of research groups at HEI. The scope of the study is the Colombian Caribbean region and the sample includes 19 HEI.

We address this question through an interpretative analysis of a whole-group conversation in a sixth grade class taught by an experienced teacher in a school in Southern Argentina. The extended interaction (circa 160 speaker turns) concerned a problem involving remainders that calls for building a direct formula and expressing it in symbolic algebraic language. Our functional-grammatical analysis of the selected conversation revealed that, in synch with the deployment and use of the function table, the manner in which the teacher worded her questions was instrumental to the simultaneous accomplishment of three goals. First, her use of the personal pronouns “I” and “we” with generalized referents helped shape a collective zone of proximal development for the class to think aloud together about the algebraizing task at hand. Second, her verb choices supported students in moving among material, mental, operative, and relational processes on the road toward the targeted formula. Finally, by means of repetition, conjunction, demonstrative pronouns, and pointing gestures, the teacher molded the conversation as a coherent and cohesive multi-semiotic text. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947235940

The application consists of a graphical user interface in MATLAB, and a low-cost FPGA Xilinx Spartan 6, which in that way form a powerful and low-cost design station adequate to perform a number of CS experiments. Reconstruction of signals is carried out using a Greedy algorithm which solves the underdetermined system in real time with a novel Chebyshev-type matrix inversion.

This paper studies the relationship between the secondary school track attended by Chilean students (vocational or academic) and their subsequent outcomes in access to and persistence in postsecondary vocational programs. Although it is expected that vocational students will display lower access to higher education programs, due to their less intense curriculum and the generally non-academic environment of their schools, their performance in post-secondary vocational programs is unclear. Field-specific knowledge and vocational maturity could improve the performance of students from secondary vocational education backgrounds. Our analysis uses propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and determine causal relationships. It also utilizes sensitivity analysis to check for the robustness of results. The findings reveal that, indeed, vocational students have lower rates of access and persistence than academic ones. Students who change fields between secondary and postsecondary education have the lowest persistence levels. We also found that vocational students have lower probabilities of access to higher education funding, and higher probabilities of enrolling in evening classes. Thus, when controlling for these two characteristics, we found that students who continue in the same vocational field between secondary and postsecondary levels had a better performance than students with an academic background. These findings may suggest that vocational students require greater support in order to increase their probabilities of success in higher education. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Higher education; Higher education academic performance; Higher education attrition; Vocational education",,"781204034; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT","We thank the data provided by the Centro de Estudios from the Ministry of Education-Chile.

In order to support learning, recommender systems for TEL need to consider specific requirements, which differ from the requirements for recommender systems in other domains like e-commerce. Consequently, these particular requirements motivate the incorporation of specific goals and methods in the evaluation process for TEL recommender systems. In this article, the diverse evaluation methods that have been applied to evaluate TEL recommender systems are investigated. A total of 235 articles are selected from major conferences, workshops, journals, and books where relevant work have been published between 2000 and 2014. These articles are quantitatively analysed and classified according to the following criteria: type of evaluation methodology, subject of evaluation, and effects measured by the evaluation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure of the self-efficacy sources scale in Mathematics (Usher & Pajares, 2009) and the academic performance model proposed by the Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent, Brown & Hackett, 1994), considering the self-efficacy sources, self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, and goals. Method. We evaluated 574 Argentinean teenagers (between 12 and 16 years of age, M = 13.73). Results. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model fitted the data well. Regarding internal consistency, the four self-efficacy sources reported adequate values (>.70). Nevertheless, vicarious experience presented low reliability. Structural equation modeling also indicated that Social Cognitive Career Theory performance model fits adequately to the local population in our study. The contribution of self-efficacy sources to self-efficacy beliefs was consistent with other research. In the case of outcome expectations, there was only a significant contribution from vicarious learning and physiological and emotional states. Discussion. We discuss these results and analize the limitations in order to propose further studies. © 2015 Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Academic performance; Argentinean teenagers; Mathematics; Self-efficacy; Self-efficacy sources; Social cognitive career theory; Social cognitive theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960925680

Its distribution between administrative institutions (public and private) and between private categories (philanthropic, community, confessional and particular) was also analyzed as a way to understand the public/private relationship in the implementation of educational access policies for these individuals in RS. The issues considered relevant to this analysis were built through an articulated view towards the social indicators obtained through the microdata provided by Basic Education Census (2007-2013) and the Brazilian Census (2010) databases. It was found that the concentration of enrollment of these individuals occurs in substitute service, through EJA special classes, which presents very intense performance by philanthropic institutions in the state. Thus, we can infer that, with respect to young and adult lifetimes, intergovernmental political actions of Special Education in focus are in imbalance with the intensifying trend of school inclusion policy expressed in the total numbers of general enrollment Basic Education, in both contexts. In addition, the guarantee of the right education of youth and adults with disabilities remains a marginal aspect in Rio Grande do Sul state and in Brazil. © 2015, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

This reality has stimulated the discussion concerning the specific needs of this population and has influenced the creation of quality of life assessment instruments directly related to this particular scenario. This study aims to analyze the adequacy of WHOQOL- DIS, quality of life assessment instrument in persons with disabilities, to the principles that led to its construction. The research is qualitative in nature. Content analysis was the technical procedure adopted for data processing. This analysis was directed to the theoretical guidelines that support the interest of World Health Organization in the construction of WHOQOL-DIS. With content analysis, we sought, on the principles of creation of this instrument, data to assess the two versions of the instrument: the international version and the Brazilian version. Results showed that there are four issues present in the Brazilian version that are not available in the international version. One of these four questions is directly related to the underlying conceptual evolution of disability: accessibility and autonomy. Based on the investigated documentation, it is possible to argue that the absence of this question in the international version suggests distancing from the initial goal. In conclusion, the difference between the Brazilian version and the international version of WHOQOL-DIS is the loss, in the latter, of what the most important is in such an instrument: the valuation of what is meaningful to the audience to whom the instrument is designed. © 2015, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

Here, we evaluate if inhibitory processes play a specific role in the particular case of fraction comparison, where learners must ignore the potentially misleading information provided by the natural numbers composing fractions (e.g. 2/3 > 4/7 despite 2 < 4 and 3 < 7). To do this, we presented a sample of Chilean children (N = 450) from 5th, 6th, and 7th grade with a numerical comparison task tapping inhibitory and other processes. Results showed that both general math achievement and accuracy in comparing fractions were significantly predicted by inhibition. The former association, however, turned out to mediate the latter one. Another process, related to visual priming, predicted children’s likelihood to answer fraction comparison items focusing exclusively on the fraction components. This relation was, furthermore, not mediated by general math achievement. Altogether, these findings shed light on the mental processes underlying the early stages of the learning of fractions. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Fraction comparison; Inhibitory control; Mathematics achievement; Natural number bias; Numerical Stroop task; Visual priming",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: FB0003","The authors are grateful to the administrators, teachers, parents, and children of the school network who took part in this study, to Benjamín Bossi and Sergio Orellana for their assistance in collecting the data, and to anonymous reviewers who made invaluable contributions to this manuscript.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents the traditional method commonly used in computer graphic stereoscopic vision (implemented in C language) and the proposed method (implemented in GeoGebra software). The proposed method is a new methodology for stereo spatial visualization. It uses the orthogonal axonometric perspective obtained from the mongean projections of the object, both concepts studied in Descriptive Geometry course. Findings – The use of stereoscopic techniques has great potential for the improvement of spatial visualization ability, because they allow the understanding of spatial situations presented in complex exercises. The students who tested the proposed method said that it offered a superior stereo vision depth in relation to the traditional matrix method. Research limitations/implications – For future work, the paper suggests to carry out a statistical study to evaluate the educational benefit of the tool, and to investigate the proposed method using the conical axonometric perspective. Practical implications – Create a virtual environment to support the process of teaching/learning Descriptive Geometry and contribute to the development of students' spatial visualization skills. The software will be available on the Internet, in the GeoGebra libraries. The objective is to increase e-learning, where a greater number of students will study. Social implications – The current goal in Brazil universities is to greatly increase the number of poor students entering as a social inclusion strategy. University courses need more efficient teaching techniques to attend the students, so the e-learning techniques are recommended. Originality/value – This paper’s innovative characteristic comes from the implementation of stereoscopic vision from traditional methods used in Descriptive Geometry, so the proposed method improves both the visualization ability and the Descriptive Geometry basic concepts, which points out to its educational role. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer software; E-Learning; Mathematics; Research; Students; Undergraduates",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942013939

Previous studies indicate no available statistics on the proportion of pharmacies that provide cognitive services in Brazil. Furthermore, few studies have explored CPs' performance regarding patient-centred cognitive services in community pharmacies. Thus, quality improvement initiatives are needed for the responsible provision of self-medication to fully integrate Brazilian CPs into patient-centred cognitive services. Consequently, the present study's aim was to assess CPs' performance in the management of cases with minor symptoms using nonprescription medicines. © 2015 by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare.","Community pharmacist; Minor illness; Nonprescription medicines; Pharmacist's intervention","non prescription drug; Brazil; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; human; interpersonal communication; multicenter study; patient care; patient education; pharmacist; pilot study; standards; teaching; Brazil; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Nonprescription Drugs; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Simulation; Patient-Centered Care; Pharmacists; Pilot Projects",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939537068

However, as sustainability is a complex subject, methodological proposals on the topic must avoid making disjointed analyses which focus exclusively on curricula or on organisational strategy, as often seen in the literature. Accordingly, the aim of this article was to propose a complex matrix for the analysis of sustainable transformative learning (CMASTL). This model integrates the change processes for sustainability and the management and teaching–learning processes, presenting different levels of sustainability inclusion in educational institutions. The basis of the CMASTL is a complex framework comparing different ways of understanding individuals and organisations that influence how sustainability is defined and the measures necessary for it to be achieved. The framework presents key concepts which informed the development of the CMASTL. In constructing the matrix, a number of articles from international periodicals proposing different sustainability evaluation tools for use in teaching institutions were consulted. The aim of the CMASTL was thus to both integrate and complement existing methodological proposals. As well as adding value to academic discussions, the CMASTL can be used as a guide for courses and universities seeking to implement positive changes for sustainable learning. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","assessment; complex matrix; sustainability; transformative learning",,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","Lisiane Celia Palma is a lecturer and researcher at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS), in the city of Canoas, Brazil; she is a PhD candidate to the Post Graduate Program in Management (PPGA) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and a researcher member of the Technological Innovation and Education Group at the IFRS and at the Organizations Study Group (GESTOR) at UFRGS, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil.

Learning performance factors evaluated included students' learning behavior while interacting with the system, AR-SaBEr's learning effectiveness, and students' motivation in using the AR-based simulation environment. The study suggests that AR simulators can be exploited as effective learning environments for learning the basic principles of electricity.

We seek to ascertain the veracity of these reports associated with its mathematical productions and review the context in which they were published, including their repercussions and the results of recent studies. French contributions of the nineteenth century, including the late eighteenth century, were instrumental in the development of mathematics. The notion of rigor in mathematics was going through profound changes. The classical paradigms were faced with new conceptions emerging from the analytical method. The dissemination and application of the analytical method in geometry, mechanics, and infinitesimal calculus was a crucial step to elaborate many mathematical practices we have today. The mathematical analysis was slowly approaching the form it has developed nowadays. There is a very strong connection in the history of mathematics between the changes that happened during the late XVIII / beginning XIX century and the contributions of the French school. Our goal is to contrast some of the widespread myths about the school with the results established by the new historiography. New research on the history of the École Polytechnique (abbreviated as EP), particularly since the Bicentennial of the French Revolution, have revealed new sources in archives, with new methodologies. By supplementing the more recent investigations, we use the Journal de l'École Polytechnique in its first years, to seek publications directly from the school providing evidence for our claims.","History of Mathematics Education; Laplace; Monge; Relation between Teaching and Research; École Polytechnique",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941364562

Since the days of Plato, there have been essentially two different answers to this question. To Plato mathematics was a science of the unity and order of this universe. Since Galilei people came to believe that mathematics does not describe the objective world, it is not a reflection of some metaphysical realism. It is rather a reflection of human activity in this world. Kant, by his ""Copernican Revolution of Epistemology"" seems to have been the first to realize this. For example, number, or more generally arithmetic, was to the Pythagoreans ""a cosmology"" (KLEIN, 1985, p. 45), to Dedekind it is a means to better distinguish between things.

Enhancing the quality of emergency obstetric and neonatal care is one important strategy to decrease mortality. An innovative, low-tech, simulation-based team training program (PRONTO) aims to optimize care provided during obstetric and neonatal emergencies in low-resource settings. Methods: We conducted PRONTO simulation training between July 2012 and December 2012 in 15 clinics in Alta Verapaz, Huehuetenango, San Marcos, and Quiche, Guatemala. These clinics received PRONTO as part of a larger pair-matched cluster randomized trial of a comprehensive intervention package. Training participants were obstetric and neonatal care providers that completed pre-and post-training assessments for the two PRONTO training modules, which evaluated knowledge of evidence-based practice and self-efficacy in obstetric and neonatal topics. Part of the training included a session for trained teams to establish strategic goals to improve clinical practice. We utilized a pre/post-test design to evaluate the impact of the course on both knowledge and self-efficacy with longitudinal fixed effects linear regression with robust standard errors. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between knowledge and self-efficacy. Poisson regression was used to assess the association between the number of goals achieved and knowledge, self-efficacy, and identified facility-level factors. Results: Knowledge and self-efficacy scores improved significantly in all areas of teaching. Scores were correlated for all topics overall at training completion. More than 60 % of goals set to improve clinic functioning and emergency care were achieved. No predictors of goal achievement were identified. Conclusions: PRONTO training is effective at improving provider knowledge and self-efficacy in training areas. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of the training on provider use of evidence-based practices and on maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

Objectives: to describe the formative strategy of PhD in health sciences aimed at the ENSAP professors and to show some of the results in 2013. Methods: a cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted with the total number of professors. The heads of the teaching departments were asked to answer a questionnaire that would explore the situation of each educator in the process of doctoral formation and discussion groups were formed to identify the actions that the departments had carried out. Results: over 30 % of professors were Doctors of Philosophy in Health Sciences. Fifty nine of those who had not achieved this category, were involved in some of the stages of the formation process. Eight of the eleven teaching departments had professors who were registered in the PhD formation program. There were some departments in which the rate of doctors were high whereas others exhibited lower rates, but some of their staff members had already started the PhD studies. Conclusions: it was found that the systematic control of this strategy was in place, which has contributed to significantly increase the number of professors attaining the scientific degree and to encourage those who are not to be involved in the process. All these aspects are part of the work plans of the professors and are also taken into account for their individual evaluation. © 2015, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

We developed activities using algebraic, graphic and natural language registers (Duval, 1995, 2000) in order to engage teachers in the solution treatment within different registers and in conversions between them so they might become aware of the errors they make when using algebraic methods in the light of comparisons with graphical methods. Analyses of teachers’ protocols were undertaken to identify formal, intuitive and algorithmic aspects (Fischbein, 1993). Our findings showed that teachers did not search for mathematical reasons as why their algebraic and graphical strategies resulted in different solutions, suggesting that they had not fully appropriated the formal aspects of the algebraic solving methods they normally use to solve inequations. © 2015, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

Responding to a call for comprehensive research on remediation of student professionalism lapses, the authors explored current medical school policies and practices. Method In 2012-2013, key administrators at U.S. and Canadian medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education were interviewed via telephone or e-mail. The structured interview questionnaire contained open-ended and closed questions about practices for monitoring student professionalism, strategies for remediating lapses, and strengths and limitations of current systems. The authors employed a mixed-methods approach, using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis based on grounded theory. Results Ninety-three (60.8%) of 153 eligible schools participated. Most (74/93; 79.6%) had specific policies and processes regarding professionalism lapses. Student affairs deans and course/clerkship directors were typically responsible for remediation oversight. Approaches for identifying lapses included incident-based reporting and routine student evaluations. The most common remediation strategies reported by schools that had remediated lapses were mandated mental health evaluation (74/90; 82.2%), remediation assignments (66/90; 73.3%), and professionalism mentoring (66/90; 73.3%). System strengths included catching minor offenses early, emphasizing professionalism schoolwide, focusing on helping rather than punishing students, and assuring transparency and good communication. System weaknesses included reluctance to report (by students and faculty), lack of faculty training, unclear policies, and ineffective remediation. In addition, considerable variability in feedforward processes existed between schools. Conclusions The identified strengths can be used in developing best practices until studies of the strategies' effectiveness are conducted.",,"Canada; education; human; interview; medical education; medical school; medical student; procedures; professionalism; psychology; questionnaire; standards; statistics and numerical data; teacher; teaching; United States; Canada; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Mentors; Professionalism; Remedial Teaching; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943634243

The need of continuous and lifelong training is an issue that has prevailed since the last century (European Commission, 1995; European Council, 1975; Delors, 1996; Marsick & Watkins, 1990). In this regard, we obverse changes in the ways of learning highlighting those that take place outside formal educational and training institution and that do not depend directly on the trainer or structured processes. METHOD. This paper starts from the results obtained in the Adult Education Survey (EADA, by its Spanish acronym). Specifically, the collection method is a computer-assisted personal interview, through stratified random sampling, of 153 items to 17,829 Spanish persons. In this sense, it has a twofold aim (1) to analyze if there are gender differences in non-formal and informal activities carried out; and, if so, (2) to identify the variables associated with these differences. Therefore, we use descriptive and inferential statistics of the most important variables. RESULTS. The outcomes indicate significant differences between male and female sexes in regards to age, nationality and social class for taking part in non-formal and informal learning activities. DISCUSSION. Finally, we point out the limitations of these variables in women's professional development, and we make proposals for progressing in the elimination of these differences. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Adults; Gender differences; Lifelong learning; National surveys",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960942216

From direct observations, interviews, questionnaires and study of events it was possible to identify some arguments that teachers have in order to promote verbal-stated problems as the main way to do mathematical modeling. These results suggest the need to develop strategies that enable an empowerment of teachers on modeling, which transcend the stereotyped verbal-statements towards more realistic situations that involve aspects of daily life and culture in school mathematics.","Mathematical model; Modeling; Secondary teacher development",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954309784

In the literature, such variables are approached independently of each other, which makes it difficult to glean a full understanding of the issue. This study aimed to correlate and predict these variables: teacher working conditions, burnout indicators, educational practices of teachers, student repertoire of social skills and behavior. Ninety four regular education teachers, responsible for classes with students with disabilities or resource classroom who attended an improvement course participated in this study. Data was collected by applying: 1) a Questionnaire about teacher perceptions of the teaching profession; 2) the Maslach Burnout Inventory - MBI; 3) a Questionnaire of Educational Social Skills for Teachers; and 4) a Pro-social Behavior Inventory. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation), correlation (Spearman test) and linear regression analysis. Results indicated that negative practices influence the level of burnout of teachers, which, in turn, is influenced by working conditions, affecting the emotional health of teachers. The conclusion pointed to the importance of multiple measures to assess work and health of teachers, as well as the need for intervention promoting better working conditions and educational practices. © 2015, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

The gains (or their absence), in the Saeb test, for the 1999-2013 period, are also higher in mathematics than in Portuguese. Part of the gains in the Pisa math test and most of those in the reading test result from the gradual increase in the number of years fifteen year-old students spend in school.

Different platforms include various activity modules, within which collaborative learning communities are built, file sharing and grade handling are facilitated, and navigation log statistics are provided. These logs shed light on the daily use of the platform. The resulting information creates an overview of users’ online navigation characteristics and preferences. Through the analysis of these navigation logs, relevant information can be extracted that may help in understanding the teaching-learning processes within VLEs. In this study, the navigation logs of students enrolled in a course offered at a School of Engineering were analyzed. The objective of this project was to analyze the characteristics of the students’ navigation by identifying, summarizing and characterizing the way in which they interact with the platform.

Most of this chemistry research has examined these variables by identifying dyadic relationships through bivariate correlations. The main purpose of this study was to simultaneously investigate students' perceptions of teacher-student interactions (autonomy support), motivation (expectancy, importance, utility and interest), metacognitive strategies for problem solving (planning, monitoring and evaluation), and performance in chemistry. Measures were collected from 503 Spanish undergraduates (53.13% females) aged 18 to 36 years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested the hypothesized direct and mediated relations between these variables. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provided evidence of the robustness of the evaluation instruments. Second, perceived autonomy support positively predicted expectancy, importance, utility, interest, planning, monitoring, evaluation and performance in chemistry; motivational variables positively predicted metacognitive strategies and performance; and metacognitive strategies positively predicted performance. Moreover, all hypothesized mediated effects between variables were also supported.

The tool is able to identify errors of different types: (1) epistemological, in which the law is incorrectly presented as data correlation instead of as a pattern of causality; (2) semantic, in which natural law is presented as a mathematical statement that relates variables but with an absence of ambiguous material reference; (3) deterministic, in which the relationship of natural variables is presented but with no causality statement; and (4) mechanistic, in which a causality statement is presented with the absence of an explanatory mechanism. In this work, Boyle's law was used as an example of the applicability of the instrument. In this case, we found errors in most of the university textbooks that we analyzed. Most of the errors arose from the disconnection between the symbolic and microscopic levels. The presentations of Boyle's law in general chemistry are given in textbooks that include illustrations based in a macroscopic perspective, in which the macroscopic compression mechanism is completely disconnected from the microscopic collision mechanism.

Few participants (4%) identified barriers implicating a sense of shared school-university responsibility for the success of the practicum. About a third of the barriers identified pertain to within school factors, such as teachers' and parents' reluctance to host candidates. From these administrator's perspectives, a distance with the host school is produced through a number of factors attributed to the universities' curricula and management. Administrators manage this distance to leverage better learning opportunities for their school's pupils, for prospective teachers, and for the school staff.

It arises from a line of research at the University Pablo de Olavide (Seville) and developed at the Laboratory for Computational Intelligence (LCI). EduTool® is developed under the auspices of the UNE 66181 standard, while at the LCI, the significance of the sub-factors for each of the dimensions (recognition of training, learning methodology and levels of accessibility) of this standard for Quality Management of Virtual Training for MOOC have been analyzed using fuzzy logic. In this sense, aggregation of the linguistic variables of 10 experts was performed using the probabilistic OR function and they were defuzzyfied using the centroid method to calculate these weights. To measure the quality of the courses, we proceded to find and select relevant MOOC platforms: Udacity, EDX, MiríadaX and Coursera. Subsequently, the most relevant MOOCs related to computers and computer science categories were selected by intentional non-probability sampling. For this data collection method, two engineers accessed these MOOC platforms to code and assessing the quality of these courses using EduTool®. In general, the analytical and graphic results show that the quality of the average MOOCs analyzed in each platform is located above the score that describes the required minimum (50 %). In this sense, a higher average quality was appreciated in Coursera (66.34 %) and EDX platform (62.62 %), intermediate in the Udacity platform (54.92 %) and somewhat lower in the MiríadaX platform (50.40 %). © 2015, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

Given that dozens of countries across the world are purchasing computers for their students, we ask which elements are necessary to improve learning when introducing digital resources into the classroom. Understood the orchestration as the coordination of conventional and digital resources, we examine whether effective resource orchestration improves student learning. To do so, an 8-month study was undertaken across 17 schools in Uruguay, involving 544 fourth grade students. A treatment group worked under an orchestrated strategy, while a control group followed the national strategy, which includes the One Laptop per Child Computer (XO). Our study confirmed that the national strategy alone is capable of producing significant progress in student learning. However, we also found that the orchestration produces a statistically significant improvement in the results when compared to the control group. The main finding indicates that when teachers have an orchestrated strategy to integrate digital and non-digital resources, student learning is enhanced in relation to the curricular objectives. Finally, we discovered that learning is improved in the treatment group when there is systematic use of resources, and when the school's infrastructure facilitates the use of the technology. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Determinants of effectiveness; Resource integration; Resource orchestration; Teachers' work in the classroom; Teaching mathematics; XO computer",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928209004

This quality is commonly assured by the accreditation of engineering programs and the certification, licensure, and registration of graduates. A high-quality engineering program should be concerned with the quality of education of its graduates. This paper presents an analytical method for understanding the cumulative effects of competence acquisition in courses on the quality of engineering programs, thus allowing quality enhancement from a global perspective of the program. The proposed method was developed from a model established through the theory of Markov chains, considering the cumulative effects of acquisition of competencies over the semesters on the quality of engineering graduates. In the proposed model, the quality of engineering graduates is represented by discrete levels, numbered from 1 to 5, representing the worst to the best quality, respectively. This paper does not answer the question of how to achieve the desired quality or what learning methods could be used; however, the method can predict the quality of engineering education in a program and provide information to allow the faculty an opportunity to adjust their teaching during the program. The model explains how the heterogeneity of learning affects the average quality of engineering graduates. Understanding this process is critical to proactive quality management in engineering undergraduate programs. © 2015 The Author(s).","Engineering education; quality assurance; self assessment","Engineering education; Markov chains; Quality assurance; Cumulative effects; Engineering graduates; Engineering program; Engineering undergraduates; Global perspective; Quality enhancement; Quality of education; Self assessment; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931041514

For indigenous populations, language shift (the gradual replacement of one language by another) is a factor that can increase this heterogeneity and poses an additional challenge for valid testing. We investigated whether and how indigenous populations can be validly included in a large-scale assessment program. We gave Mexican preschool Mayan students aged 5 to 6 years the same set of mathematics items in three versions: (1) original in Spanish, (2) Mayan translation, and (3) content equivalent, developed from scratch in Mayan. Also, we collected information on the students’ and the teachers’ use of Spanish and Mayan, and on the communities’ support of the two languages. Students performed poorly on the three versions. Generalizability theory-based analyses revealed considerable performance inconsistency across items and language versions and low generalizability and dependability coefficients. This performance instability appears to stem from a dwindling support of the Mayan language in Mayan schools and communities. Fair, valid assessment of indigenous populations in either their languages or their countries’ dominant languages appears to be difficult to accomplish with current testing models and policies. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","fairness; indigenous populations; language shift; large-scale assessment; linguistic minorities; validity",,"University of California, UC","This investigation was funded by the National Institute for Educational Evaluation (Mexico) through a contract with the University of Baja California.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929287099

Given the inherent dialogical nature of formative assessment in the classroom, video can provide a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing teachers' formative assessment interactions with students. In this study, we provide a framework for examining expertise in formative assessment and use this framework to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the practices of 13 mathematics and science teachers. While we only saw a few instances of true expertise in formative assessment practices in our examination of videos, our findings indicate that teachers with more expertise in formative assessment let students' ideas guide their teaching. This leads to higher correlations among the dimensions of practice that we articulate in our framework for expert teachers. However, because many of the instructional decisions that teachers make are not visible on video, video alone may not provide enough information to judge expertise in formative assessment. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Formative assessment; Mathematics; Science; Video analysis",,"Michigan Department of Education, MDE","Work on the Formative Assessment for Michigan Educators (FAME) project was supported by the Michigan Department of Education.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939975965

Three groups of students in two different schools in the city of Puebla, Mexico, were followed from the last year of primary school (Year 6) to the second year of their secondary education (Year 8). Learning was characterised as the ongoing structural change that allows individuals or groups to act effectively in a changing environment [Maturana (GAIA, a way of knowing: political implications of the new biology. Lindisfarne, New York, pp 65–82, 1987)]. An enactivist methodology, which revolves around the idea of research being a form of learning [Reid (Proceedings of the 20th conference of the international group for the psychology of mathematics education. PME, Valencia, pp 203–209, 1996)], implied that, as I carried out the study, what I was doing was learning about how people learn algebra. My initial questions arose from my experiences with the teaching and learning of mathematics, which gave me a sense of the complexity involved in the learning processes. Later, as I became immersed in the process of investigation of the teaching and learning of algebra, my conceptions continually evolved. The meaning of the phrase ‘algebraic learning’, which I used as a way of maintaining a wide perspective that allowed me to explore the events in the classroom in a complex way, arose as I engaged with enactivist ideas about learning, with the research literature on the learning of algebra, in conversations with people and in interactions with the participants of my project. I went through a process of continual development and change which I describe in this paper. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Algebraic learning; Enactivism",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939651801

The methodology used in the study was a case study carried out in a Brazilian Federal University which originated from the current policy for the expansion of higher education. In this perspective, the Federal University of Tocantins (UFT) was selected as the object of study, due to the fact that it is located in one of the central regions aimed by the expansion policy; it is the institution which has shown the highest growth in the number of teachers and courses among the Federal universities in the Northern Region of the country and it has several campuses (seven in total). The study was carried out during the second half of 2012, when 130 QWL evaluation questionnaires (10-point Likert-type scale) were applied. The SPSS software was used for the treatment of closed questions and the NVivo 10 software for open questions. Finally, the data obtained from the questionnaires were cross-referenced with illness data obtained from SIASS/UFT. The results show that the greater the integration of the professor’s life project with the institution, the greater the QWL, even in unfavorable working conditions. On the other hand, the greater the distance of the personal/collective project from the institutional objectives, the lower the QWL. Relational factors have direct implications on the QWL of teachers and the adoption of Policies for Promotion and Support for the permanence of teachers contributes to the reduction of illnesses. © 2015, Centro de Estudos Educacao e Sociedade - CEDES.

The first term is based on the contributions of Bakhtin and the second on Vigotski's contributions. The first term is advocated as the process in which knowledge is produced from a dialogical perspective; the second is defended as the result of problematization of the current discourse. To this end, we used an argumentative model of predominantly analytical nature. The target content of the speech consisted of a fragment on elementary algebra in the classroom.

A total of 149 low-income preschoolers (almost all 3- and 4-year-olds) participated, attending six experimental and seven control classrooms. The STSA was introduced in the experimental classrooms for the entire school year, and all children in both conditions were pre- and post-tested on 11 measures of narrative, vocabulary, emergent literacy, pretend abilities, peer play cooperation, and self-regulation. Participation in the STSA was associated with improvements in narrative comprehension, print and word awareness, pretend abilities, self-regulation, and reduced play disruption. For almost all these measures, positive results were further strengthened by the frequency of participation in storytelling by individual children, indicated by number of stories told (NOST). The STSA is a structured preschool practice that exemplifies child-centered, play-based, and constructivist approaches in early childhood education, and that can operate as a curriculum module in conjunction with a variety of different preschool curricula.

The Mexican government has been engaging in a policy of HE quality improvement that can be traced to 1989. In this paper we use data from the period 2007–2010, when the various quality programmes were in action, in order to see if, on the basis of public information, it is possible to trace their impact on Federal, State, and Private Universities in Mexico. The technical approach is based on Multivariate Statistical Analysis, particularly in Ordinal Multidimensional Scaling. It was found that, during the period studied, the performance indicators used in this study show a general quality improvement in Mexican HE, and that this improvement has extended to both the State and the Private sectors.

The main contribution of this study resides in the interdisciplinary development of the intervention, made in close collaboration between educational researchers, and researchers in cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology. The intervention was implemented by teachers through class activities, to promote executive functions and academic achievement. These activities were articulated into the current kindergarten curriculum and, at the same time, built upon concepts and methodologies of developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience for executive functions training. Results showed: (1) non-significant differences between groups in cognitive performance from pre- to post-training assessment, and (2) significant differences in academic achievement for Language, Mathematics, Autonomy, and Contact with peers in first grade. Our study sets a precedent for future interdisciplinary work bridging the gap between developmental psychology and education, which we believe will prove key to improving academic success. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Academic achievement; Cognitive neuroscience; Developmental psychology; Education; Executive functions; Intervention","academic achievement; Article; child; Child Behavior Questionnaire; cognition; cognitive assessment; cognitive neuroscience; comparative study; contact with peer; controlled study; curriculum development; demography; developmental psychology; education; education program; executive function; female; follow up; human; kindergarten; language; longitudinal study; male; mathematics; neurologic examination; neuroscience; personal autonomy; poverty; preschool child; priority journal; quasi experimental study; questionnaire; reaction time; sample size; social interaction; social status; study design","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT: 36393, 38202, PICT-2005","Study supported by Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (FONCYT) (Grants: PICT-2005 No. 38202 and PICTO No. 36393 ), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) , Centro de Educación Médica e Investigación Clínica “Norberto Quirno” (CEMIC) .

Although reforms toward constructivist and inquiry-based teaching in science instruction have been made in each of the three reviewed countries, each country demonstrates limitations in the implementation of teacher education that aims at those objectives. None of these countries have rigorous selection criteria for candidates for science teacher education programs, although each has some type of certification or test requirement before entry into the public education system is permitted. The three countries have similar teacher training programs, with instruction programs lasting between 4 and 5 years; programs entail both disciplinary instruction and pedagogical instruction that starts in the first year. Data from the three countries show that a high percentage of instruction in the training programs is devoted to general pedagogy with less instruction time devoted to specific preparation for teaching science. Disciplinary instruction accounts for nearly 50 % of the instruction program among secondary teachers. Training in other subjects such as nature of science, history of science and scientific inquiry is poorly developed. In general, there are few opportunities for research on practicum, as these opportunities tend to occur at the end of the training program. The generation of instruction standards by governments as well as the increase in the number of scholars dedicated to the investigation of science education and the education of science teachers suggests that some of these shortcomings could be remedied in the future. © 2015, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.","Pedagogical content knowledge; Practicum; Science methods courses; Science teacher education; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019830440

Chile is not an exception in this global trend. Although Chile has significantly expanded early education coverage for children from low-income backgrounds, there has been little research to assess the effects these programs have had in improving academic outcomes. Responding to this need, this study assesses the impact of Chile's public early childhood education programs on fourth-grade academic achievement (as measured by the country's national Education Quality Measurement System, SIMCE). Our results indicate that, after controlling for socio-demographic factors potentially associated with choosing to participate in an ECCE program or not, ECCE is positively associated with academic gains on all three SIMCE tests: mathematics, reading, and social sciences. Chilean children who participated in public ECCE programs scored on average 0.23 Standard Deviations (SD) higher in math, 0.19 SD higher in reading, and 0.19 SD higher in social sciences than children who did not attend an ECCE program before entering Kindergarten. However, our findings suggest that not all children benefit equally from attending ECCE. Results show that boys benefit academically significantly more than girls, and that the ECCE effect on academic achievement also differs depending on the Socioeconomic Status (SES) of the families, with children from middle-low SES groups benefiting the most. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Academic outcomes; Early childhood education; Gender; Program effect; SES",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939800562

Evaluation addressed topic mastery and opinions about the topic and the manner in which it was taught. While further research is required before definite conclusions are warranted, results relating to topic mastery provide grounds for optimism about the epiSTEMe approach.

Our research focused on studying the extent to which the planned, systematic use of educational videogames can result in the generation of learning contexts conducive to developing Multiple Intelligences (MIs) amongst schoolchildren. Methodology. A twofold methodological approach was adopted: a) qualitative: previous assessment and analysis of the videogame to be utilized in the experience, giving priority to its suitability and correspondence with primary education curricular areas; b) experimental: case study oriented to verifying the possible increase of MIs amongst pupils enrolled in the First Cycle of Primary Education (N=101) derived from implementing the videogame in the classroom during one academic year, using a control group and identifying the level reached before (test) and after the experience (post-test) with an assessment instrument. Results. The previous selection of a videogame guarantees the acquisition and reinforcement of numerous learning formats linked to specific Primary Education curricular contents. The fun activities –related to all eight intelligences– imply motivating challenges for schoolchildren as well as chances to boost various skills. A widespread increase of all intelligences was observed after the playful-formative experience with the videogame; this became particularly significant in the cases of logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence –the first two improving to a greater extent in girls than in boys. Conclusions: The starting hypothesis was verified: the introduction of suitable videogames in the classroom and their systematic exploitation promotes MI development amongst primary education children. In particular, measuring operations, mathematical calculations, counts, shape and size identification and classification, relationships and correspondences, etc., presented in an entertaining way by means of animations, graphics and drawings, together with the activities that promote body care (healthy diet and personal hygiene), facilitate learning and improve MIs. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental","Cognitive and emotional learning; Motivation; Multiple intelligences; Skills; Videogames",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121778532

This article puts forth the current state of knowledge about advising a Doctoral thesis. Academic literature has conceptualized this process as an educational practice in which the advisor assumes an active role in fostering the graduate student’s learning. This conceptualization allows us to assess which teaching strategies are effective and to consider learning about research to be the result of the advisorstudent interaction and not only to stem from the student’s competencies. © 2015.

It is based on an ethnomathematics perspective drawn from Wittgenstein's later work and Michel Foucault's thinking. Data comprised PEA teachers’ and students’ documents, MST guideline documents and reports about mathematics education projects developed in MST schools. Its analytical strategy considers the new configurations of what was formerly called rural and urban spaces, in countries like Brazil. Based on this, the article examines the relationship between peasants’ knowledge and school mathematics in those two projects. We show that taking peasant language games into account was important for both. However, for PEA, this was the point of departure while these were taught at schools as part of their struggles for MST. Thus, we argued that the two different educational projects for multigrade peasant schools in rural Brazil (connected to different projects of society) were in dispute: the first was aligned with neoliberal hegemonic logic while the second was attuned to the struggles of MST in opposition with World Bank guidelines. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).

The case is based on data collected by one of the authors in Argentina. The case is appropriate for senior-level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students. Case synopsis: Mr. Anibal Gervasoni is the newly-appointed product manager of the Scientific Gases unit of Indura Argentina, the Argentine subsidiary of Indura S.A. Indura S.A. is a Chilean company; however, in 2012 Air Products, Inc. (a multinational company headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.A) purchased a controlling interest in Indura S.A. At the time it was purchased (that is, in 2012) Indura S.A. was the largest independent industrial gases company in South America. While the Scientific Gases unit of Indura Argentina sells a variety of gases (acetylene, pure and liquid helium ,argon, hydrogen, nitrogen, specialty mixed gases, etc.) throughout Argentina, over the last couple of years, the total revenues of the unit have grown very slowly. Based on the recent history of slow growth, the top management of Indura S.A. has taken the position that no additional capital should be invested in Indura Argentina's Scientific Gases unit. Gervasoni, however, suspects that there is enormous potential for the Scientific Gases unit of Indura Argentina; more precisely, he suspects that the Specialty Gases unit should be able (if additional efforts and investments are made) to dramatically increase its 2014 revenues by the year 2018. Last week Gervasoni received an invitation to come to Air Products, Inc. headquarters in Pennsylvania to present to Air Products senior management his analysis of the opportunities available to Indura Argentina's Scientific Gases unit. To assist him in identifying and describing specific opportunities available to the unit, Gervasoni has invited Prof. Carlos Aimar (a business school professor at the University of San Isidro, in Buenos Aires) to develop (within the next 30 days) a set of suggestions as to how the 2013 revenues of $1,000,000 could be dramatically increased by the year 2018. Information provided in this case study includes: 1. Regarding Argentina: Historical overview, a sample of recent demographic statistics from the World Bank, (and for benchmarking purposes, comparable statistics for the United States), plus information on the economy of Argentina. 2. Regarding the company: Business model, current marketing strategy, current performance, and numerous factors impacting that performance. 3. Additional information: Information on customers, information about the competition and competitors, and information about the scientific gas industry in Argentina.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962512430

The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of the use of CAS and DGS in higher education.

Based on Piaget's and Bruner's cognitive theories, we suggest the use of apps which could be employed to improve the comprehension of selected mathematical topics, to allow students to acquire the mathematical competencies to better understand the concepts involved in them, as well as to promote the development of variational thinking. © 2015 Research Information Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958967566

In the third case study, students were given an objective-model an elevator's movement-and general guidelines on how to approach the modelling of a real life situation. Results show that when students were given an initial model, their focus was on the given model and their solutions emulated the form of the initial model.

Our research focused on studying the extent to which the planned, systematic use of educational videogames can result in the generation of learning contexts conducive to developing Multiple Intelligences (MIs) amongst schoolchildren. Methodology. A twofold methodological approach was adopted: a) qualitative: previous assessment and analysis of the videogame to be utilized in the experience, giving priority to its suitability and correspondence with primary education curricular areas; b) experimental: case study oriented to verifying the possible increase of MIs amongst pupils enrolled in the First Cycle of Primary Education (N=101) derived from implementing the videogame in the classroom during one academic year, using a control group and identifying the level reached before (test) and after the experience (post-test) with an assessment instrument. Results. The previous selection of a videogame guarantees the acquisition and reinforcement of numerous learning formats linked to specific Primary Education curricular contents. The fun activities -related to all eight intelligences- imply motivating challenges for schoolchildren as well as chances to boost various skills. A widespread increase of all intelligences was observed after the playful-formative experience with the videogame; this became particularly significant in the cases of logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence -the first two improving to a greater extent in girls than in boys. Conclusions: The starting hypothesis was verified: the introduction of suitable videogames in the classroom and their systematic exploitation promotes MI development amongst primary education children. In particular, measuring operations, mathematical calculations, counts, shape and size identification and classification, relationships and correspondences, etc., presented in an entertaining way by means of animations, graphics and drawings, together with the activities that promote body care (healthy diet and personal hygiene), facilitate learning and improve MIs. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Cognitive and emotional learning; Motivation; Multiple intelligences; Skills; Videogames",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958162129

One of the most distinctive features of digital texts is their internal connections via hy-perlinks, resulting in non-linear hypertexts. Hypertext structure and previous knowledge af-fect navigation and comprehension of digital expository texts. From the Cognitive Load framework, working memory capacity would have a role in supporting decisions about navi-gation, and in situation model construction for comprehension. The present study assessed text structure, previous domain knowledge, and working memory capacity effects on compre-hension and navigation of digital expository texts. Method: Fifty-six participants completed a working memory capacity measure, read four dig-ital texts and answered questions about them. Hyperext structure (hierarchical vs. network) and previous thematic knowledge (high vs. low) were manipulated in a within-subjects de-sign. Navigation behavior was indexed taking into account total time spent on each text, total number of pages per text, number of returns to the initial page, and number of nonlinear links clicked. Results: High previous knowledge, and high working memory capacity, led to better compre-hension. Participants who read under network interfaces followed less structured navigation paths than those who read hierarchically organized interfaces. On the other hand, high previ-ous knowledge texts led to more pages visited, more non-linear jumps in reading, and more returns to the overview in the Home page in the network condition. Also, total time spent on each text was longer for high working memory participants reading high previous knowledge texts. Discussion: Overall, this pattern of results adds to the literature about the beneficial effects promoted by hierarchical interfaces and concept maps; and the disorientation effects network hypertexts have for low domain knowledge students. On the other hand, given good previous knowledge and high working memory, a more variable pattern of navigation would help read-ers engage in more active reading processes. © 2015 Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Comprehension; Digital text; Navigation; Working memory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952760720

Thus, the purpose of this article was to describe the use of a sequence with four short videos to teach introductory concepts of semiconductors at high-school level. These videos were shown to two classes of third grade of high school, with a total of 72 students. After each video, we gave the students a questionnaire with 16 Likert items, in order to measure the students' attitudes regarding some concepts discussed in the videos. Analyzing the questionnaire results, we saw the effectiveness of the proposal, mainly with respect to the students motivation to study this subject. The majority of concepts were well assimilated, and the few difficulties were in agreement with literature. This suggests that the use of short videos is a strategy that can be more used, mainly due its versatility and very limited need of technical resources. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Audiovisual resources; Semiconductors; Videos for teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949679504

In this paper, we report an experience of five consecutive semesters (from 2011/2 to 2013/2) in which an Astronomy course for undergraduate students of Physics at UFRGS was delivered via distance education. We describe the teaching material that was developed and implemented on the Moodle platform. Learning was assessed by online activities and face-to-face exams. Considering the overall results after five semesters, we found that: passing rates among students showed a small improvement compared to the results of the previous five semesters, when the course was offered only in the face-to-face classroom mode; demand for evening classes (delivered through distance education) increased slightly; and dropout rates did not change significantly. Interactivity among students in the virtual environment was below expectations. We conclude that the quality of distance teaching and learning is the same as in the face-to-face mode, and that, for some students, distance education can be more effective than traditional methods. Nevertheless, improvements are necessary in order to reach a larger number of students. © Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Astronomy; Courseware; Distance learning; Higher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949676479

The study is characterized as analytic-descriptive and was based on primary sources; they included technical reports and data from the Brazilian Higher Education Census Bureau from 2000 to 2011, as well as documents from the country's accessibility program known as Include (Incluir, in original Portuguese) from 2005 to 2011. The decade in question was selected in line with understanding the federal government's measures planned in the country's National Education Plan, which were focused on increasing enrollment in Brazilian higher education programs. The need to question the results of the aforementioned measures also justified the choice of the period to be studied. The data analysis revealed an increase in the number of disabled students enrolled in traditional and online undergraduate degree programs (particularly at Brazilian public universities) following the initiation of the Include Program. Overall, enrollments among disabled students in higher education programs increased in terms of numbers; however, the percentage still represents only a small part of the disabled population.","Educational indicators; Higher education; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948745820

Hence, learning a manipulative task is generally more effective when watching animations that show natural motions of the task, rather than equivalent static pictures. The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found.

A key factor of collaborative learning that may affect learner outcomes is whether the collaborative groups are assigned project topics randomly or based on a shared interest in the topic. This is a particularly important question for adults, whose performance can depend strongly on how closely the project topic relates to their professional goals. In this study involving an on-line course for 103 professionals we divided the learners into two parallel sections that differed in how they would be assigned to groups to perform collaborative tasks on different topics. In one section, learners were assigned randomly into groups and were given task topics randomly as well. In the other section, they were assigned to a group based on whether they shared a common interest in the topic given to that group. We used Social Network Analysis and Content Analysis to assess the level of collaboration in quantitative and qualitative terms (knowledge construction). Both groups showed a low level of knowledge construction and similar levels of centrality degree and learning performance. However, more learners participated in the collaborative tasks if groups had been assigned based on learners' topic preferences. Our findings suggest that forming groups of adult learners based on topic preferences in on-line environments can increase the number of learners that collaborate, but it does not necessarily improve learner performance.","Collaborative learning; Content analysis; eLearning; Learner preference; SNA",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948142779

The selection strategy was non-probabilistic and intentional analyzing items with the higher and lower levels of success. Using a quantitative methodological approach we concluded that the Chilean students have greater difficulties answering items with large problems that have a context, involving more than one variable and presenting information in different formats. Regarding the type of item, the most complex type were open response and complex multiple choice, which are less common in our school system.

Based on the history of the curriculum, the research dialogued especially with the central ideas of Ivor Goodson, understanding the curriculum as a social construct and investigating how and why certain knowledge is (or is not) taught in a particular historical context. It was found that the statistics discipline was considered very important for the education field in the first half of the twentieth century, since it contributed to the production of diagnoses for the planning of public policy, to the work of school inspection and the classification of students. Originating in undergraduate school management courses of Instituto de Educação, Universidade de São Paulo in the 1930s, the statistics discipline gained ground in the pedagogy course, created in 1939, remained in the curriculum, although it underwent several curricular changes. Since the 1980s, it began to suffer limitations in the educational field, due to the focus of educational research, which gradually lost its quantitative nature, or due to the redefining of the pedagogy course, which started advocating for teaching as the basis for the training of pedagogues.","History of education; History of the curriculum; Pedagogy course; Teaching of statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940828409

This fact has helped to compose the picture in schools in which the limitations and contradictions of the Brazilian educational system have appeared. Educational actors and authors are challenged to build knowledge capable of responding to the demands of daily school related to living together and learning in diversity. Since this inclusive process is new to schools, the study aimed to analyze teacher demands in the school inclusion context. The research was qualitative and exploratory, and the participants were six teachers, their students with special educational needs and three professionals in the Nucleus of Inclusive Education from the Municipal Department of Education. Data was collected using the participant observation technique, a field diary, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and the discussion of the data was carried out through analysis of content. The results indicate that there are achievements and contradictions in the reality of schools that assign themselves as inclusive schools; there have been advances and limitations resulting from municipal policies; the model of performance of the group of special education, in the analyzed context, may be revised or expanded; and teachers have demands with regard to public policy, training, and issues to be raised with psychologists. © 2015, Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Educacao Especial.

In it, I report on an evolving model for such training that resulted from a longitudinal case study examining how teacher trainees’ identities, learning and teaching practices changed when exposed to the use of a variety of social networking technologies for language learning in the context of their teacher preparation program. The 12-month classroom-based case study was conducted at a private university in Chile, using a variety of ethnographic tools. I investigated how the integration of certain ICTs into content courses, as opposed to more traditional stand-alone courses on technology use, mattered both in terms of the way the participants viewed themselves as learners and as future teachers of language, as well as of their evolving perspectives on the use of technology for learning and teaching. My aim in conducting the study was twofold: 1) to determine whether innovative technology-infused (TI) courses would serve to enable the beginning teacher participants to shed their traditional, passive, rather narrow cultural mindset as individuals and learners that are contrary to the identities of effective, 21st century teachers; and 2) to see whether opportunities to use a variety of innovative technologies for learning would have an influence on the pedagogies these individuals employed in their teaching practices. While the longitudinal study provided encouraging signs on both accounts within the teacher preparation program, questions remained about whether the model would be supported where it mattered-in ‘real’ classroom teaching. In this article, I report on follow-up qualitative and numbers-based findings that suggest that, generally, the positive changes were not sustained. These findings provide strong support for the need for teacher education models to be tested in ‘real’ practice. Importantly, they also uncover the essential ingredient for promoting future teachers’ uptake of effective use of ICT’s-collective support from all stakeholders within the Teacher Education community © ACPIL.","21st century teacher identity; Community-supported teacher training; ICT in practice teaching; ICT in teacher education; ICT-based teacher education model; Teacher education reform in Chile",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928652388

Objective: to draw up guidelines to write and to evaluate academic reports in nursing students. Methods: for the drafting of guidelines to write and evaluate the academic reports, the following activities were carried out a) literature review, b) analysis of reports written by students c) surveys administered to students, d) semi-structured interview for professors, e) guideline submission and f) validation of the contents of guidelines through expert consultation. Results: the most requested academic reports were literature review, case analysis and letter of opinion. The most common mistakes made by students were related to 11 levels of linguistic analysis. The students were perceived as having little time and many difficulties in writing; they suggested that clear guidelines should be prepared for the report writing, the number of tutorials should be increased and workshops or courses related to writing should be given. As to professors, it was observed that they lacked formal studies in the field of Arts, they took a lot of time to introduce writing in their courses, they lacked common criteria about correction of mistakes and they did not have adequate methodologies to improve writing. Taking the above-mentioned into account, preliminary guidelines were drawn up and then validated by the experts. Conclusions: guidelines for the writing of academic reports should be made on the basis of a text production model including planning, writing and revising.

In this paper, Spanish future primary teachers' pedagogical knowledge of numbers and operations, as revealed through their results in the TEDS-M (Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics), is compared with that of two other groups. The first group are the future primary teachers of other OECD countries that also participated in the study: Norway, Germany, Chile and Poland. The second group are the future primary teachers of participating countries where preservice teachers receive training similar to Spain's teacher training, namely, China-Taipei, Singapore, United States, Philippines and Switzerland. Method. To meet this objective, data was analyzed and parameters were calculated based on categories that characterize the pedagogical knowledge required to correctly answer the questions in this conceptual domain, and using response assessment criteria. Results. We found that Spanish prospective teachers have lower results, in general, than those of the other OECD countries and of countries in the group with similar training programs. The Spanish scores are lower than Norwegian, Swiss and Singaporean scores in all aspects considered. For most categories, Spain obtained higher scores than Philippines and Chile, and similar scores to the U.S.A. Discussion: When comparing the results from the OECD countries that participated in the two international studies, TEDS-M and TIMSS 2011 (Spain, Poland, USA, Norway, Germany and Chile), we find that their relative positions are maintained in the ranking of assessed mathematical knowledge of numbers and operations, whether in preservice teachers or in primary students. Spanish results in the TIMSS are just above Poland and Chile and below the rest. The results obtained in this study may be useful in the current syllabus design process for subjects in the Elementary Teacher Education degree. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).","Mathematics pedagogy; Numbers; Pedagogical content knowledge; Pre-service teacher education; Primary education; TEDS-M",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928341884

Children with attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have an impulsive, rigid and field-dependent cognitive style. This study examines whether selfinstructional cognitive training reduces impulsive cognitive style in children diagnosed with this disorder. Method. The subjetcs were 10 children between the ages of 6 and 8, diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The research design was quasi-experimental with pretest- posttest. The independent variable was the self-instructional cognitive training; the children were grouped into 3 groups by age, and received 30 group sessions. The dependent variable was the impulsive cognitive style which was tested before and after training with the Matching Familiar Figures Test. Results. The pretest-posttest analysis shows a statistically significant reduction in the impulsivity percentile and in number of errors, and a statistically significant increase in latency, after the training.

The research followed different phases. Initially, from a quantitative perspective, the study consisted in a survey to mathematics teachers from the first year of middle school, followed by a purposeful stratified sample in school centers from different contexts and municipalities of the country. Secondly, from a qualitative perspective, the team designed a pedagogical intervention in a group sample of mathematics teachers. Additionally, instances of training and support were instrumented, along with the development of a network of teachers and the design and implementation of innovative curriculum projects using the XOs with students. This article presents the results of the first phase of the investigation, which sought to characterize the math’s teacher population, to understand their teaching practices, their professional development, and their expectations with regards to the Ceibal Plan. The results show significant progress towards universal access to ICT in public education with a strong component of social equity. Notwithstanding, 68% of teachers consider that little or nothing has changed in their teaching practices as a result. One of the main findings is that positive self-perception of ICT innovation is associated with teaching experience and school context. Research shows that there is still significant progress to make in terms of integrating ICT into effective teaching practices. © 2015 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

This article presents an evaluation of the virtual learning object (LO) Incluir - a digital resource designed to support learning. It was created to work as a complementary tool for teacher education that aimed at promoting reflection on inclusion and resignification of teachers' practice. We present some aspects of inclusive education in Brazil and our perspective on teacher education for inclusion. Then we explore the learning object, the pedagogical framework that guided its conception, and the survey that we conducted designed to evaluate the object in its technical and pedagogical aspects. A total of 163 participants answered a questionnaire comprised of 20 closed questions and 3 open-ended questions. Simple descriptive statistics allowed us to determine that participants rated the object very positively. Thematic content analysis was used to organize the qualitative data of the two open-ended questions in three analytical categories. Simple quantification and description was used to analyze the third open-ended question. We concluded that the LO is a valuable complementary resource that contributes to teacher education for inclusion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to investigate and compare the barriers faced by the students with physical disabilities who are being educated in public schools in three different municipalities. The participants were 24 students with physical disabilities, aged from 7 to 16 years, who were enrolled in regular schools of three different municipalities (A, B, and C). For data collection, a set of interviews for the school context written by Scots, translated and adapted to Brazilian reality researchers was used. The results indicated variations in the number and types of barriers, according to the municipalities, and that in general the policies were well evaluated by these students with physical disabilities, considering the 16 indicators analyzed. However, there were notable differences among the three municipalities, and even in the better evaluated municipality, the qualitative analysis of the students reports allowed to identify and exemplify the remaining barriers. The importance is discussed for the school inclusion policy in making the systems responsible to advance removing of all the barriers identified by the students, and not just intervention in those that are more economically viable. © 2015 Oman Medical Specialty Board.

The relation was established using a multivariate model. The results obtained allow us to argue that there is no significant relationship between participating in the assessment of teacher performance and the learning outcomes of students. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze not only the effectiveness of the process but also the official argument of the benefits of teachers undergoing this type of evaluation.

Potential troublesome aspects should be identified in advance such that the learning environment can properly tackle those issues through specialized or innovative ways. In this paper, we highlight the key role of Operations Research (OR) for the modern, high-performing oil industry and describe the in-house implementation of a pioneer, corporate-wide strategic learning program on OR techniques at PETROBRAS, a semi-public Brazilian multinational energy company. The learners were chemical engineers working at the planning/scheduling department of oil refineries, which has a high profile in the organization. Under tutoring, they acquired theoretical knowledge and practical skills concerning the development of optimization models, solution techniques and finished OR-based tools in a community of OR experts, thereby enabling them to rehearse their reflective and computational skills related to day-to-day activities. Most importantly, since aimed to foster the development of self-regulated, reflective learners, this course technically enabled and motivated planners and schedulers to develop further specialization, to rethink inefficient work processes, to change the attitudes and culture in the refinery, to question previous assumptions and operational paradigms. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Mathematical programming; Oil industry; Optimization; Refinery scheduling","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Mathematical programming; Operations research; Optimization; Petroleum refineries; Scheduling; Computational skills; Educational program; Industrial environments; Learning environments; Oil industries; Optimization models; Refinery scheduling; Solution techniques; Petroleum industry",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921516552

With ICT we refer to the convergence of computers, software, audiovisual systems, Internet, telephone, and other equipment that integrates with some of these devices. To this end, several projects were developed, that can be transferred to high schools and colleges settings, with limited financial resources, as is frequent in Latin America. The projects highlight the methodological aspects of science and seek to integrate areas such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, art, etc. They aim to answer the questions: how do we know this?, why do we believe in that? These questions illustrate the nature of scientific thought. With the advent of programs such as ""One Laptop per Child"" that are being implemented in several Latin American countries, it is appropriate to use these resources as a basis to generate low cost laboratories. This contribution may be a useful tool to improve the quality of science learning and to encourage vocations in science and engineering.

It does so by comparing the effect of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) on the digital skills of Chilean students compared with mathematics and language. This comparison is made using national standardized tests. The marginal effect of a group of variables measuring student ESCS was compared both as a whole and separately using multivariate linear regression analysis. The results show that the marginal effect of ESCS as a whole on students' digital skills was equal to the effect on mathematics and greater than the effect on language. Furthermore, the results show that the parents' level of education was the most relevant factor of ESCS for explaining student performance on the digital test, more so than for mathematics and language. These findings challenge the belief that the Internet would reduce economic, social and cultural inequalities in new generations. Instead, they reveal that the gap among Chilean students tends to perpetuate or widen when comparing performance in mathematics and language with performance in the digital domain. At the same time, by comparing national test results, this paper offers empirical evidence for the existence of a second digital divide in the field of education, a concept which is widely discussed at a theoretical level but with little empirical support to date. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital literacy; Digital skills test; Economic, social and cultural status; ICT; Second digital divide","Regression analysis; Digital divide; Digital literacies; Digital skills; Level of educations; Marginal effects; Multivariate linear regression analysis; Standardized tests; Student performance; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910636868

Its main objective is to describe the experience of promoting breastfeeding with nursing mothers, aiming at breast milk donation at a Primary Care Unit located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It reports the entire process: the training offered to the Unit’s professionals, the educational groups held with the nursing mothers, the selection of donors, and the collection, preservation, and transportation of donated breast milk to the Human Milk Bank. The whole process respected the guiding principles of popular education in health, such as lovingness and respect for the donors’ knowledge. Thus, it was possible to perceive that the stronger the bond between nursing mothers and the Unit’s professionals, the higher the number of breast milk donors and the amount of donated milk. © 2014, Fundacao UNI Botucatu/UNESP.

The sample is made up of 40 mapuche schoolchildren from 12 to 15 years old, in 7th and 8th grade at rural primary schools that are part of the Programa de Educación Intercultural Bilingüe (PEIB). This sample was complemented with the participation of 4 traditional Mapudungun teachers working in the participant schools. To collect the material, a sociolinguistic questionnaire and a focused interview were used, which intended to collect as much sociolinguistic information as possible, from the speakers, their families and the communities. The first instrument was applied to the school students, while the second instrument was applied to the traditional teachers. In the communities of Alto Bío-Bío, we have observed that a large number of Pewenches still maintain their language, although it should be noted that some differences in the maintenance of the language was observed among the two communities studied (Butalelbun y Cauñicu). Whereas, in Tirúa, language contact has left traces in the process of maintenance and language choice, since most families transmit only the official language to their children.","Intergenerational transmission; Language; Languages in contact; Mapudungun",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921940930

Our analysis is carried on an empirical produced by accompanying two Adult Education groups in their mathematic classes during three semesters. Those groups were attending the middle school for adults in a public school. This analysis highlights discourses from several ideological and pedagogical frames and motivations, sometimes in conflict. By identifying discursive formations in the adult mathematic classrooms and by putting in evidence their benchmarks and regulatory plots, this study aims at contributing for understanding those numeracy practices as pedagogical instances for inclusion and emancipation.","Discursive Practices; Education and Work; Ethnomathematics; Numeracy Practices; Youth and Adult Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920628350

The second methodology, based on the dialectic relations of induction-deduction, goes along a focus of Poisson's process. Both ways apply in two engineering careers, for the sake of evaluating the effect that they cause in learning. The learning is focused as developer, in the sense of integrating the processes of internalization and exteriorization of knowledge.

The model is developed from the socio-epistemological perspective and relies on the theory of discourse analysis as a social action to study school mathematical discourse. In particular, it is developed the way the theoretical and methodological framework was used to analyze the social process of institutionalization of the concept of limit on the Uruguayan educational context.

This paradox has been solved: it was shown that small biases toward the native conformation result in realistic folding times of realistic-length sequences. This solution of the paradox is, however, not amenable to most chemistry or biology students due to the demanding mathematics. Here, a simplification of the study of the paradox and its solution is provided so that it is accessible to chemists and biologists at an undergraduate or graduate level.

However, some universities in developing countries have difficulties acquiring the sophisticated instrumentation needed to demonstrate how to identify and quantify metals. In this context, a method was developed based on the flame test to quantify sodium in coconut water and seawater using recorded videos of a flame during the experiment and subsequent image treatments with an R statistics platform. This experiment provided undergraduate students an opportunity to study important topics such as atomic theory, emission spectroscopy, quantitative analysis, and image processing. Finally, students measured the sodium content in seawater collected from a region of the Rio Grande do Norte coast, an important region for manufacturing salt. They obtained sodium concentrations that ranged from 11.2 to 12.2 g dm-3 and calibration curves that presented good linearity (R2 &gt; 0.91).

We investigated to what extent student proficiency in English and the scientifi capabilities of academic advisors predict that success Methods: Our sample comprised 43 master's and doctoral students in psychiatry (n = 28 and n = 15, respectively) a the University of São Paulo School of Medicine, in São Paulo, Brazil. We collected information about their knowledge o English and the ways in which they wrote their articles to be submitted to periodicals published in English. Multipl regression analyses were carried out in order to investigate the influence English proficiency, h-index of supervisors an use of language editing assistance had on the number and impact of student publications Results: Although 60% of students scored ≥80 (out of 100) on English tests given at admission to the graduat program, 93.09% of the sample used some form of external editing assistance to produce their papers in English The variables ""number of publications"" and ""impact factor of journals"" were significantly related to each othe (r = 0.550, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the impact factor of periodicals where student published their articles as first authors correlated significantly not only with student proficiency in English a admission (p = 0.035), but also with the degree of language editing assistance (p = 0.050) and the h-index of th academic advisor (p = 0.050) Conclusions: Albeit relevant, knowledge of English was not the key factor for the publication success of th graduate students evaluated.

Furthermore, I like the students to discover astronomical phenomena for themselves, by means of a guided exercise, rather than just telling them the facts.1 The inclination and nodes may be found by direct observation, monitoring carefully the position of the Moon among the stars. Even the regression of the nodes may be discovered in this way2 To find the eccentricity from students' observations is also possible,3 but that requires considerable time and effort. if a whole class should discover it in a short time, here is a method more suitable for a one-day class or home assignment.

However, various studies have shown that a large number of elementary and secondary science teachers do not possess an adequate understanding of NOS. This study investigated how elementary teachers’ understanding of NOS was impacted through a 1-year professional development program in Chile that included NOS instruction as a theme throughout two types of mini-courses in the program. Twelve teachers attended a 1-year development program focused on improving teacher content knowledge and included the instruction of NOS embedded in two self-contained NOS mini-courses (36 h) and two lessons (3 h each) within five science content mini-courses (30 h). The Views of NOS (version D+) questionnaire and interviews were used to assess teachers’ understanding of NOS at the beginning (January) and end of the program (December). Elementary teachers’ understanding of the creative, inferential, and tentative aspect of NOS showed improvement. According to the teachers’ perceptions, the most significant activities for improving their NOS understanding were decontextualized activities in both types of mini-courses (self-contained NOS and science content mini-courses). The implications for professional development programs are also discussed. © 2014, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.","Chile; Elementary science teachers; Nature of science; NOS mini-courses; Professional development program; Teaching NOS",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019830449

Non-Newtonian suspensions of blue maize flour that naturally contain anthocyanins have been chosen as a model fluid. These anthocyanins act as a native, wide spectrum pH indicator exhibiting greenish colors in alkaline environments, blue tones in neutral conditions, and pink-violet colors in acid environments. Students used a continuous injection of a basic solution in an initially acidic environment to reveal mixing patterns and flow structures and to follow their evolution over time in a typical stirred tank configuration. These experiments aim to demonstrate, in a laboratory setting, basic concepts related to mixing: (i) the existence of mixing pathologies in laminar-stirred tanks; (ii) the complex rheology of some real suspensions; (iii) the effect of tank geometry on mixing performance; and (iv) the quantitation of mixedness and mixing evolution using digital color analysis.

This study seeks to determine the possible effects of the new GAI regarding both its objective of promoting equity in the student body composition and as a measure of academic aptitude capable of predicting student success. With these aims, the study compares the old and new GAI averages of 11 consecutive entering cohorts at the Bayamón campus of the UPR, and models the graduation GPA (GGPA) of 6 of these cohorts. Evidence shows that (a) the new GAI eliminated private school students’ advantage over those from public schools and reduced to a minimum the gap between genders; (b) female students obtain significantly higher GGPAs and exhibit other advantages when compared to males, while public and private school students’ academic outcomes are broadly similar; (c) the probability of accessing a determined boundary in the GGPA distribution is significantly and nonlinearly related to the GAI; (d) GGPAs exhibit an uptrend that varies inversely and significantly with the GAI, and (e) the probability of being in the lower bounds of the GGPA distribution increases to the extent that graduates exceed graduation required time. © 2014, Arizona State University.

A comparison was made of the ENLACE results-in language (reading comprehension) and mathematics for the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth grades-and the results of Excale and pisa , which were used as control tests. The conclusion is that the ENLACE /elementary education test was corrupted and suffered from the inflation of results due to three factors: the publication of schools' rankings, the association of results and economic stimuli for teachers, and the lack of external control for administering the test. Inflated results of the ENALCE/high school test may have been due to the use of less difficult questions in the test's recent versions.","Corruption of measure; Enlace test; Excale; Mexico; PISA; Score inflation; Standardized testing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908066025

Such outcomes suggest that the act of reading algebraic texts submerges the reader into a network of intertextual relations derived from that reader’s prior mathematics and linguistic experiences. In this article we propose an analytical perspective of algebraic activity that is based on intertextuality and that makes it possible to advance our knowledge concerning the production of sense in said activity. In particular, we resort to the notion of intertextuality as a means of theoretically describing and explaining sense production processes in the learning of two algebraic methods: the Cartesian Method (for the algebraic solution of word problems) and the Substitution Method (for the solution of systems of two linear equations with two unknowns). We support our arguments via a series of episodes of empirical study interviews with secondary school students, in order to demonstrate the pertinence and relevance of carrying out their analysis from the perspective proposed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Algebraic methods; Cartesian Method; Intertextuality in algebra teaching and learning; Sense production; Substitution Method; Texts and intertexts in algebra learning",,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 168620","Acknowledgments We want to thank Centro Escolar Revueltas in Mexico City for providing us with the facilities to carry out the empirical work of the long-term research project “Operating the unknown”.

The data analysis is based on the theory of the cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies the eliciting conditions for each emotion and the variables that affect the intensity of each emotion. The participant students' emotional experiences in mathematics classes are composed of: (1) satisfaction and disappointment while solving a problem; (2) joy or distress when taking a test; (3) fear and relief during classes; (4) pride and self-reproach during classes; and (5) boredom and interest during classes.

It is important to improve teaching methods that increase student motivation, not only to enhance their capacity for understanding, but also to generate a greater level of interest in the study of chemistry for their future professional life. Current technologies such as the virtual campus, which complements theory classes with class laboratories, help students feel better trained and more confident about scientific world. This improvement was reflected on the SABER 11° test results in chemistry made up by the Colombian Institute for Educational Evaluation (ICFES in Spanish), which were applied to the students of the leveling program ""National Academic Talent Plan"" (PNAT). This study found a positive effect when comparing pre-test and post-test scores (effect size of 0.61, moderate difference), and it was also observed an increase in the number of students placed at the medium standard and medium high range.

The central idea of the teaching approach is to propose the analysis of a mathematical model for a biological phenomenon at the very beginning of the course, in a way that this analysis is interrelated with some of the mathematical concepts listed in the syllabus. In this paper, we focus on the role of the software during the development of one of the activities proposed to the students, the purpose of which was to discuss the relation between secant lines and the instantaneous rate of change. It was found that this software played two roles in the development of this activity: providing information about the phenomenon and the model; and acting as a trigger, making evident to the student an important aspect that contributed to his understanding. Based on our theoretical perspective of digital technology, we believe that students’ interaction with the software played a fundamental role in the thinking collective composed of humans and media involved in mathematical learning. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Digital technology; Mathematical modeling; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926386642

Calculus continues to be taught as if it were natural to introduce the study of change and accumulation by means of the formalized ideas and concepts known as the mathematics of ε and δ. It is frequently considered as a failure that “students still seem to conceptualize limits via the imagination of motion.” These kinds of assertions show the tension, the rift created by traditional education between students’ intuitions and a misdirected formalization. In fact, I believe that the internal connections of the intuition of change and accumulation are not correctly translated into that arithmetical approach of ε and δ. There are other routes to formalization which cohere with these intuitions, and those are the ones discussed in this paper. My departing point is epistemic and once this discussion is put forward, I produce a narrative of classroom work, giving a special place to local conceptual organizations. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Archimedean principle; Continuum; Derivative; Formalization; Infinite; Infinitesimal; Intuition; Limit; Symbol; Variation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926383761

We identify four trends in the calculus research literature, starting with identifying misconceptions to investigations of the processes by which students learn particular concepts, evolving into classroom studies, and, more recently research on teacher knowledge, beliefs, and practices. These trends are related to a model for the cycle of research and development aimed at improving learning and teaching. We then make use of these four trends and the model for the cycle of research and development to highlight the contributions of the papers in this issue.

Although, apparently, both materials have different structures and content approaches, the analysis pointed out several similarities in the presented contents, in the sequence and in the disciplinary organization. These similarities indicate that the new teaching proposals suggested by the PCN and PNLD-EM are being superficially adopted by the textbooks. The initial hypothesis confirms itself by the excess of exercises in the workbooks and the constant reference to college's admission examinations that suggests a type of conditioning procedure.","Booklets; Mathematics curriculum; Propaedeutic or professional teaching; Textbooks",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907918855

We asked that they indicate the school year in which that expectation should be addressed. The results show that expectations are most suitable for the content present in textbooks in this stage of schooling. It also revealed that teachers feel freer to express an opinion on expectations that involve simpler skills. The more complex skills are the ones that receive fewer indications on the part of the teachers.

Particularly, we intend to reveal how the construction of written narratives by an in-service teacher has constituted an important process in her professional development, when she proposed and implemented an investigative methodology to the teaching of Mathematics, in a challenging classroom of a public school. The results show that the teacher, exchanging experiences with peer researchers, inserted new reflections on her pedagogical practices (in and over the action). Those records for future trends with mathematics investigations enhanced her potentialities of new learning, through the perspective of the proposal of new didactical sequences that can be significant to the students, and feasible to real and complex classrooms we find nowadays in public schools. We consider that the use of narratives has provided her a kind of continued education that has taken into account broader cultural scholar questions, her teaching knowledge and previous experiences, overcoming classical conceptions of teacher education. © 2014, BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

I argue that DMP may be conceptualized as multimodal narratives in which one communicates mathematical ideas using the arts. The students were enrolled in an extra-class course and produced two DMP under my supervision: a dramatic one and a musical one. Twelve different images of mathematicians were explored in the DMP. In my discussions, I highlight the narrative nature emergent from performance and the relation involving narrative, paramathematics, and identity. This research offers ways to deconstruct stereotypes about mathematics and mathematicians and supports the construction of alternate public images through the production of multimodal narratives based on the use of arts and digital technology. © 2014, BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Among the characteristic phenomena that may occur in these systems is the emergence of non-linear oscillations with a robust attractor cycle, i.e., phenomena that repeat on a regular basis and when are disturbed they return to their natural cycle of oscillation. A very important procedure to study them is the analysis of their behavior when are periodically forced. Despite the importance of these phenomena, their study is absent from the majority of undergraduate physics programs. A reason for that could be the complexity of many experimental set up employed to analyze them. This article presents a very simple experimental device: the saline oscillator, which allows a clear, direct and highly visual way for teaching the perturbation effect on nonlinear oscillators.","Limit cycle; Non-linear dynamics; Saline oscillator",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929620488

We also review and discuss the recent research in science education literature that proposes new ways of introducing quantum mechanics for undergraduate students. From these discussions, we suggest some possibilities-the inclusion of philosophical interpretations and their defense; the emphasis on strictly quantum features of the systems; an emphasis on formalism, without worrying about the ultimate ontological status of mathematics; the incorporation of quantum mechanics applications into real problems; and the need to introduce complementarity when using images-which can be taken into account when devising more effective ways of teaching introductory quantum mechanics for chemistry students.

Ultimately, the article shows that when video game's characteristics come in contact with expert knowledge during game design, the game becomes an excellent medium for supporting the learning of disciplinary content related to dynamic processes.

In solving linear equations, the students did not exhibit the 'didactic cut' of Filloy and Rojano (1989) or the subtleties arising from conceiving an equation as a balance (Vlassis, 2002). Instead they used 'procedural embodiments', shifting terms around with added 'rules' to obtain the correct answer (Lima & Tall, 2008). Faced with quadratic equations, the students learn to apply the formula with little success. The interpretation of this data requires earlier theories to be seen within a more comprehensive framework that places them in an evolving context. We use the developing framework of three worlds of mathematics (Tall, 2004, 2013), based fundamentally on human perceptions and actions and their consequences, at each stage taking into account the experiences that students have 'met-before' (Lima & Tall, 2008; McGowen & Tall, 2010). These experiences may be supportive in new contexts, encouraging pleasurable generalization, or problematic, causing confusion and even mathematical anxiety. We consider how this framework explains and predicts the observed data, how it evolves from earlier theories, and how it gives insights that have both theoretical and practical consequences. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Procedural embodiment; Quadratic equations; Solving equations; Theories of learning; Three worlds of mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893519092

The most used methods were documentary review, interviews, processing and analysis of statistical information both on care rendered to the population and academic work. This information was summarized in percentages, indicators, and others. The variables and indicators taken into account were those set by the university career evaluation and accreditation system. The main strengths were relevance and social impact of the careers in all the territories, the presence of the dentistry students in social impact tasks, the quality of professors as educators, among others. The most common weaknesses were related to systematic assurance of resources, the insufficient number of Ph doctors in the faculties and the scientific production did not reach the expected levels. Out of all the analyzed variables, the best results went to variable Social Relevance and Impact for all the careers, and the less satisfactory results were observed in the variable Professors.

This study has aimed to investigate the relationship between the development of working memory and performance on arithmetic activities. Method. We conducted a 3-year longitudinal study of a sample of 90 children, that was followed during the first, second and third year of primary school. All children were tested on measures of WM components (i. e., (i) phonological loop, (ii) visuospatial sketchpad and (iii) central executive) and arithmetic. Results. Results indicate the relationship between the progressive development of working memory capacity and performance in arithmetic through time. Evidence of this is that the group with higher working memory performance gets better scores in calculus, during the three years of study. Discussion and Conclusion. The discrepancy in scores in calculation increases as the years because of the impact it has on working memory strategies used for solving arithmetic problems. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (España).","Arithmetic knowledge; Calculation; Children; Working memory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898755972

From a single general exam, now there are tests in four areas: Mathematics, Language, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. A new reference matrix is build with components as cognitive domains, competencies, skills and knowledge objects; also, the methodological framework has changed, using now Item Response Theory to provide scores and allowing longitudinal comparison of results from different years, providing conditions for monitoring high school quality in Brazil. We present a study on the issues discussed in Natural Science Test of ENEM over the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Qualitative variables are proposed to characterize the items, and data from students' responses in physics items were analysed. The qualitative analysis reveals the characteristics of the exam in these years: long items, only a few of them demanding more complex reasoning, a characteristic of problem solving skills. The analysis of student performance also reveals that learning physics is not attained, with a percentage of correct answers on items that is almost always small, and that items that require some type of disciplinary knowledge or require use of mathematical reasoning presents a performance significantly weaker. © by the Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","ENEM secondary education assessment; Large scale assessments; Physics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895088253

However, such processes require so much time-consuming and not always provide the desired results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a model for the semiautomatic composition of LOs, which are automatically recovered from open repositories. For the development of model, various text similarity measures are discussed, while for calibration and validation some comparison experiments were performed using the results obtained by teachers. Experimental results show that when using a value of k (number of LOs selected) of at least 3, the percentage of similarities between the model and such made by experts exceeds 75%. To conclude, it can be established that the model proposed allows teachers to save time and effort for LOs selection by performing a pre-filter process.","Educational Technology; Educational Theory; Learning Object Repositories; Open Educational Resources",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098963996

Central to this path is the use of means of support in which the objects that unit fractions quantify are not characterized as equal-sized parts of a whole, but as entities that are always separate from a reference unit. We argue that such a path is crucial for helping students develop deep quantitative understandings of fractions, where fraction quantities are, from the very start, linked to the reciprocal and multiplicative relations that their use implies. We focus on the first part of the design experiment in which we helped the students make sense of a concept that is important for initial fraction learning and proportional reasoning, the inverse order relationship among unit fractions. © 2014 Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.","Design experiment; Fractions; Primary education; Proportional reasoning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895084798

The Internet Addiction Test (IAT) is a screening instrument used to detect IAworldwide, which was published in 1998 and inspired by the DSM-IV criteria for pathologic gambling. The objective of this study aims to measure the prevalence of IA in Chilean medical students and its possible association with demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Methods First- to fifth-year undergraduatemedical students at a medical school in Santiago de Chile answered a selfadministered survey that included demographic data, the IAT scale, and the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to screen for IA and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results Three hundred eighty-four students participated, achieving a response rate of 69.8 %, of which 11.5 % were classified as problematic users according to the IAT. The authors found a statistical association between positive results on the IATand positive scores on the GHQ-12, as well as with the male gender. Conclusion In this first study of IA in medical students, the authors found a rate of incidence similar to what has been published in the literature focusing on college students. Additionally, there was a positive association between emotional symptoms and other abuse behaviors. © 2014 Academic Psychiatry.","Abuse; Addiction; Behavior; Impulsive; Internet; Medical students","adult; Behavior, Addictive; Chile; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; depression; female; human; Internet; male; medical student; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; sex difference; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Chile; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Questionnaires; Sex Factors; Students, Medical; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895142794

We report on the career plans of final year medical students from 20 countries, investigating factors identified from the literature which influence psychiatric career choice. Methods. Cross sectional electronic or paper survey. Subjects were final year medical students at 46 medical schools in participating countries. We assessed students' career intentions, motivations, medical school teaching and exposure to psychiatry. We assessed students' attitudes and personality factors. The main outcome measure was likelihood of specializing in psychiatry. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the joint effect of factors upon the main outcome. Results: 2198 of 9135 (24%) of students responded (range 4 to 91%) across the countries. Internationally 4.5% of students definitely considered psychiatry as a career (range 1 to 12%). 19% of students (range 0 to 33%) were ""quite likely"", and 25% were ""definitely not"" considering psychiatry. Female gender, experience of mental/physical illness, media portrayal of doctors, and positive attitudes to psychiatry, but not personality factors, were associated with choosing psychiatry. Quality of psychiatric placement (correlation coefficient = 0.22, p < 0.001) and number of placements (correlation coefficient =0.21, p < 0.001) were associated with higher ATP scores. During medical school, experience of psychiatric enrichment activities (special studies modules and university psychiatry clubs), experience of acutely unwell patients and perceived clinical responsibility were all associated with choice of psychiatry. Multilevel logistic regression revealed six factors associated with students choosing psychiatry: importance of own vocation, odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.91, p < 0.001); interest in psychiatry before medical school, OR 10.8 (5.38 to 21.8, p < 0.001); undertaking a psychiatry special study module, OR 1.45 (1.05 to 2.01, p = 0.03) or elective OR 4.28 (2.87- 6.38, p < 0.001); membership of a university psychiatry club, OR 3.25 (2.87 to 6.38, p < 0.001); and exposure to didactic teaching, OR 0.54 (0.40 to 0.72, p < 0.001). Conclusions: We report factors relevant to medical student selection and psychiatry teaching which affect career choice. Addressing these factors may improve recruitment to psychiatry internationally. © 2014 Farooq et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Attitude to psychiatry; Career choice; Enrichment activity; Gender; Medical school selection; Medical student; Psychiatry; Recruitment; Stigma","adult; article; attitude; cross-sectional study; decision making; female; human; male; medical student; personality; psychiatry; psychological aspect; questionnaire; statistical model; young adult; Adult; Attitude; Career Choice; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Personality; Psychiatry; Questionnaires; Students, Medical; Young Adult",,"The study was funded in part by a World Psychiatric Association (WPA) grant to the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

The significant number of schools/heterogeneous classes in Brazil offers a rich material to produce shifts in the pedagogical naturalized truths regarding forms of school organization and curriculum. However, this raw material is obscured in training courses for teachers. The Deleuzian and the Guattariano concepts of rhizome and war machine are powerful to think about these schools/classes as a space of resistance to the logic of placing each individual in ""their"" place, destabilizing the principle of classification of school knowledge, of the processes of teaching-learning and the evaluation of the practices of the teacher, allowing the emergence of spaces of difference.","Curriculum; Educational practices; Schools/Heterogeneous classes; Teacher training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911889599

In all Spanish speaking countries, vectors are usually defined by magnitude, direction (line of action) and sense. On the other hand, in the United States, only the concepts of magnitude and direction (which in two dimensions is the angle between the vector and a reference axis) are used to define a vector. In Mexico, the first convention is usually used, however, because of the translation of books originally written in English, the American convention is introduced in this country too. In this study we administered a test to 512 students completing introductory physics courses at a Mexican university. We found alternative conceptions in the concepts of direction and sense, and difficulties due to the coexistence of the two conventions. A number of implications for the instruction of these two concepts in Spanish-speaking countries can be drawn from the results of this study. © 2014, Foundation Journal of Science Education.

For this, three activities were suggested, in which students should complete drawings of representations of molecules and they should decide whether the designed molecules were the same or different. All activities were videotaped and the students asked to think aloud, a technique known as “think aloud”. Subsequently, interviews were also made. In 75% of cases there was evidence of manifestation of metavisualization that possibly helped to self-regulate this process. The nature of the metavisual incidents was also analyzed and it was concluded that all incidents may be important, since students are rethinking ideas and hypotheses, whether they are correct or not.

Teachers' perceived self-efficacy to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in teaching can influence their behavior for integrating them into classes. Self-efficacy beliefs are constructed from four principal sources of information: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal or social persuasion, and physiological and affective states from which people partly judge their capableness, strength, and vulnerability. This study aimed to identify the sources that 241 Brazilian high school teachers in public schools perceive as contributing to the construction of their self-efficacy beliefs regarding using ICT in teaching. Data were collected in person and involved participants answering a ""Likert"" scale that investigated the sources of self-efficacy to use the computer in teaching. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Vicarious experience was the most perceived source by teachers as a constituent of their computer self-efficacy to teach, followed by social persuasion and mastery experience. The results allow us to reflect about factors that contribute to the construction of teacher's self-efficacy to use ICT in teaching. These factors may also help to create strategies for more effective integration of technologies with pedagogical practice. © Common Ground.

It presents the assessment of the Virtual Community Work (CVT) used in the Popular Healthcare Education Policy (PNEPS). Design/methodology/approach – The exploratory research adopted two paths of analysis, one quantitative (using questionnaire) aimed to collect the participants’ perceptions regarding the navigation, tools and features of CVT, and the other qualitative through observation of the interventions in its different spaces, having discourse analysis as the technique for analysis. Findings – The hands-on nature of Popular Education, revealed in the posts and in the speech of the participants, showed the potential and challenges of the territory and the need for change, both of the professional’s outlook on his or her own work process and working with health in the communities that are, still today, very centered around authoritarian models. Research limitations/implications – Because the participation was not mandatory, the reduced number of participants was the main limitation of this work. Practical implications – The health problems specified in the interactions and much discussed in CVT may help the consolidation of the policy as the main practical implication. Social implications – Contribute to the creation of a network for the exchange of educational experiences in the field of Popular Education.

In Spain there is much debate about the determinants of school failure and academic performance for college students, yet there are few references to the analysis of the relationship between the labour market and college students’ academic performance. This article contributes to the debate by presenting evidence pertinent to the Spanish case. Using a sample of Spanish college students, a multinomial logit model is estimated to determine the probability that a college student will enter the labour market. The effects of employment on academic performance are also estimated through an instrumental variable model. The findings show that the main determinants of entry in the labour market are student age, prior work experience and the money transferred to the student. In addition, employment is found to have a negative effect on students who work more than 15 hours a week. On the other hand, employment can produce positive academic performance in two circumstances: when the student works less than 15 hours a week and when the student has pre-college work experience. This is the major contribution of this research: to show that work experience can promote better academic performance. Another finding is that younger students who are just entering college and starting paid work for the first time form the group most subject to academic failure. Therefore, educational policy efforts should be devoted to these young people to improve their academic performance. © 2014, Ministry Education and Science.

Methods: We draw upon interviews undertaken with beginner and advanced nursing students from a Chilean university. Approval was obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee. The data were organised to allow the development of concepts by using the Grounded Theory approach. Results: The analysis uncovers paradoxical results of nursing education and its ineffectiveness in preventing gender-based inequalities. The interest in empowering nursing politically may lead to favour an increasing number of men entering nursing in ways that facilitate male students' progress. Furthermore, there exist discourses of compassion that feed consideration for male students, engendering in the process the prospect of professional success and the gravitation into strategic positions in the employment market. These are mechanisms that reproduce earlier gender-based inequalities in nursing. Conclusions: In the light of the social reproduction theory, the academisation of Chilean nursing seems to be built upon historical gender asymmetries. Although the interest of men in embracing a career in nursing may have a meaningful resonance with the transformation of contemporary society, this process needs a judicious examination in order to protect academic integrity and, ultimately, prevent the reproduction of those inequalities in question. This analysis offers a perspective for understanding social patterns embedded in the practice of nursing education in Chile and elsewhere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Gender; Male nursing student; Nursing education; Nursing students; Qualitative study; Social inequality; Sociology","Chile; female; grounded theory; human; male; male nurse; nursing student; pregnancy; psychology; sex difference; socialization; Chile; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Male; Nurses, Male; Pregnancy; Sex Factors; Socialization; Students, Nursing","European Commission, EC","This article is a part of the research project “Communication, empowerment and social identity of nursing” (DID S-2009-02) and one of the authors' doctoral dissertation ""Towards a Sociology of Nursing"".

These processes require pedagogical attention to professors’ performance that considers students in an active position on the teaching-learning-evaluation (Zabalza, 2011; Luke, 2011). Within the framework of this situation, this article gives account of a study conducted at the University of Porto (U. Porto) which aimed to analyse policy implications arising from the Bologna Process (PB) in the organization and in the curriculum development as well as the effects generated in the course due to the teaching method. Starting with issues that support higher education policies in Portugal in the pós-Bolonha (Leite & Fernandes, 2011), the study, in its empirical component, collects data through a questionnaire with two close-ended questions and one open question, answered by professors of the U.Porto. The data were analysed by simple statistics (closed questions) and content analysis (Krippenendorf, 2003) of the professors’ answers (openended question), This analysis points to the existence of paradigmatic tensions which reflect dilemmas arising between the ideal concept of the PB and the real conditions that the professors have to (re)organize and to develop the curriculum related with a critical orientation. ©, 2014, Edicoes Universitarias Lusofonas.

A qualitative approach with a focus on intervention research was used. The study was conducted in an EJA classroom, and the participants were a teacher and five students, two of whom presented intellectual disabilities. Observations in the classroom were carried out and interventions consisted of applying differentiated activities that focused on teaching this knowledge. The study showed that strategies such as games can effectively assist in the acquisition of mathematical concepts.

Concepts such as the notions of learning goals, errors, conceptual structure, representation systems, resources, grouping, interaction or assessment strategies are examples of such pedagogical concepts. We propose a model that involves three types of knowledge of a pedagogical concept- theoretical, technical and practical-for describing teachers' learning of it. The knowledge classification proposed by this model assumes that a teacher should know the theory about the pedagogical concept (theoretical knowledge), be able to use it for analysing the topic and producing information about it (technical knowledge), and be able to use this information for making decisions in the planning process (practical knowledge).

The constructivist-oriented subcomponent of the teachers' CK showed a significant association with student learning, although it is less significant than the association with the teacher's experience. Socioeconomic factors were strongly associated with student achievement, confirming the strong divisions that characterize the chilean education system.","Concepts; Education; Fractions understanding; Instruction; Knowledge of teaching of content; Learning; Pedagogical content knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916931019

This study aims to empirically diagnose the individual technical and behavioral competences required tutors' effective performance in the context of Universidade Aberta do Brasil (UAB - Open University of Brazil). Two studies were conducted using data triangulation. Study 1 was qualitative and involved document analysis, interviews and focus groups. In the Study 1, we conducted content analysis. For the data generated by Study 2, which was quantitative and used a questionnaire, we did statistical analysis. The sample (N = 200) consisted predominantly of female subjects, who had been tutoring for at least two years. Results have shown low competency gaps, indicating that the activities of recruitment, training and competency development have probably been carried out in accordance with the requirements of the duties of tutors.

The theoretical framework is based on a relationship between two theories from distinct areas: school climate and collective efficacy. The first originated from studies on school effectiveness and school effect; the second was developed in the context of urban sociology. This association was considered because of convergences identified between those two theories. Quantitative data were analyzed from a survey conducted in Rio de Janeiro concerning youth and violence. This resulted from a partnership between researchers from three universities: Universida de Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), and Universidade Cândido Mendes (UCAM). Preliminary results showed a negative association between indicators of school climate and perceptions of violence inside the school. These results suggest that in schools where students reported a greater number of violent occurrences, there also exists a school climate that students evaluate negatively. Besides the verification of this convergence by our study's results, other data suggest relationships between perceptions of violence within and outside the school and perceptions of the existence of drugs and violence at school.","Collective efficacy; Perceptions of violence; School climate",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915771911

Finally, we discuss the issue of utilitarian view of mathematics in the training of the future teachers in an experiment with undergraduate students at the Universidade Federal do Pará. The subjects showed the empirical applications of mathematics as a solution to their teaching, which implies that mathematics is present in the concrete world and its concepts are born of experience.

The results point to a higher prevalence of aggression in the classroom, followed by recess. There was also a predominance of individual acts of aggression. Since students spend most of their time at school in the classroom, to some extent it is expected that this would be where conflicts or even acts of violence occur. On the other hand, there is the constant presence of the teacher as well as a small number of students in the classroom, which demonstrates that aggression is carried out in the presence of the adult responsible for the group.","Classroom; School; School violence",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907623627

It focuses on the years 1956-1963 and devotes special attention to the expressions of Dante Moreira Leite and Luiz Pereira on the subject. The central argument is that the transformation of Sao Paulo city into a great metropolis became the articulating theme with which both authors investigated the performance and adaptation of school-age children, especially those identified as suburbanIII. A new urban culture challenged the school structure and, based on the legacy of Antonio Candido and Florestan Fernandes, such questions were investigated with a new pattern of research, which became the mark of CRPE-SP at that time. This new research pattern paved the way for new analytical resources to be mobilized to study the intelligence of children at school. The shortcomings of biological parameters for understanding the phenomenon of failure and its significant numbers were demonstrated. In addition to a new anthropological understanding about the interaction between the school culture and ways of living of the urban fringes, the research pattern established enriched the repertoire of sociological analyzes of the expansion in the number of school places in Sao Paulo city. For that sociology of education which then renewed, the strongly exclusionary nature of school failure was demonstrated in a masterly manner.","Intellectuals; Poor children; Research pattern; Schooling; Urban culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907580153

In the past few years, strategies have been generated to optimize the use of technological resources with the aim of facilitating widespread adoption of technology in the classroom. Given its low acquisition and maintenance costs, the interpersonal computer allows individual interaction and simultaneous learning with large groups of students. The purpose of this work was to compare arithmetical knowledge acquired by third-grade students through the use of game-based activities and non-game-based activities using an interpersonal computer, with knowledge acquired through the use of traditional paper-and-pencil activities, and to analyze their impact in various socio-cultural contexts. To do this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 271 students in three different countries (Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica), in both rural and urban schools. A set of educational games for practising arithmetic was developed and tested in six schools within these three countries. Results show that there were no significant differences (ANCOVA) in the learning acquired from game-based vs. non-game-based activities. However, both showed a significant difference when compared with the traditional method. Additionally, both groups using the interpersonal computer showed higher levels of student interest than the traditional method group, and these technological methods were seen to be especially effective in increasing learning among weaker students. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).","Arithmetic practice; Cross-cultural projects; Educational games; Intelligent tutoring systems; Interpersonal computer; Shared display",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907301471

The theoretical approach used for the development of research incorporates some aspects of Peirce's theory of scientific method and mathematical reasoning, which can interpret the arguments developed by students in the resolution of the different task and discuss the results of other studies that are assigned to the same line of research, such as the proposed Cañadas and Castro (2007) about conjecture process.

In the first part of the work, the symbolic system used in basic electromagnetism books when presenting the concept of electric flux is compared with the symbolic system used in calculus books when presenting Gauss' Theorem. The analysis was guided by the Dual Coding Theory posed by Sadoski & Paivio (2004). The results show that, while there exists a great deal of uniformity within one area (Physics or Calculus), there exist discrepancies between areas. The second part of this work deals with the symbolic-symbolic translation that students are able to carry out when having learned Gauss Theorem with a symbolic system that is different from the one used in Physics. It is suggested that the lack of interpretation of what the symbols mean can initially contribute to hinder comprehension about the flux concept.","Electrostatics; Flux concept; Physics learning; Physics texts; Symbolic system",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906656940

This study aimed to identify the between-school variability in Portuguese children PA and to investigate student and school PA correlates using multilevel modeling. METHODS: The sample included 1075 Portuguese children of both sexes, aged 6-10 years, from 24 schools. Height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was estimated. Physical activity was estimated using the Godin and Shephard questionnaire (total PA score was used); cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated with the 1-mile run/walk test. A structured inventory was used to access information about the school environment. A multilevel analysis (level-1: student-level; level-2: school-level) was used. RESULTS: Student-level variables (age, sex, 1-mile run/walk test) explained 7% of the 64% variance fraction of the individual-level PA; however, school context explained approximately 36% of the total PA variance. Variables included in the model (school size, school setting, playground area, frequency and duration of physical education class, and qualification of physical education teacher) are responsible for 80% of the context variance. CONCLUSIONS: School environment is an important correlate of PA among children, enhancing children's opportunities for being active and healthy. © 2014, American School Health Association.","Correlates; Exercise; Hierarchical linear modeling; Youth","age; body mass; child; demography; environment; exercise; female; human; male; morphometrics; multilevel analysis; physical education; Portugal; recreation; school; sex difference; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Age Factors; Body Mass Index; Body Weights and Measures; Child; Environment; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Multilevel Analysis; Physical Education and Training; Play and Playthings; Portugal; Residence Characteristics; Schools; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906499530

In each of them the student must recognize whether the event is random or not, and then argue the decision. The analysis of the responses based on the category system proposed, allows to affirm that the biology student teachers recognize more random events than mathematics student teachers.

The means by which Spanish-speaking children learn to produce number-gender linguistic markers has not been sufficiently investigated. Thirty-eight three-year-olds were tested in Berko-like production tasks, in which they were asked to pluralize or singularize familiar and novel words, with controls for allomorph, number of syllables, and word familiarity. Children found it easier to pluralize and singularize words with the allomorph /-s/ than those requiring /-es/, independent of their familiarity or syllable length. Children also produced a wide variety of noun phrases in which they tended to mark number information in more than one element. These data suggest that Spanish-speaking children's inflectional abilities are mainly influenced by phonological features such as word-endings and not, as previously reported, by the familiarity of the word or syllable length. © The Author(s) 2014.","Elicitation task; inflectional morphology; language acquisition; number allomorphs; Spanish number morphology",,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 167900, IN309214","This research was supported by funds awarded to N.

However, to obtain these potential advantages something more than forming and assigning them a common goal is needed: cooperation has to occur. This paper presents guidelines for designing group activities to foster cooperation by focusing on three elements of cooperative learning: (1) positive interdependence, (2) equal participation and (3) individual accountability in both individual and group learning scenarios. The authors also describe a software tool designed according to the model proposed in which some design guidelines have been implemented in order to support cooperative learning activities and allow the cooperative process to be monitored.

The lack of sufficient well-trained medical school faculty is one of Mozambique's major barrier to producing new physicians annually. A partnership between the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and the University of California, San Diego, has addressed this challenge with support from the Medical Education Partnership Initiative. After an initial needs assessment involving questionnaires and focus groups of residents, and working with key members from the Ministry of Health, the Medical Council, and Maputo Central Hospital, a set of interventions was designed. The hospital's internal medicine residency program was chosen as the focus for the plan. Interventions included curriculum design, new teaching methodologies, investment in an informatics infrastructure for access to digital references, building capacity to support clinical research, and providing financial incentives to retain junior faculty. The number of candidates entering the internal medicine residency program has increased, and detailed monitoring and evaluation is measuring the impact of these changes on the quality of training.

An exploratory investigation of descriptive and bibliographical nature was carried out. Using bibliographic information and academic productions abstracts, the aim was to catalogue relevant information and map this field of knowledge. The collected data enabled us to observe the yearly distribution according to the mode of academic production, the geographical distribution, according to location of public and private universities, funding levels and the graduate programs responsible for the production. The results corroborate the results from other studies that focused on similar aspects, such as the steady growth in the number of Masters' and Doctoral studies in the country, the prevalence of productions at the Masters' level, the geographical distribution and institutional studies concentrated in the Southeast and Southern regions, and the insufficient level of funding, by means of grants and scholarships for scientific production. The study showed the involvement of a significant percentage of private institutions, the prevalence of studies related to Education, Language and Literature, and Linguistics programs, as well as the presence of programs commonly observed in diverse areas of investigation, such as Computer Science, Engineering and Technology programs.

In this case study, data was collected from almost a third of the undergraduate students in mathematics courses. The survey instrument was a questionnaire designed to carry out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of their knowledge and conceptions about HA/G. The results pointed out that the majority of the students had not studied this topic and it is not addressed in their courses. For this reason, they are unaware of the relevant legislation on this theme, much less that the terms ""giftedness"" and ""high abilities"" mean the same thing. Due to their lack of information, their answers revealed various mythological conceptions, as juxtaposed to the literature.

Questions have been asked following the growth of this mode of instructional activity. Researchers have investigated methods to assess the benefits of e-learning from a number of perspectives. This survey assesses the associations among the system quality, information quality, and service quality on student satisfaction and use of systems in virtual learning environments using the e-learning success model adapted by Holsapple and Lee-Post from the Delone and McLean (1992, 2003) model as a theoretical basis. The survey was carried out by means of an online program offered to 291 students from public and private institutions from several regions of Brazil. Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling were used for data analysis in order to understand the student satisfaction process in virtual learning system. Findings show that variations in system quality, information quality, and service quality influence the use of the system, and the User Satisfaction construct had 89% of variance explained by Information Quality and Service Quality. Many of the benefits of distance learning programs are related to students' satisfaction and the intensity with which they make use of the learning system. With awareness of the indicators that are antecedents of these variables, education executives can plan investments that meet the most significant demands and use the information to deal with one of the major problems in distance learning: the dropout rate. Future researches should study this subject longitudinally.","Distance education; Quality in e-learning; Student satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905097220

Why would a university open a medical program? Yet, from 1990 to 2010 medical schools in Chilean universities increased in number from 6 to 28. This growth took place as overall enrolments also expanded four-fold nationally in all fields of higher education, and medical students multiplied by three in the same period. But this expansion of medical education cannot be explained solely on the basis of greater access to higher education and increased demand. An increase in supply was also needed. Why did new medical schools emerge in Chilean universities? Only to create more slots for future MDs? Through the interview-based study reported in this article, we seek to recover the rationale for the creation of medical schools in Chile in the last two decades, and interpret the results according to two theoretical perspectives: the new institutionalism in organizations, and signalling theory. In the recollections of the protagonists of these processes we find evidence both of a quest for academic legitimacy and the intention to provide signals to the market, and a rationale for how these two purposes support one another, as the main benefit foreseen by the promoters of the new medical schools was the improvement of the academic reputation of the university, which in turn would serve to strengthen its competitive position vis á vis other universities.","Competititon: markets; Institutionalism in organizations; Legitimacy; Medical education; New programs; Program creation; Reputation; Signaling theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905027355

However, nearly all of these studies took place in hospitals where medical students had been involved in patient care for many years. Less is known about patients' perceptions of care in a hospital moving toward becoming a teaching facility with undergraduate students. No research has explored patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. Objective: To assess patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality of care (QoC) from the patients' perspective, before and after the presence of medical students in a general hospital setting. Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Universitario-Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (HU-FSFB) in Bogotá, Colombia. The study had two phases. In 2006, prior to HU-FSBF becoming a teaching hospital, 385 subjects were asked to fill out a closed-question questionnaire addressing patients' satisfaction and perception of QoC provided by attending physicians. During the second period in 2009, 372 patients answered the same questionnaire when medical students were involved in their care. Results: Patients' perceptions of QoC provided by attending physicians improved in five aspects when medical students were present: friendliness (p = 0.003), competence providing medical care (p = 0.049), quality of information provided (p = 0.025), amount of time spent with the patient (p < 0.001) and availability to personally provide care (p < 0.001). Overall patient satisfaction also significantly increased (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of medical students does not negatively affect patients' perceptions of QoC, on the contrary, these results provide evidence of improved patient satisfaction in several aspects of care when medical students were involved. The relevance of this study lies in its unique way of comparing patient satisfaction before and after the introduction of medical students. This setting helps elucidate the real effect of the presence of medical students on patient satisfaction. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

The symbolic register had 3 representations: an expanded sum, a sum in sigma notation, and the definite integral. Reviewing the same texts, we found that in the presentation of double and triple integrals, not a single textbook continues to present the numerical register and the expanded sum representation of the symbolic register. They are implied and the expectation appears to be that students no longer need them. The omission of these representations is quite ubiquitous and correspondingly affects millions of students. Materials that present the missing numerical register representation and the expanded sum representation of the symbolic register throughout topics associated with double and triple integrals have been created. This paper presents the results of a clinical study on the improvement of student comprehension of multivariable integral topics when these representations are included. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.","definite integral; functions of two variables; multivariable calculus; register of representations; Riemann sum; semiotic registers; synergy of registers; transitional auxiliary representation",,"National Science Foundation, NSF: NSF-DUE 0941877","The material in this article is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant NSF-DUE 0941877.

In this context, performs comparisons between the offer of the Programa Nacional de Inclusão de Jovens - ProJovem Urbano (PJU) and the Education of young people and Adults (EJA). Our goal is to find evidences of PJU's possible social effects over educational provision for young people, compared to the conditions offered by the EJA to its young audience. In the analysis, were developed basic descriptive statistics procedures, comparing profiles of students, teachers and schools, using data from the monitoring system of the PJU and also those from Censo Escolar - INEP database. Comparisons explain similarities and differences between the two scenarios. Statistically, the comparisons show that in some of the aspects analyzed PJU's offer is better than the EJA. On the other hand, also show ways in which the EJA offers better conditions than the PJU. These differences influence qualitatively the educational provision for young people and point to the need of a deeper approach to the understanding of its causes, as well as possible strategies for its treatment.","Program evaluation; Public policies; Youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903878779

In 2009, the Mexican Ministry of Education formalized the Programa Nacional de Inglés en Educación Básica (PNIEB) as part of the national curriculum, based on the argument that increasing the number of English speakers in Mexico is necessary for the country to be globally competitive and to follow the trend in other developing economies of augmenting English instruction in public education. This paper focuses on the implementation of PNIEB and the state programs that preceded it. The authors document the practices and challenges associated with the program based on data collected from interviews with the main stakeholders involved (students and parents, teachers, school principals, and program coordinators) and from classroom observations. The total data-set consisted of over 200 interviews and classroom observations spread over several years from 2008 to 2012. Several challenges are described, including the development of materials, the role of English in relation to other subject areas, and the training of teachers who often speak English but have uneven formal preparation. The status of the teachers, both as second-class citizens within the schools and the instability and irregularities with their contracts, was identified as the most significant challenge to the successful implementation of the programs. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","educational theory of change; English as an additional language; Mexico; multisite qualitative policy research; PNIEB; primary schools; public schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903535609

As a result, Honduras has implemented a number of middle school alternative programmes designed to meet the needs of at-risk populations throughout the country. This article analyses dropout in three of the four main alternative lower secondary school programmes in Honduras over a three-year period for a cohort of roughly 5,500 students. The results show that these programmes are indeed reaching a vulnerable population in the country, but dropout rates are generally very high - upwards of 50 per cent in some cases - between Grades 7 and 9. Furthermore, even in the control school comparison samples made up of formal lower secondary schools, about 25 per cent of children leave school between Grades 7 and 9. The authors' analysis includes propensity score matching (PSM) methods that make more focused comparisons between students in alternative programmes and control samples. These results show that dropout rates in alternative programmes are not much different than in control schools, and only significant in one programme comparison, when taking into account family background characteristics like socioeconomic status (SES). Multivariate analysis within alternative programme samples finds that attrition is lower in those learning centres which have adopted key features of formal schools, such as university-educated teachers. The results highlight the tremendous variation in the alternative middle school sector in terms of programme features, school quality and student outcomes, as well as the challenges of expanding this sector to meet the growing demand for lower secondary schooling in Honduras. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","Alternative education; Education policy; Educatodos, Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial (SAT); Honduras; Latin America; School attendance; School quality; Sistema de Educación Media a Distancia (SEMED)","education policy; educational development; policy approach; policy implementation; secondary education; socioeconomic status; Honduras",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903156022

We consider these social practices that involve mathematical ideas, criteria and representations to be literacy practices, constituted by ways of using written language and informed by the relations that they establish with the values and knowledge of written culture. We analyze the discursive positions taken by subjects in classroom interactions during the correction of a mathematics activity in which students were requested to indicate the order of magnitude of some objects and the expression of their approximate measurements using the decimal metric system. While the school proposal required the production of estimates at the expense of reference in specific situations, students produced responses referenced in contextual situations and tried to be precise. Our analysis suggests that the learning processes of school numeracy practices are not restricted to a technical dimension, and are related to the ways subjects learn the values linked to them. In the educational discursive interplay, students take various positions, which sometimes sympathize with the school's ways of knowing, and sometimes question them. Thus, students act as subjects of learning in several ways of knowing and relating to the world.","Appropriation; Learning; Literacy; Numeracy; Youth and adult education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902517623

However, such processes require so much time-consuming and not always provide the desired results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose a model for the semiautomatic composition of LOs, which are automatically recovered from open repositories. For the development of model, various text similarity measures are discussed, while for calibration and validation some comparison experiments were performed using the results obtained by teachers. Experimental results show that when using a value of k (number of LOs selected) of at least 3, the percentage of similarities between the model and such made by experts exceeds 75%.

Among the admission requirements of dentistry studies in Universidad de Concepción, the grade point averages obtained at the secondary education has 25% weighing, so it is important to determine its predictive validity and to verify whether this average is the same for the different educational centers or not. Objectives: to determine the evolution of the dependency and the predictive validity of the grade point averages of the secondary education, by making a comparison among the different types of educational establisments. Methods: longitudinal, observational and descriptive study of first-year dentistry students. The admission profile forms were checked, thus obtaining the information on the secondary education grade point averages and on dependency. The academic performance of students was obtained from grade worksheets of the Register and Control office. Results: it was observed that the number of students from subsidized educational centers increased, 33.3 % in 2004 to 57.4 % in 2011, whereas the number of students from private schools decreased, 44.9 % in 2004 to 22.0 % in 2011. The contributing percentage of the grade point averages to the academic achievement reached 10.8 %. The highest contributing percentages went to the grade point averages of private schools with a 15.0 %, followed by the municipal and subsidized schools with 9.6 % and 8.6 % respectively. Conclusions: there is a tendency to increase of the number of students from subsidized schools, and to decrease of the number of students from private schools. The predictive validity of the grade point averages was limited, since there is prediction bias favoring the municipal and subsidized schools.","Academic achievement; Different educational centers; Predictive capacity; Secondary school grade point average",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902120141

It is then important that they can develop the competence and the culture of identifying and reporting adverse events that will allow providing more information for hospitals and health care systems. Objective: to describe how training makes it possible to encourage the culture of reporting adverse events in medical, nutrition and biomedical engineering students. Methods: retrospective, cross-sectional and analytical study of reports of adverse events described by medical, nutrition and biomedical engineering students as well as medical residents. The adverse events, quasi-faults and sentinels were all classified. The variables called correct and complete were identified and the information was presented with summary statistics using STATA 8.0 programs. Results: two hundred and three reports were collected. The participants were 157 medical students, 28 from biomedical engineering, 13 from nutrition and 7 quality medical residents. In this group, 37 % (73 cases) were correct reports and 52 % (104 cases) were complete. Complete and correct reports represented 19 % (38 cases). Conclusions: some part of the adverse reports tended to be unreported, thus restricting their analysis. It is required to continue insisting on all the undergraduate students about the importance of these reports and of duly and completely filled them in. The competence of identification of adverse events of the students could be determining to improve the systems of adverse event reporting, could strengthen the culture about this process and all this may lead to the improvement of the patient safety.","Adverse events; Sentinel events; Undergraduate students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902080560

A teaching strategy and problem-solving methodology was implemented, designed on the basis of frequent errors in reasoning about conditional probability. The students' work was analyzed before and after instruction. The purpose was to contribute to the construction of meaning of the formula in this theorem, to promote the ability to perform transformations between representations in different registers. Students who developed this ability showed fewer difficulties with the problem-sovling.

However, in general, in the educational system, formal construction processes and algorithmic aspects have been prioritized. Seeking to answer this problem, an investigation addressing the study of the derivative was started. The work was framed from the perspective of Variational Thought and Language, which studies the relationship between research and social practices that rules the mathematics of change and variation in educational systems. In a didactic engineering context, a sequence was designed and presented in a Mathematics II class attended by Agricultural Engineering students. The activities made it possible to analyse different scenarios of variation (which magnitudes change, how and how much they change), characterize variations between magnitudes, through the calculation of rates of change, and explore how the slope of a curve is related to the rate of change. Its presentation from different representations contributes to the development of one of the cognitive processes involved in mathematical thinking: visualization. In this article, the theoretical and methodological aspects that support the design of the sequence are briefly described, and some results of its implementation from the observation of the activities developed by the students are presented. The proposal managed to motivate students. The discussion of the results will contribute to the optimization of the sequence.","Derivative; Learning; Teaching; Variational thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901951221

Students were classified based on the initial test into two categories (high rating - low rating), and it was established that the high rating students of the EG scored significantly higher in the final test performance than those of the CG (Mann-Whitney test was used). No differences were detected between subgroups of low rating groups. EG members had significantly higher scores than those of CG in Calculus's tasks (we used a Student's t test).

This work is part of a broader research that considered a multiple case study. Here we present the results obtained from two of them To investigate constructed learning we used Dubinsky's APOS cognitive model. We created an interactive teaching environment, supported by classroom lessons and class modules of practical work based on Computer Workshops. Some results will be mentioned briefly. It was found that if the concept of ""Derivative at a point"" is not understood at the level of action, the students have difficulty in extending it and moving to a higher level of understanding and interpreting the concept geometrically. They also have difficulties understanding when they have to discriminate between true and false propositions set out on properties of the derivative related to monotony and concavity of a function.

The first study identified and described tools available for assessing receptive vocabulary and their respective word lists. The second identified and described research that presented word inventories or word lists. The third study identified the vocabulary reported by parents and teachers. The words that were identified in the three studies were analyzed according to: the number of times they occurred; the Picture Communication Symbols system classification; and a semantic and syntactic classification. Based on these studies the following criteria for vocabulary selection were established for word selection: the 45 words which appeared in all three studies, the words that occurred five times or more, considering the three studies, representing 167 (14.14%) words; the words identified in study one or two, but that had been reported by the families - 183 (19.37% out of 945 words) - or by teachers - 108 (11.43% out of 945 words).

We developed different rating scales for each and then explored how each scoring method accounts for the students' mathematical/numerical and creative skills. The psychometric properties for both scoring approaches were examined. Each method was shown to reflect different relationships with other performance tests. In addition, it is proposed that MaC may provide useful insight into students' levels of adaptive expertise in mathematics, as reflected by their ability to apply mathematical knowledge (i.e., language, operations, concepts) to novel situations, representing an informative supplement to performance indicators of math achievement. © 2013 by the Creative Education Foundation, Inc.","assessment; creativity; mathematics; numeracy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898647120

We consider how the ReMath approach of using cross-studies, and especially the inclusion of a cross-analysis phase, served to identify particularities associated with designing and implementing mathematics learning scenarios using digital tools. In their discussion of the process of re-contextualising, one of the factors which appears to have been particularly influential in shaping research activities was theoretical framework and they show how this factor both influences and is influenced by institutional and cultural characteristics. To further explore some of the other important contextual factors they pinpoint, such as the role and engagement of teachers, student characteristics and issues related to the empirical settings, we reflect upon the processes of re-contextualisation that we could identify in our own research. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Context; Cross-experimentation and analysis; Digital technologies; Networking theories",,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 23038.019444/2009-33; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","3This project was funded by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (project no. 23038.019444/2009-33).

What happens to the mathematical development of children who have a different form of language such as the sign language used by deaf people? This question, and other questions about deaf students' low performance in mathematics documented by other studies guided the development of the study presented here. To answer these questions, experimental tests were carried out with deaf children (group 1), younger hearing children from public schools (group 2), older hearing children from public schools (group 3) and children from private schools (group 4). The results evidenced a clear distinction between mathematical cognitive skills more dependent and less dependent on linguistic stimuli, notifying that deaf children have the same performance, or in some cases even higher performance than hearing children in skills less dependent on linguistic stimuli. However, both deaf children and younger hearing children from public schools had a significantly lower performance in comparison to older hearing children from public schools and children from private schools. This result indicates that deafness is not a cause of poor academic performance in mathematics. Thus, it seems necessary to think of forms of pedagogical intervention which can ensure the successful learning of mathematics for both deaf children and hearing children who attend public schools in Brazil.","Cognition; Counting; Deafness; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896526902

Both approaches use hierarchical linear models, allowing the natural grouping of educational data from three levels: student, class and school. The first value-added approach builds models whose dependent variable is the student proficiency in each year evaluated. With a separate model for each year, it is possible to detect factors of the student, class and school associated with student performance. The second approach creates models to show the effect of the covariates of student, class and school on progress curves of proficiency throughout the study period. When comparing the two types of value-added models, the first one was the most efficient in diagnosing the effects of the environment and the teacher's pedagogical practice, but only in certain grades.

But the difficulties experienced in the implementation of such policies may contribute to the development of stress among teachers. Keeping this in view, this study has sought to identify stressors and levels of teacher stress and examine sociodemographic, personal, work and student variables, according to the presence of stress. Nineteen teachers of classes of 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of primary education in public schools in Vitória city, Espírito Santo state, Brazil, working with classes with students with SEN, responded to Lipp's Inventory of Stress Symptoms for Adults, a questionnaire with variables of interest and six scales of stressors and coping, translated and adapted especially for this study. The large number of students and their behavioral problems were the most frequent stressors. With regard to inclusive education, the main results were work overload and the perception that the government is little concerned with providing support for work. However, it is noteworthy that the inclusion of pupils with SEN was a less cited factor and may not, thus, be the central variable for stress. Actually, teachers with stress identified more often the following cause: the perception of the public misunderstanding of the teaching work. Based on this finding, we suggest interventions to promote well-being among teachers.","Coping; Inclusive education; Stress; Teachers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896499267

Four variables of OTL were measured: hours of class per year, curriculum coverage, quality of teachers' feedback, and level of cognitive demand. The last three were measured through an analysis of the exercises attempted by fourth grade students in their notebooks and workbooks. Multivariate analysis showed a robust association of one of the OTL variables (curriculum coverage, more specifically number of exercises attempted by students) with achievement in mathematics. Moreover SES at the age of one was significantly associated with this variable and with achievement by the time students were ten years old. Overall, the findings of the paper illustrate a highly unequal education system in which relatively poor children have fewer OTL in school. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","educational inequality; mathematics achievement; opportunities to learn; Peru; primary education",,"International Development Research Centre, IDRC","This study was possible thanks to the support provided by the Young Lives Study.

To this end, 3302 children participating in the child labor eradication program ""Edúcame Primero Colombia"" were interviewed. The interview format used for the children's enrollment into the program was a template from which socioeconomic conditions, academic performance, and child labor variables were evaluated. The academic performance factor was determined using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The data were analyzed through a logistic regression model that took into account children who engaged in a type of labor (n= 921). The results showed that labor conditions, the number of weekly hours dedicated to work, and the presence of work scheduled in the morning negatively affected the academic performance of child laborers. These results show that the relationship between child labor and academic performance is based on the conflict between these two activities. These results do not indicate a linear and simple relationship associated with the recognition of the presence or absence of child labor.

In SDG students work in groups that share one area on a large display screen in front of the class. Each individual student in a group has a mouse and together the students in each group need to perform assignments by using ""silent collaboration"". In the current study, the assignment for the students was to identify and create different kinds of triangles. Outcomes of interest were learning gains (quantitative) and effectiveness of ""silent collaboration"" (qualitative). Learning gains were significantly higher for students in the SDG condition than for students following traditional instruction.
