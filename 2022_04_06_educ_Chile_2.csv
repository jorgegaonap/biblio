This quantitative case study of Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile sought to understand the longitudinal contributions of combinations of types of financial aid to persistence of low-income students. The results identified that the aggregate availability of both grants and loans at the university-level has a net positive contribution beyond the contributions of national-level grants and loans. In finest distinction, however, only ministry aid (in the form of need-based grants and loans) decreased the likelihood of dropping out. Such findings suggest that universities may want to consider carefully as part of a comprehensive persistence plan how they leverage institution-level contributions to student aid packages.;"[Horn, Catherine] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Veronica Santelices, Maria; Catalan Avendano, Ximena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Horn, C (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;clhorn2@uh.edu;"Catalán-Avendaño, Ximena/H-3252-2017; HORN, CATHERINE L./B-4520-2015";"Catalán-Avendaño, Ximena/0000-0003-1408-7621; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670; HORN, CATHERINE L./0000-0003-4959-5810";;;;47;7;7;0;38;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Here we identify three large descriptive frameworks for critical thinking: that of argumentative logic, the axiological framework and the cognitive perspective. All these contributions, as well as the complex bundle of theoretical lines and concepts in which this construct is inscribed, are analyzed from the point of view of theory of education. Based on this, we then discuss how to orient pedagogical action towards training in critical thinking. We conclude by identifying the traits of a critical thinker as an actor who constructs and registers the potentialities of cognition and relates them to praxis, that is, with a reflexive action oriented towards decision-making.;"[Martin Garcia, Antonio Victor] Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Bradasic, Oscar Barrientos] Univ Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile";;Garcia, AVM (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, Paseo Canalejas 169, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.;"avmg@usal.es; obradasic@hotmail.com";Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/L-4931-2014;Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/0000-0002-0216-2754;;;;52;0;0;0;5;EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA;SALAMANCA;APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN;1130-3743;2386-5660;;TEOR EDUC;Teor.

This unprecedented situation has led to multiple challenges in the host countries in terms of managing the social integration process of migrants. The situation has particularly affected minors, with the consequent impact on local education systems. Within this context, the MICREATE project - Migrant Children and Communities in a Transforming Europe (HORIZON 2020-822664) - emerged, whose main objective is to identify and meet the specific needs of children and young migrants related to integration into the host societies via school. The research is being conducted using a mixed methodology with a child-centred approach in order to avoid the assumptions with which adults tend to think about integration. In this way, we seek to create a space that enables them to express their interests and experiences. This project, which will last three years, is expected to enable us to rethink integration policies and strategies by generating new knowledge and promoting new solutions for education institutions and policies.;"[Rivera-Vargas, Pablo; Mino-Puigcercos, Raquel; Estalayo-Bielsa, Paula; Lozano-Mulet, Paula] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile";;Rivera-Vargas, P (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, 171 Edificio Llevant,Despacho 222, Barcelona 08035, Catalunya, Spain.;pablorivera@ub.edu;Rivera-Vargas, Pablo/I-3115-2015;"Rivera-Vargas, Pablo/0000-0002-9564-2596; Mino Puigcercos, Raquel/0000-0002-5391-4637";Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [822664];This work was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [822664]. / Este trabajo se realizo con el apoyo del Programa Marco Horizonte 2020 [822664].;;8;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC-UK;Cult.

From a functional approach to early algebra, we describe written students' answers when working with a problem that involves a function, which includes questions for specific values and to generalize. Design research guidelines, specifically those set out for Classroom Teaching Experiment were followed. This study addresses the fourth and last Classroom Teaching Experiment session, which involved a function of the type y = ax + b and students had not previously worked it. Students primarily evidenced correspondence relationship, using natural language and numerical representation to express this functional relationship. Our findings let us to state that (a) although students were not used to working with these types of problems, eleven of them go beyond arithmetic computations, finding relationships that relate the variables; and (b) three students generalized using natural language as a useful vehicle, while there are other students who perceived the same regularity for different specific values but they are unable to represent generalization clearly.";"[Pinto, Eder] Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Las Condes 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile; [Canadas, Maria C.; Moreno, Antonio] Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18071, Spain";;Pinto, E (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Las Condes 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile.;"epinto@udd.cl; mconsu@ugr.es; amverdejo@ugr.es";"Moreno, Antonio/AAA-1981-2020; Canadas, Maria C./F-1672-2016";"Moreno, Antonio/0000-0002-8284-3903; Canadas, Maria C./0000-0001-5703-2335";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [EDU2016-75771-P]; Chilean Government through the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [folio 72160307-2015]";"This study was conducted under National R&D Project EDU2016-75771-P funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; the first author benefited from a PhD. grant awarded the by Chilean Government through the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), folio 72160307-2015.";;41;0;0;5;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

It argues that holding teacher education accountable has been the major approach to reforming teacher education in the US for the last two decades, assuming that enhanced teacher education quality depends on vigilant public evaluation and monitoring of outcomes related to teacher education institutions, programs, and teacher candidates. This article looks back at the era of accountability by examining five policy, political, and professional developments that contributed to its emergence and strong hold on US teacher education. Looking forward to the future of teacher education accountability in the US, the article argues that we need a new approach - democratic accountability in teacher education - which is based on intelligent professional responsibility for students' learning including democratic knowledge and skills, strong equity, and genuine collaboration with multiple stakeholders.;"[Cochran-Smith, Marilyn] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ, Urban Sch, Teacher Educ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Burton, Stephani; Chang, Wen-Chia; Carney, Molly Cummings; Sanchez, Juan Gabriel] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Baker, Megina] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Project Zero, Pedag Play Project, Cambridge, MA USA; [Fernandez, M.

It draws on Butler, Berlant and Hardt's work on affects, and on feminist contributions to the intersection between school choice, social class and mothering. These contributions help us deepen our understanding of school choice as both a form of passionate attachment to the education market and affective labour. In addition, these perspectives motivate us to go beyond social research sustaining the dominant critical discourse of advantages that middle-classes gain over working-classes through their work in the education market. Our analyses suggest that school choice configures cruel passionate attachments to the education market on middle-class mothers through the construction of working-class others', and models public education as an abject object through the intensification of mothers' affective labour, thus reinforcing their experiences of gendered and affective inequalities.;"[Leyton, Daniel] Univ Sussex, CHEER, Brighton BN1 9QQ, E Sussex, England; [Teresa Rojas, Maria] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Leyton, D (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, CHEER, Brighton BN1 9QQ, E Sussex, England.;D.Leyton@sussex.ac.uk;Leyton, Daniel/ABF-3998-2020;Leyton, Daniel/0000-0003-2472-9835;Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice (CEPPE);This work was supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice (CEPPE) http://www.ceppeuc.cl/.

They try to approximate the quality of schools and the social environment and contrast those with their hopes and fears concerning their child's education. We aim to clarify how the reputations of schools are constructed in Finland and Chile and what sorts of reputational categories, hierarchies and preferences of schools and classes families form when making a choice. Bernstein's instrumental and expressive orders are applied as tools to analyse these reputations from qualitative interview data. The amount and type of expressive order turned out to be the crucial factor when comparing schools' reputations and in the making of choices. While in Chile the expressive-social order in terms of contributing to habitus was seen as the most important factor in constructing school reputations and shaping preferences, in Finland the expressive-personal order in the form of school contentment was highlighted.;"[Kosunen, Sonja] Univ Helsinki, Inst Behav Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Carrasco, Alejandro] Catholic Univ Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Kosunen, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Inst Behav Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Sonja.kosunen@helsinki.fi;;Kosunen, Sonja/0000-0001-8093-7052;"Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Chile";The interviews were conducted by the research group Parents and School Choice: Family Strategies, Segregation and School Policies in Chilean and Finnish Basic Schooling (PASC).

The reform calls for de-municipalization of the public school sector (345 municipal education departments under mayoral control) and the creation of 70 Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica (SLEPs) between 2018 and 2025. The reform represents a largescale attempt to improve and save public education in Chile. This analysis is based on case studies of implementation of the first four SLEPs in the first year of the reform. Using Stake's method for multiple case study analysis, the analysis explores how context influences the professional capacity of the SLEPs to provide professional assistance to schools. The study relates to research on the effectiveness of intermediate level agencies in school systems and on contextual influences on organizational innovation and capacity building. The analysis reveals that contextual factors shaping initial professional capacity of the SLEPs reinforced traditional practices of local education agency support to schools in three of the four cases. The differentiating factor centered on the actions of local agency leaders who responded to capacity gaps and lack of direction from government authorities as either constraints on change or as an opportunity for innovation.;"[Anderson, Stephen] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Anderson, Stephen] OISE Comparat Int & Dev Educ Program & Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Uribe, Mario] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Educ Leaders, Valparaiso, Chile; [Uribe, Mario] Fdn Chile, Sch Management & Leadership Program, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile";;Anderson, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.;steve.anderson@utoronto.ca;;;ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence;The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research funding in Chile from ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence.;;40;2;2;6;16;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

Most studies have used traditional research methods to capture students' perceptions of effective feedback. Little attention has been paid to what emotions are triggered by feedback and when these emotions are elicited. This paper explored feedback using an electronic log (e-log) to capture multiple feedback events experienced by international students. These events were then explored in a semi-structured interview. An account of the development and implementation of the e-log is included in this paper. Using an interpretivist approach, we analysed students' emotional responses to feedback. The role of emotions in feedback and learning is studied from a socio-cultural perspective. Findings revealed students had a range of complex and dynamic emotional responses to feedback. Three case studies are presented to further explore this complexity. Students' emotions were associated with the self, information on feedback messages, or lack of familiarity with feedback practices. Emotions triggered by feedback influenced students' practices and construction of their new identity in the new academic environment.;"[Olave-Encina, Karen; Moni, Karen; Renshaw, Peter] Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Olave-Encina, Karen] Univ Amer, Fac Educ, Vina Del Mar, Chile";;"Olave-Encina, K (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Olave-Encina, K (corresponding author), Univ Amer, Fac Educ, Vina Del Mar, Chile.";karen.olave@uqconnect.edu.au;Olave-Encina, Karen/A-9739-2019;Olave-Encina, Karen/0000-0002-7596-6091;;;;63;3;3;4;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0729-4360;1469-8366;;HIGH EDUC RES DEV;High.

Researchers and science method instructors (SMIs) collaboratively restructured respective science method courses to hold fidelity to an interrelated set of instructional practices that attend to science learning as envisioned in a Framework for K-12 Science Education, while also creating contextualized spaces for language and literacy development targeted to English learners (ELs), but also supportive of mainstream students. We observed the teaching of SMIs and preservice teachers (PSTs) with observation rubrics to gauge the fidelity to which they implemented practices. Across programs, SMIs provided opportunities for PSTs to experience the instructional practices as intended, although there was less opportunity for pedagogical development around them. The strongest evidence of PST fidelity to the intervention was found for two practices: Increasing student interaction and Facilitating student talk. Considerable variation was found across the programs for other practices including some evidence of negative effects. We discuss results in terms of promises for preparing novice secondary science teachers, as well as future directions to overcome challenges that researchers, SMIs, and novice teachers are likely to face when preparing novice science teachers.;"[Lyon, Edward G.] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Curriculum Studies & Secondary Educ, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [Stoddart, Trish; Bunch, George C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Educ Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tolbert, Sara] Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Stud, Tucson, AZ USA; [Salinas, Ivan] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Santiago, Chile; [Solis, Jorge] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Bicultural Bilingual Studies, San Antonio, TX USA";;Lyon, EG (corresponding author), Sonoma State Univ, Dept Curriculum Studies & Secondary Educ, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.;lyone@sonoma.edu;Barrios, Ivan Salinas/I-7485-2018;"Barrios, Ivan Salinas/0000-0002-5675-3920; Tolbert, Sara/0000-0001-5246-7110";National Science Foundation DRK-12 program [1316834];National Science Foundation DRK-12 program, grant #1316834.;;92;9;9;0;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0036-8326;1098-237X;;SCI EDUC;Sci.

Given the inherent dialogical nature of formative assessment in the classroom, video can provide a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing teachers' formative assessment interactions with students. In this study, we provide a framework for examining expertise in formative assessment and use this framework to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the practices of 13 mathematics and science teachers. While we only saw a few instances of true expertise in formative assessment practices in our examination of videos, our findings indicate that teachers with more expertise in formative assessment let students' ideas guide their teaching. This leads to higher correlations among the dimensions of practice that we articulate in our framework for expert teachers. However, because many of the instructional decisions that teachers make are not visible on video, video alone may not provide enough information to judge expertise in formative assessment.;"[Gotwals, Amelia Wenk; Philhower, Joanne; Bennett, Steven] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48843 USA; [Cisterna, Dante] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Gotwals, AW (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, 620 Farm Lane, E Lansing, MI 48843 USA.;gotwals@msu.edu;Cisterna, Dante/D-6429-2016;"Cisterna, Dante/0000-0002-3304-0813; Gotwals, Amelia/0000-0002-7907-8649";Michigan Department of Education;Work on the Formative Assessment for Michigan Educators (FAME) project was supported by the Michigan Department of Education.;;58;19;19;2;44;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

All teachers increased their use of interactive talk structures and the cognitive demand of the talk moves they used while facilitating discussion. At the same time, there was considerable diversity in their improvements. Analyses of interviews and surveys indicate that they adopted pedagogical tools introduced in the PD program.

Influential comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved in these kinds of imposed-etic approaches, such as (1) universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the components' significances, (3) the congruence between languages and conceptions, and (4) the components' coverage of the phenomena. Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We investigate the premise of universality within the examined components by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is simply unjustifiable. We also thoroughly examined the three other premises underpinning the Western-based imposed-etic perspective.;"[Tuohilampi, Laura; Hannula, Markku S.; Laine, Anu; Naveri, Liisa; Salo i Nevado, Laia] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Varas, Leonor; Giaconi, Valentina] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Tuohilampi, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;laura.tuohilampi@helsinki.fi;"Hannula, Markku/AAF-6362-2020; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Nevado, Laia Saló i/AAR-7668-2021; Laine, Anu/AAE-7083-2020";"Laine, Anu/0000-0003-3881-8134; Salo i Nevado, Laia/0000-0002-2773-1167";"bi-national Chile-Finland cooperation project in CONICYT Chile [AKA09]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1135556]; Basal Project Center for Mathematical Modeling, at the University of Chile; Project Center for Advanced Research in Education, at the University of Chile [CIE05]";"This research was partially supported by a bi-national Chile-Finland cooperation project: AKA09 in CONICYT Chile; #1135556 in the Academy of Finland.

The purpose of this study is to describe procedures by which a paper-and-pencil instrument to assess teachers' pedagogical content knowledge for evolution (PCKevo) was developed and validated. The instrument was created to measure the components proposed in the model of Magnusson et al. (1999), except for the orientations. The creation of the questionnaire was carried out through eleven steps: (1) conceptualization, (2-4) creation of items and rubric reviewed by experts (focus on content and construct validity), (5-7) piloting a 32-item questionnaire to 10 biology teachers (focus on face and construct validity and reliability), (8-10) piloting a 16-item questionnaire to 61 biology teachers (focus on discriminant and construct validity and reliability), (11) application of a different instrument (CoRe interview) to four teachers (focus on criterion validity). The final version of the questionnaire (which includes three PCK components) showed in a Rasch analysis for the reliability of the items (alpha = 0.90) and persons (alpha = 0.81) adequate values. When applying the final version of the questionnaire, there is also evidence of discriminant validity (differences between two groups of teachers with or without professional development in evolution education).

For this reason, it seems interesting to review other elements that do not belong to structural factors and that can be addressed by the educational community to support students who live in that reality. There is great evidence of the incidence of variables such as attributive styles, self-regulation strategies, school coexistence and academic self-concept regarding school performance, but a specific and joint analysis of these variables for vulnerable realities could provide clues to educational communities in order to prioritize and implement improvement opportunities. The objective of this work was to examine the joint effect of the aforementioned factors with respect to the academic achievement of middle third and fourth year students from vulnerable Chilean schools. The study involved secondary school students from highly socially vulnerable contexts (N=1498). Four Likert scale surveys were used for data collection, which were applied massively and online. Through the Structural Equations Model, results show that academic self-concept obtained the highest statistical significance (beta=.22; p<.05), followed by self-regulation strategies (beta=.12; p<.05). It was also observed that the indiscipline factor obtained a significant but inverse association (beta=-.22; p<.05) with the grades of the general average of the students. The correlations between the variables were also significant, showing that school performance would have a stronger and positive correlation with self-regulation strategies and academic self-concept. The conclusions focus on the anticipation and prevention of situations of indiscipline, the promotion of a positive academic self-concept and the implementation of specific programs that contribute to improvement in self-regulation strategies; considered as practices or actions located within the scope of action of the educational community.";"[Vera Sagredo, Angelica] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Cerda Etchepare, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Aragon Mendizabal, Estibaliz] Univ Cadiz, Dept Psicol, Cadiz, Spain; [Perez Wilson, Carlos] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Rancagua, Chile";;Sagredo, AV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.;"avera@ucsc.cl; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; estivaliz.aragon@uca.es; carlos.perez@uoh.cl";;;;;;68;0;0;1;1;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Because learning progressions lay out how students' ideas change over a long period of time, learning progressions could help teachers build better understanding of student thinking, appropriate learning goals, and instructional moves for supporting students in developing more sophisticated ideas. In this study, we explored the potential of learning progression-based curriculum materials to support teachers in developing more sophisticated content knowledge (CK) and pedagocial content knowledge (PCK) for teaching about water in environmental systems. Teachers participated in professional development that introduced them to a learning progression for water in environmental systems and curriculum materials based on this learning progression. Teachers completed written assessments of their CK and PCK prior to the workshops and a year later. Analyses showed that teachers who taught lessons using the learning progression-based curriculum materials showed modest increases in CK, knowledge of learning goals, and knowledge of student thinking. These increases were greater than analogous changes evident for teachers who did not use the curriculum materials. However, even among those who implemented the curriculum materials, teachers' post-assessment performance did not yet reflect knowledge for supporting students in developing model-based reasoning about water. These results show that learning progressions have potential for supporting teacher learning, but that the ubiquity of traditional school science discourse may limit their potential for both student and teacher progress toward model-based reasoning.;"[Gunckel, Kristin L.; Salinas, Ivan] Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Covitt, Beth A.] Univ Montana, SpectrUM Discovery Area, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Salinas, Ivan] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Santiago, Chile";;Gunckel, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;kgunckel@email.arizona.edu;Barrios, Ivan Salinas/I-7485-2018;Barrios, Ivan Salinas/0000-0002-5675-3920;National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1020176, DUE-0832173];National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: DRL-1020176 and DUE-0832173;;62;11;11;7;51;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-4308;1098-2736;;J RES SCI TEACH;J.

The quality and long-term commitment of teachers represent related mediators that may help to explain effective and ineffective charter schools. Early findings on the comparative rates of annual turnover-exiting from one's school-appear to show higher turnover in charter schools relative to TPSs. But longitudinal data that allow scholars to track teachers over time remain rare. Little evidence exists on how organizational context may interact with individual teacher characteristics to further explain the propensity to leave one's school. Purpose/Objective: Prior research on teacher turnover focused mostly on whether or not and who leaves. Our research builds on and extends prior studies by investigating not only whether and who but also when a teacher leaves. The phenomenon of our study emphasizes the dynamic nature of teacher exit; namely, we are interested in examining when teachers are at the greatest risk of exiting schools. This dynamic focus marks a departure from the typical teacher turnover analysis in which exit is conceptualized as a status (i.e., exit or not). Population/Participants/Subjects: We used a large sample of elementary (4,788) and secondary teachers (8,467) panel data (from 2002-03 to 2008-09) from the LAUSD. A little over 80% of the teachers in the elementary sample were female, while 61% of the secondary teachers were female. About 40% of the elementary and 47% of the secondary teachers were white. The average years of teaching experience was about two for both elementary and secondary teachers. Special education teachers accounted for 12% of the elementary and 15% of the secondary study sample, respectively. Research Design: We combined event history and multilevel modeling analysis in order to investigate when a teacher exits his or her first assigned school and how organizational membership conditions decision processes at the individual level. Conclusions/Recommendations: The longitudinal and multilevel analysis of teacher turnover supports our theoretical position that organizational dynamics and contextual factors are likely to condition the decision process made at the individual level and thereby influence individual behaviors (i.e., decision to leave a school at certain point in time). This cross-level theoretical perspective adds further support to the argument that focusing on recruiting capable teachers and paying attention to working conditions for long-term staffing stability are aspects of schooling that matter most for student learning, as opposed to a horse-race game (i.e., choice and competition).";"[Newton, Xiaoxia] Univ Massachusetts, Res Methods & Evaluat Educ, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Rivero, Rosario] Univ Diego Portales, Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Fuller, Bruce] Univ Calif Berkeley, Educ & Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dauter, Luke] GreatSchools, Data Sci, Oakland, CA USA";;Newton, XX (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Res Methods & Evaluat Educ, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.;;;;;;;74;1;1;1;11;TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV;NEW YORK;525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA;0161-4681;1467-9620;;TEACH COLL REC;Teach.

Findings indicate that the association between the school's aggregate family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores is much greater in the private-voucher sector than in the public one, resulting in marked socioeconomic stratification of test scores in the Chilean voucher system. We also find that the amount of tuition fees paid by parents in private-voucher schools has no bearing on test scores, after controlling for the socioeconomic makeup of the school. Implications of these findings for educational inequality in the context of a universal voucher system are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe the recruitment process, the FLC meeting structure, our intended outcomes and the challenges we faced in meeting them.;"[Ward, Hsuying C.] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept English Pedag, Antofagasta, Chile; [Selvester, Paula M.] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Educ, Chico, CA 95929 USA";;Ward, HC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept English Pedag, Antofagasta, Chile.;"hward@ucn.cl; pselvester@csuchico.edu";;;;;;22;22;22;3;32;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-5698;1465-3400;;EDUC STUD-UK;Educ.

We compared group and individual feedback, using two technologies: (1) Technology-mediated, Peer-Assisted Learning (TechPALS), which uses wireless handheld technology to structure feedback in small groups as they solve fractions problems and (2) a popular desktop product, which provides feedback to individual students as they solve fractions problems individually. Three elementary schools participated in a randomized controlled experiment conducted in the 2007-2008 school year. Students in the TechPALS condition learned more than did the control group students, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.14 to d = 0.44. Analysis of observational data confirmed that students in the TechPALS condition participated socially in questioning, explaining, and discussing disagreements, whereas students in the individual condition did not. We conclude that an integration of technology, cooperative activity designs and broader educational practices can lead to impact on students' mathematics learning.;"[Roschelle, Jeremy; Rafanan, Ken; Bhanot, Ruchi; Estrella, Gucci; Penuel, Bill] SRI Int, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Claro, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Roschelle, J (corresponding author), SRI Int, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;jeremy.roschelle@sri.com;"Roschelle, Jeremy/AAJ-6292-2020; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";"Roschelle, Jeremy/0000-0003-2219-0506; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Claro, Susana/0000-0001-5168-4164";;;;59;52;53;2;22;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1629;;;ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES;ETR&D-Educ.

One of the proposals has been to reuse Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) as Small Online Private Courses (SPOCs), or as complementary resources in traditional courses through blended learning practices, such as flipped classroom. However, the integration of online courses as a complement to face-to-face courses poses some challenges. First, students are not used to such blended learning approaches and it is generally difficult for teachers to motivate them to access online resources for the preparation of face-to-face sessions. Second, students are not used to the dynamics of blended learning scenarios, which are less teacher-centered and require their active participation. We propose the use of the mobile application MyMOOCSpace (MMS) to meet these challenges and increase students' motivation and use of learning resources in blended learning courses that use SPOCs as a complement. MMS is a mobile learning application based on gamification mechanisms to promote collaboration and motivation of students in the use of digital resources as a complement to blended learning courses. In this paper, we present the results of a quasi-experiment in a blended course with 294 students that uses a SPOC as a complement, with the aim to assess the effect of MMS on students' motivation and learning resources consumption. In particular, the behavior of two groups of students with the main digital resources of the SPOC (videos and formative assessments) was analyzed: one using the MMS (GTest group), and the other not using MMS (GTrad group). The results suggest that the use of MMS had a positive correlation with the videos consumption, besides increasing student' interaction with assessment exercises in the SPOC.;"[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres; Hilliger, Isabel; Rojos, Felipe] Pontificia Catolica Univ Chile, Ciencias Computac, Macul, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Ingn Telemat, Madrid, Spain";;Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Catolica Univ Chile, Ciencias Computac, Macul, Chile.;llramirez@uc.cl;"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/K-3451-2014; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963";"PROF-XXI [609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; InnovaT [598758-EPP-1-2018-1-AT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161264]; eMadrid Network [P2018/TCS-4307]; FEDEREuropean Commission [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; LALA Project [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins, Santiago's grant [1000/532/14]; Corfo 2030 Project [14ENI2-26862]";"This work was supported by PROF-XXI: [Grant Number 609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; InnovaT: [Grant Number 598758-EPP-1-2018-1-AT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Conicyt: [Grant Number 21161264]; eMadrid Network: [Grant Number P2018/TCS-4307]; FEDER -Project Smartlet: [Grant Number TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; LALA Project: [Grant Number 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins, Santiago's grant: [Grant Number UBO ` H Rect.

However, in education, there is extensive evidence about the negative effects of predominant accountability systems, which call their expected positive impacts into question. Some of the detrimental effects of these systems involve unequal distribution of knowledge as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of vulnerable students, minorities and powerless groups, and of the schools that serve them. This evidence, along with emerging demands for social justice in terms of participation and recognition, highlights the need to analyse the shortcomings of current accountability systems in connection to ideals of social justice in education. On the basis of a review of relevant literature that connects the areas of social justice, education and assessment and accountability systems, this paper aims at illustrating some of the significant challenges and potential new avenues for the development of more just and, therefore, more intelligent accountability systems.;"[Florez Petour, Maria Teresa; Rozas Assael, Tamara] Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Rozas Assael, Tamara] Inst Educ UCL, London, England";;Petour, MTF (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile.;"mtflorez@u.uchile.cl; tamarindo.rozas@gmail.com";;;CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [REDES 170112];"Funding was provided by CONICYT for the project A network of research centres around assessment and social justice; SLATE, CIESAS and the Centre for Studies on Educational Assessment (Grant No. REDES 170112).";;96;4;6;1;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1389-2843;1573-1812;;J EDUC CHANG;J.

Problems reported by novice public school principals (n = 94) were compared to those reported by their more experienced peers (n = 120). Data were gathered through an online survey and eight in-depth interviews. Findings showed that groups did not differ in the overall pattern of responses when problems were categorized at the system level (45%), interactions with people (33%), at the school and territory levels (15%), and within themselves (7%). Differences were observed when comparing the extent to which each group reported problems managing up (interactions with the municipal department of education and Ministry of Education) and managing down (initiating changes in the school's culture and structures). The high frequency and types of problems reported at the system level indicate the need to align policy reforms addressing leadership practices at intermediate and school levels. The findings also suggest guidelines for the professional development programs that extend beyond normative practices for effective school leadership, by also responding to country specific social and organizational structures.;"[Montecinos, Carmen; Aravena, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bush, Tony] Univ Nottingham, Sch Educ, Nottingham, England";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848;"CONICYT-FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140906]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 003]";We are grateful for the funding provided by CONICYT-FONDECYT Grant # 1140906 and CONICYT FB 003;;72;14;16;6;17;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0738-0593;1873-4871;;INT J EDUC DEV;Int.

We analyzed their answers from TEDS-M 2008 future teachers' questionnaires in order to establish the knowledge that was necessary to correctly answer the questions that assessed the conceptual domain of numbers and the knowledge involved when they were answered incorrectly. We classified the results based on the type of numerical problem posed, the level of curricular content involved and the cognitive domain assessed by each question. We found that Spanish future primary teachers had sufficient knowledge of the primary and lower secondary content questions with the exception of working with the concepts of reason / proportion / percentage and the translation of a simple subtraction of fractions into a word problem. Even though they reported knowing about the density of irrational numbers, Spanish future teachers showed insufficient knowledge of advanced mathematics content. Since teachers' mathematical knowledge influences the numerical literacy of students, these results can be useful for the design of the syllabi of the Primary Teacher Grade in Spain.;"[Gutierrez Gutierrez, Araceli] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Rico, Luis] Univ Granada, Dept Didact Matemat, Fac Ciencias Educ, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Gomez, Pedro] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile";;Gutierrez, AG (corresponding author), C Santo Tomas de Villanueva 36, Granada 18004, Spain.;"araceligtgt@gmail.com; argeifontes@gmail.com; lrico@ugr.es";Rico, Luis/A-6616-2016;"Rico, Luis/0000-0002-0366-5425; Gomez, Pedro/0000-0001-9929-4675";;;;23;4;4;1;15;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Some responses produce real, broad increases in learning, but other responses can raise reported test scores without increasing learning. We estimate the effect of an accountability program on reading scores and math scores in Chile. Over a 6-year period, fourth-grade reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, on average, and half the rise was due to the accountability program. However, many schools, especially schools serving disadvantaged students, inflated their accountability ratings by having low-performing students miss high-stakes tests. To encourage healthier responses to accountability, we recommend setting accountability goals that are attainable for schools with disadvantaged students, and providing incentives for all students to take high-stakes tests.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile.;"alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com; paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com";;;;;;37;1;1;0;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1874-8597;1874-8600;;EDUC ASSESS EVAL ACC;Educ.

Differences have been demonstrated between students who receive education in this area from an early age and those who do not. However, not enough work has been done to measure these skills in a classroom setting. Given that the best time to teach critical thinking is during the first years of primary education, we designed a test to determine the level of critical thinking among 3rd and 4th grade students in Language Arts using a graphic novel. We showed the legitimacy of the instrument through Construct Validity, Content Validity, Pearson product-moment correlation, Reliability and Item Analysis. Using the instrument, we studied how critical thinking skills differ among 3rd grade students, according to their socioeconomic status (SES), studying schools with low, middle and high SES. We found significant differences between the schools, which suggest that there may be a relationship between socioeconomic status and the development of critical thinking skills. The test presented in this study is an improvement on existing assessment tools as it replaces unidimensional models with models that provide a more detailed and multidimensional picture of student learning.

Although there has been extensive relevant research, it is not clear enough how oral argumentation spontaneously occurs in science teaching. This is particularly important with regard to the empirical evidence suggesting the effect of discussion of contradictory views on scientific learning. In order to contribute to the research on argumentation in science teaching, we conducted a study that aims to sketch a panoramic view of the uses of oral argumentation in Chilean middle-school science teaching. A total of 153 videotaped science lessons were observed, involving students aged 10-11 and 12-13. Whole-class argumentative discourse was analysed as a function of thematic episodes and teachers' and students' utterances. Results suggest that argumentative discourse in which contradictory points of view are discussed is scarce but when it occurs it does so predominantly within discourse among students. On the contrary, argumentation aimed at justifying points of view is widely used, even more so when students are older.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago 8340575, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago 8340575, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;"Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231";;;;54;17;24;4;49;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

In such scenarios, telecollaboration and virtual exchange have gained increased attention as powerful pedagogical strategies to allow for the continuity of intercultural exchanges and understanding the trends of this growing field can be of high significance to practitioners when planning future related initiatives. Although telecollaboration and virtual exchange are not new phenomena, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough bibliometric study of the area, considering the characteristics of its publications and its scientific community, has not yet been developed. This study carried out a bibliometric analysis of the telecollaboration and virtual exchange research field using a set of 254 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases with the objective of characterising the area as well as identifying research tendencies. In particular, this study uses four analytical scientometric tools: co-citation, co-authorship, keywords co-occurrence analysis and identification of research trends. This study identified emerging and declining themes in the field of telecollaboration and virtual exchange, confirming that the practice is increasingly adopting diverse formats and cutting across different knowledge fields. In addition, results showed that international collaboration so far involves few countries and there is much space to widen co-authorship networks to enhance intercultural exchanges.

To address this discrepancy, Teach, an open-access classroom observation tool, was developed to measure the quality of teaching practices of primary school teachers in low-and-middle-income countries. This paper uses data from Punjab, Pakistan to evaluate the validity of Teach.

Yet graduation and persistence rates remain low. One way to improve graduation and persistence is to use data and analytics to identify students at risk of dropout, target interventions, and evaluate interventions' effectiveness at improving student success. We illustrate the potential of this approach using data from eight Chilean universities. Results show that data available at matriculation are only weakly predictive of persistence, while prediction improves dramatically once data on university grades become available. Some predictors of persistence are under policy control. Financial aid predicts higher persistence, and being denied a first-choice major predicts lower persistence. Student success programmes are ineffective at some universities; they are more effective at others, but when effective they often fail to target the highest risk students. Universities should use data regularly and systematically to identify high-risk students, target them with interventions, and evaluate those interventions' effectiveness.";"[Von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile.;alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com;;;Universidad de La Frontera;This work was supported by the Universidad de La Frontera [Apoyo Pasantias En El Extranjero Para Investigadores/As Ufro].;;34;7;7;5;12;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-080X;1469-9508;;J HIGH EDUC POLICY M;J.

Concerned about first year failures among first-generation students, a university in Chile devised a between-semesters course intended to allow failed students to remain with their entering class. The course had three major elements: compression of a semester's course work into 2 weeks; use of incentives to motivate students to prepare for classes; and flipped class participation. In 2014, this intensive course was offered in the break between the first and second semesters. Some 310 students in Health Sciences who had failed at least one of three required courses were invited to enroll; 140 signed up.

However, these reforms are tied to two different realities that conflict with each other: a formative reality, which promotes a school climate of local decision-making and the improvement of school performance; and a punitive reality, which prioritizes improvement in the school climate through accountability protocols and regulations. We used Actor-Network Theory to describe the network of actors that underlie these realities. We analyzed key documents and conducted active interviews with actors responsible for the design and implementation of these policies. Results show that the assembled network enacts an accountability reality by means of the Law on Assurance of the Quality of Education, with key devices and s-objects performing the network. However, this enacted reality is at odds with a logic of school improvement that is still defended by the Ministry of Education, an actor that is no longer the main source of translation in the network. These results are discussed in light of the so-called global triumph of New Public Management through the dissemination of specific instruments that bring together subjects and objects in enacting the reality of accountability.";"[Lopez, Veronica; Sisto, Vicente; Gloria Nunez, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Sisto, Vicente] TRASAS, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Baleriola, Enrique] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Garcia, Antonio] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Carrasco, Claudia] Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdes, Rene] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdes, Rene] Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.;veronica.lopez@pucv.cl;"Baleriola, Enrique/AAG-6291-2019; Valdes, Rene/AAW-3894-2021; Carrasco, Claudia/AAF-6848-2021; Lopez, Veronica/K-5472-2014";"Baleriola, Enrique/0000-0003-2899-6316; Valdes, Rene/0000-0003-4242-9748; Carrasco, Claudia/0000-0002-8768-2440; Lopez, Veronica/0000-0001-7405-3859";"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1191267, 1140960, 1191015, 11190195]; PIA CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [160009]";Funding was received from FONDECYT 1191267, FONDECYT 1140960, FONDECYT 1191015, FONDECYT 11190195, and PIA CONICYT 160009.;;42;2;2;3;13;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

Five postgraduate students and five teacher educators from three different Masters of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (MTEFL) programs agreed to take part in the research. Informed by a qualitative paradigm, semi-structured interviews were conducted aimed mainly at (1) unpacking teacher educators' and postgraduate students' understandings of CT; (2) investigating postgraduates' views of the place of critical thinking in their English teacher education training; (3) examining the ways in which teacher educators deal with CT in their pedagogies; and (4) identifying students' preparedness to approach reading and writing critically, as viewed by both groups of participants. Analysis of responses revealed, on the one hand, students' recognition of CT skills as necessary to succeed in academic life and, on the other, great concerns for the limited importance accorded to teaching these skills in teacher education courses. Teacher educators' responses generally showed an increasing interest in trying to incorporate the teaching of CT skills in their pedagogies, but admitted to an overall lack of consistency in the implementation process. The paper concludes with critical questions about the perceived pedagogical mismatches between teacher educators' and postgraduate students' perceptions of the role of CT in their academic journeys, and about the role of Chilean teacher education programs in addressing these issues.";"[Veliz, Leonardo] Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Veliz-Campos, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile";;Veliz, L (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.;leonardo.v@deakin.edu.au;Veliz, Leonardo/ABH-9324-2020;;;;;52;3;4;5;43;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1356-2517;1470-1294;;TEACH HIGH EDUC;Teach.

We designed and implemented an early intervention program to encourage children's emotional competence through adult-mediated reading of children's literature. Ninety-two children (6-8 years old) participated and were divided into three groups. We implemented a pre-post quasi-experimental design with two quasi-control groups. We measured facial emotion recognition, empathy, and emotional lability as dependent variables. Results indicate that the experimental group scored the best in all dimensions.

Their identities, however, are not entirely of their own making. Through a qualitative study, and deploying a social realist perspective, this paper analyses academic identities in Chile and attempts to locate the patterns of identity in the context of a marketised higher education system. The data were collected in both a state and a private university. The results suggest that distinct kinds of fragilities may be emerging among Chilean academics (ontological and contractual fragilities). These two fragilities can be traced to the attendant structures of the university system at an institutional level (reputational fragility in the public sector and a branding fragility in the private sector). The paper concludes by observing that, although the power of the structures is considerable, there are still spaces for agentic responses.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso Chile, Valparaiso, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso Chile, Sch Psychol, Fac Med, Ave Brasil 2140, Valparaiso, Chile.;carolina.guzman@uv.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;;;;40;20;22;0;23;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0007-1005;1467-8527;;BRIT J EDUC STUD;Br.

However, the concept has not yet been sufficiently researched in tertiary educational settings, and in this case, specifically in Chilean higher education. This paper explores whether toxic leadership was present in country's universities and, if so, to assess its impact over academics' work engagement. A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted, using a sample of 592 academics from two different Chilean universities, who voluntarily responded to two validated scales: One to measure toxic leadership perceptions (Schmidt's toxic leadership scale) and other one to measure work engagement (UWES(R) work engagement scale). The results corroborated the presence of toxic leadership in the consulted institutions, but a significant relationship between this style of leadership and work engagement was not established. This finding suggests that, even though the participants recognise the presence of toxic leadership, work engagement was not necessarily affected by their leader's behaviour.;"[Klahn Acuna, Blanca] Univ Concepcion, Periodont & Implantol, Concepcion, Chile; [Male, Trevor] UCL Inst Educ, Ctr Educ Leadership, London, England";;"Acuna, BK (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dent Fac, Concepcion 8370146, Chile.; Acuna, BK (corresponding author), UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.";blancaklahn@gmail.com;;;;;;42;0;0;0;0;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

We analysed a national database that includes measures taken in 2007, 2011, and 2013 from a same sample of over 140,000 students. Multilevel-growth models were used to analyse the trajectories, and linear adjustment with propensity score matching was used to control for confounding variables. We found positive effects of voucher education on intercepts which, after controlling for schools' socioeconomic composition and selection policies, became irrelevant in terms of effect sizes. Regarding slopes, voucher schools have a significant positive effect, which is irrelevant in terms of effect sizes if 1 year is considered, but relevant for a 12-year school trajectory.

The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics - using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity - to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom. However, the boundaries between researchers and science teachers should consider the cultural worlds of participants in the partnerships.;"[Guerrero, Gonzalo R.; Reiss, Michael J.] UCL Inst Educ, London, England; [Guerrero, Gonzalo R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Unidad Innovac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Guerrero, GR (corresponding author), 3 Barton Close, Cambridge CB3 9LQ, England.;g.hernandez@ucl.ac.uk;Reiss, Michael/P-8205-2017;"Reiss, Michael/0000-0003-1207-4229; Guerrero, Gonzalo/0000-0002-7207-4880";;;;56;3;3;4;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

In this article we present an approach to this problem from the classroom practice, describing and analysing some aspects of the content and nature of the knowledge of two primary school teachers when working on the measurement of time with their students. We have adopted a qualitative methodology, and three moments of the teachers' interventions have been considered as a reflective action research cycle: for practice, in practice and on practice. To this end, planning and intervention sessions have been recorded for two primary school teachers and their actions have been interpreted in consideration of the analytical model Mathematics Teachers' Specialised Knowledge (MTSK). This analysis has revealed that teachers are aware of the complexity of dealing with the reading and recording of time when they plan their intervention, and therefore they recognize the need to teach how to use the clock. Our first findings point out the need to provide the students with references for the units of time and to emphasize the functioning of the measuring instrument, questioning the usefulness of the analogue clock.;"[Pizarro, Noetni] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Miguel Belmonte, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Fac Educ, Ctr Formac Profesorado, Rector Royo Villanova S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala de Henares, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala, Dept Fis & Matemat, Campus Univ, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain";;Pizarro, N (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile.;"noemi.pizarro@umce.c1; belmonte@ucm.es; blanca.arteaga@uah.es";Arteaga-Martínez, Blanca/G-4802-2016;Arteaga-Martínez, Blanca/0000-0002-1079-1526;;;;35;0;0;1;10;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Scientific texts are conceptually and linguistically complex, especially for students from low-income contexts because they have neither the experience with the language nor the literacy skills to face the challenges of scientific knowledge. This study used a mix method approach to compare the cognitive scaffolding practiced by teachers during science reading activities in high- and low-performing schools. Three teachers and 141 fourth grade students from low socioeconomic background schools participated in 48 class sessions. Classes were video-recorded and transcribed. The data were analyzed using Sanchez' Pedagogic Practice Analysis System. The results show that teachers from both types of schools continuously use reading as a tool for learning. The effective teacher uses reading with non-invasive scaffolding and varied verbal participation to elaborate knowledge, promoting literal and inferential comprehension and more opportunities for the students to construct knowledge. By contrast, less effective teachers use reading with invasive scaffolding and little verbal participation of the students to consolidate knowledge, promoting mainly literal comprehension. This study shed light on different approaches teachers use to foster reading comprehension for science learning.;"[Rojas Rojas, Sandra Patricia] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Dept Ciencias Ambiente, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363,Estac Cent, Santiago, Chile; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Sanchez Miguel, Emilio] Univ Salamanca, Dept Psicol, Salamanca, Spain";;Rojas, SPR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Dept Ciencias Ambiente, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363,Estac Cent, Santiago, Chile.;sandra.rojas.r@usah.cl;"ROJAS, SANDRA PATRICIA ROJAS/AAU-5018-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017";"ROJAS, SANDRA PATRICIA ROJAS/0000-0001-6284-5373; Sanchez Miguel, Emilio/0000-0001-8157-9824";"Proyect DICYT, Departamento de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (DICYT) [031941]; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile; FONDECYT, CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150332]";The study was sponsored by Proyect DICYT 031941 RR, Departamento de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (DICYT), Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile and FONDECYT REGULAR 1150332, CONICYT, Chile.;;50;3;3;1;26;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

The study compares the conceptions of teachers from these two countries which share a similar recent history and have both experienced strong movements of popular protest and political detachment. The methodology was qualitative and made use of semi-structured interviews. The study analysed dialogues from 70 teachers, 35 in each country. The initial results indicate a predominance of moral and participatory conceptions of citizenship, to the detriment of legal or identity-based conceptions. The controversial political, social and economic context of both countries within which the interviews were conducted is a key factor to understanding the teachers' perspectives on their conceptions and the meaning of these.;"[Martinez-Rodriguez, Rosendo; Sanchez-Agusti, Maria] Valladolid Univ, Valladolid, Spain; [Munoz-Labrana, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";;Martinez-Rodriguez, R (corresponding author), Valladolid Univ, Valladolid, Spain.;"rosendo.martinez@uva.es; almagosa@sdcs.uva.es; carlosem@udec.cl";"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/F-2103-2015; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/R-5186-2018";"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/0000-0001-7163-3276; Munoz, Carlos/0000-0003-2044-1965; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/0000-0003-3816-0432";;;;58;1;1;0;3;UNISA PRESS;PRETORIA;PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA;1682-3206;1947-9417;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

This is particularly evident through multimodal composition and collaboration in primary classrooms. Over two decades ago, the New London Group argued that all meaning-making is multimodal. By representing their knowledge through multiple modes and for local and global audiences, students can express their identity, exercise agency, and foster a sense of authoring through multimodal production.;"[Thibaut, Patricia] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Social Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Curwood, Jen Scott] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Educ & Social Work, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia";;Thibaut, P (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Social Sci, Valdivia, Chile.;patricia.thibaut@uach.cl;;Thibaut, Patricia/0000-0003-2990-0339;Becas Chile scholarship programme - Chilean government;This study was supported by the Becas Chile scholarship programme sponsored by the Chilean government.;;24;14;14;1;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0040-5841;1543-0421;;THEOR PRACT;Theory Pract.;;2018;57;1;;;;;48;55;;10.1080/00405841.2017.1392202;;;8;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;FU2LP;WOS:000423682000007;;;;;2022-04-06;

Based on a three-year mixed method design, we use qualitative comparative analysis to investigate the influence of combinations of conditions on the depth of discussion. Results suggest that there were three conditions associated with the extent to which Cl members engaged in discussions with substantive interaction and reflection: a clear purpose, coach questioning, and the connection of theory to practice.

To reach these objectives, we selected a sample of 20 teachers (10 men and 10 women) from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, considered competent and experienced teachers, and they answered an in-depth interview to give us an account of their declared teacher identity. After a content analysis of the interviews, the study concludes by showing that: a) in general terms, the competence profile model is confirmed, but the deeper sense and significance that these competences have to participants is conflictive. We identified five thematic spaces that posed discrepancies and conflicts with the theoretical model; b) the participants have clear regularities in the way of conceiving and coping with teaching in university classrooms.

Results show that the availability of basic infrastructure and services (water, electricity, sewage), didactic facilities (sport installations, labs, libraries), as well as the number of books in the library and computers in the school do have an effect on the achievement of primary education students in Latin America, but their relative weight varies significantly from country to country.

Latent Class analysis, based on conventional demographic and current activity data, was used to classify these students into four distinct groups. The groups varied in their level of satisfaction (or engagement) with the Second Opportunity School in which they were studying. Within each School, the groups' satisfaction varied according to the activities in which students participated.

The students declare to make a didactic use of the networks and their tools and, at the same time, they recognize the collaborative work as a methodology that promotes their learning and that is fostered by the use of the DSN. Among the purposes of the following study, we find the question of the perceptions that students have regarding the use of social networks as an educational tool and to know their preferences regarding collaborative work. The research carried out falls within the so-called ex post facto, not experimental and descriptive. The sample of the research was formed by 460 students who studied different degrees in the engineering area of a Chilean higher education institution, during the 2017-18 academic year. Among the remarkable results, we can affirm that the Internet is presenting itself as one of the technologies that is penetrating more strongly in the Universities, and that the students use it constantly for educational purposes. It is for these reasons that we consider that there are initial conditions for the incorporation of social networks to formal education. In addition, our results show that the interest to work with other students determines the attitude of students towards collaborative work.

Relating participants' performance and contributions;JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"contributions; learning analytics; MOOC; performance; social tools";"SYSTEMS; METRICS";The role of social tools in massive open online courses (MOOCs) is essential as they connect participants. Of all the participants in an MOOC, top contributors are the ones who more actively contribute via social tools. This article analyses and reports empirical data from five different social tools pertaining to an actual MOOC to characterize top contributors and provide some insights aimed at facilitating their early detection. The results of this analysis show that top contributors have better final scores than the rest. In addition, there is a moderate positive correlation between participants' overall performance (measured in terms of final scores) and the number of posts submitted to the five social tools. This article also studies the effect of participants' gender and scores as factors that can be used for the early detection of top contributors. The analysis shows that gender is not a good predictor and that taking the scores of the first assessment activities of each type (test and peer assessment in the case study) results in a prediction that is not substantially improved by adding subsequent activities. Finally, better predictions based on scores are obtained for aggregate contributions in the five social tools than for individual contributions in each social tool.;"[Alario-Hoyos, C.; Munoz-Merino, P.

A fourth factor, students' knowledge about university, is also examined, extending the TPB. The research model tested used the responses of a survey of 620 school students from remote and regional areas in New South Wales, Australia.

In each of both countries, over two thousand teachers of all school levels and types were surveyed during a two-month period on their professional experiences in the first year of remote teaching. The article discusses teacher accounts of how their work changed, their difficulties, impact on well-being, as well as new professional learning brought about by the challenges involved. Conceptually, the study relied on notions of occupational professionalism, self-efficacy perceptionsand collegial support in challenging circumstances. Results in both countries highlighted an impact on teacher occupational professionalism and self-efficacy perceptions, mainly brought about by intermittent levels of engagement of students during remote teaching sessions, and difficulties in carrying out proper assessments of student learning. Student well-being was of greater concern to teachers than their own problems, despite feeling the stressful effect of much longer daily working hours, more so among Chilean than Portuguese teachers. The study also brought out teachers' imaginative efforts and the use of unaccustomed pedagogic strategies to reach out to students and insure some level of learning, especially among those without internet connectivity.;"[Avalos, Beatrice; Araneda, Sebastian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Maria Assuncao] Univ Minho, Inst Educ, Res Ctr Child Studies, Braga, Portugal";;Avalos, B (corresponding author), Alsacia 150,Dept 33 Las Condes, Santiago 7550073, Chile.;bavalos254@gmail.com;;;"PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/00317/2020, UIDP700317/2020]";"This work was supported by the PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB003 [Project FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [Project UIDB/00317/2020 and UIDP700317/2020].";;36;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1354-0602;1470-1278;;TEACH TEACH;Teach.

Corequisite math courses provide opportunities for underprepared students to develop their basic math skills through simultaneous enrollment in college-level and developmental courses. However, adding the additional developmental course also increases students' academic workload, potentially impeding their progress early in their college journey. Our study explores the effects of being assigned to this additional developmental math class at one of the largest technical colleges in Chile. Few remedial studies have examined the effects of corequisite courses in the technical college context, either in the United States or abroad. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that for students attending a technical college and scoring close to the cutoff on a standardized mathematics placement exam, being assigned to a corequisite math course increases the grades in their college-level math course and marginally decreases their likelihood of withdrawing during the first semester, compared to students assigned to a single college-level math course. The effects on credits earned and first semester grades are driven by those pursuing less advanced technical degrees.;"[Boatman, Angela] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Claro, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Metropolitan Re, Chile; [Fresard, Matias] Duoc UC, Santiago, Metropolitan Re, Chile; [Kramer, Jenna W.] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA USA";;Boatman, A (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.;"angela.boatman@bc.edu; sclaro@gmail.com; mfresard@fen.uchile.cl; jkramer@rand.org";;Claro, Susana/0000-0001-5168-4164;;;;58;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0361-0365;1573-188X;;RES HIGH EDUC;Res.

Purpose: This study explores the conceptualisation and practice of the use of Big Ideas of science education by primary and secondary teachers in Chile. Sample: A total of 63 science teachers (a purposive sample) from pre-school, primary and secondary education in Valparaiso Region in Chile participated in the study, with 38 of them answering all the questions in the research instrument and 25 answering some of them. Design and methods: The research instrument was a questionnaire with open-ended questions. Results: The use of Big Ideas was seen as the 'natural way' to teach science, mostly related to the students' daily lives. Many of the teachers had their own understanding of Big Ideas. They were very positive about Big Ideas, seeing them as a possible way of connecting with the daily lives of students and facilitating progression in students' learning of science. The teachers also saw Big Ideas as enabling students to work collaboratively and make links between different parts of the curriculum, helping them to understand how science works, and preferable to having to teach an overloaded science curriculum that lacks such an organising framework. Conclusion: The teachers were more interested in their own creation and development of Big Ideas rather than simply adopting the existing, official published framework and adhering to what is said in the Chilean curriculum regarding the approach of Big Ideas. These results indicate the need to explore in-depth such varied conceptualisations of schoolteachers regarding the approach of Big Ideas.

We maintain that globalisation operates as a way to reason about space that produces images and narratives of universities, knowledge and students. We focus our analysis on curriculum reform as a way universities materialise the seemingly abstract economic logic of the so-called 'knowledge society' at the level of student-citizens, who are to be educated to become economic globalisation's next agents. In order to locate curriculum's productive role within university respatialisation, we offer a discourse analysis of the circulation of ideas about globalisation and higher education through intergovernmental and national documents, which take material form in a US state university system's attempted curricular reform of its general education core.

Recently, the Chilean Congress passed Law # 20.027 of 2005, which provides the legal framework for the creation of a student loan system guaranteed both by the State and by higher education institutions (HEIs), financed by the private capital market through the securitization of the loans. The system operated for the first time in 2006, where approximately 21,000 students were able to access financing of their higher education for the remainder of their careers. It is expected that as the system matures, more and better information will be available, which will benefit the students and the HEIs; and it is highly likely that the current number of financed students could grow significantly in the next few years.

Our objective was to analyze the actions, based on dialogue, developed by the level teacher and her collaborators during classes with Interactive Groups. A qualitative design with communicative methodology was used. Data collection instruments were interviews, observations and focus groups. For data analysis, content analysis was employed. In this article, we will show the analysis of the actions arising from the deductive dialogue category oriented towards the inductive (emerging) egalitarian dialogue category. We conclude that dialogue actions such as listen closely, give equal participation opportunities, and accept arguments which contribute helped establish egalitarian dialogue in the classroom between the teacher and the collaborators with the children. This implied that, progressively, horizontal relations were established in the classroom, where the opinions and contributions of children were accepted based on arguments, since egalitarian dialogue is not directed by power relations.;"[Nunez Solis, Marcela] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Nunez Solis, Marcela] Univ Concepcion, Dept Didact Curriculum & Evaluat, Concepcion, Chile; [Murillo Estepa, Paulino] Univ Seville, Dept Didact & Educ Org, Seville, Spain; [Nunez Solis, Marcela] Juan Antonio Coloma 0201, Los Angeles 4440000, Chile; [Murillo Estepa, Paulino] Calle Pirotecnia Sin, Seville 41013, Spain";;Solis, MN (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Didact Curriculum & Evaluat, Concepcion, Chile.;"marcenun@udec.cl; paulino@us.es";;;;;;30;1;1;7;9;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2210-6561;2210-657X;;LEARN CULT SOC INTER;Learn.

Content analysis of focus group interview transcripts evidenced three school-level patterns of participation, associated with distinct goal orientations. Projective participation to judge the quality of the school's practices was associated with a learning orientation (one school). Consultant participation to demonstrate competence to external inspectors was associated with a performance-approach orientation (one school). Simple participation to complete tasks imposed by administrators was associated with a performance-avoidance orientation (four schools). School-level differences highlighted teachers' perceptions of the characteristics of their school's culture associated with the adoption of these goal orientations. These included existing internal accountability practices, the social capital the school could leverage to implement self-assessment and use external feedback, and the existing structures for teacher participation in decision making. These factors may prove to be a useful guide for the development of induction strategies to support the use of school assessment in ways that foster, rather than diminish, teachers' motivation.;"[Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Coll Philosophy & Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Madrid, Romina] Univ Minnesota, Dept Org Leadership Policy & Dev, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Fernandez, Maria Beatriz] Boston Coll, Dept Teacher Educ Special Educ Curriculum & Instr, Lynch Sch Educ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Coll Philosophy & Educ, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.;"carmen.montecinos@ucv.cl; rominamadrid@gmail.com; mariabeatriz.fernandez@gmail.com; lahumada@ucv.cl";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Fernández, M.

The results: Barely one-third of Latin American sixth graders have a computer in their home, and schools where these children attend are unable to reverse this. Furthermore, there is a marked deficit of computers at home and schools in rural areas. Data shows that school performance in reading and math increases significantly among those students that have a computer in their home, an increase that is greater among those students that have at their disposal > 10 computers at school. In turn, increased use, both by pupils and teachers, improves school performance in both disciplines once the following variables are controlled: socio-economic level, family culture, gender, mother tongue and number of pre-school years.;"[Roman Carrasco, Marcela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Ctr Educ Res & Dev CIDE, Santiago, Chile; [Murillo Torrecilla, F.

Desirable outputs of educational achievement and undesirable outputs of educational inequality are considered jointly as result variables. A construct that captures the quality and quantity of educational resources consumed is used as resource variables. Similarly, environmental variables of each educational system are included in the efficiency evaluation model; while these resources are not controllable by the managers of the education systems, they do affect outcomes. We find that European countries are characterized by weak management, the Americans (mainly Latin Americans) by a weak endowment of resources, and the Asians by a high level of heterogeneity. In particular, Asia combines countries with optimal systems (South Korea and Macao-China); countries with managerial problems (Hong Kong, China-Taipei, Japan and Israel); others where the main challenge is the weak endowment of resources (Jordan and Kyrgyzstan), and, finally, others where the main problem is in the long run since it concerns structural conditions of a socioeconomic and cultural nature (Turkey, Thailand, and Indonesia).";"[Thieme, Claudio] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Santiago, Chile; [Gimenez, Victor; Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Empresa, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain";;Thieme, C (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Av Manuel Rodriguez S 253, Santiago, Chile.;claudio.thieme@udp.cl;"Giménez-García, Víctor/AAD-3435-2019; Thieme, Claudio/AAB-9236-2020";"Giménez-García, Víctor/0000-0002-5792-0735; Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861";;;;29;22;22;6;77;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1598-1037;1876-407X;;ASIA PAC EDUC REV;Asia Pac.

J;Vaillant, D;;;;Vaillant, Denise;;;Training of Secondary School teachers. Realities and discourses;REVISTA DE EDUCACION;;;Spanish;Article;;;;;;"teachers; training; Secondary Education; competences; educational policies";;The training of Secondary School teachers is currently an issue under great debate, both in Europe and Latin America. In the latter, the focus has been historically placed on Primary and Higher Education, whereas the key role of Secondary Education in promoting development and improving the quality of life of citizens has often been underestimated. This is strongly related to teacher training, an issue which has acquired certain relevance in the educational discourse. However, it has not been yet subject to substantive and systematical innovation and reforms. There is a significant incongruence between current learning necessities, the requirements of young people and competences acquired by Secondary School teachers once they finish their professional training. The author of this article suggests the need of considering teacher training in a broader sense, emphasizing the importance of developing a solid general training marked by contextualized humanistic, scientific and technological issues. The focus of the article is placed on pre-service training of teachers while acknowledging that the solution cannot be restricting to the development of adequate competences and capacities in teachers. The problem in hands is of greater complexity and is related to changes in young culture and the articulation with other teaching policies.;"[Vaillant, Denise] Univ ORT, Catedrat Polit Educ, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Vaillant, Denise] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Vaillant, Denise] GTD PREAL Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay";;Vaillant, D (corresponding author), Univ ORT, Catedrat Polit Educ, Br Espana 2633, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay.;vaillant@ort.edu.uy;Vaillant, Denise/F-6853-2015;Vaillant Alcalde, Denise/0000-0001-8110-4634;;;;21;14;19;0;10;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;;;REV EDUC;Rev.

The proposed approach, based on project and problem based learning and ill-structured problem solving, was analyzed in the context of competence development and implications for engineering educators. The results of our action research indicate that the generic competences that were found to be significantly fostered were: systems thinking, ambiguity tolerance, asking questions, solving ill-structured problems, ability to apply knowledge in practice, presentation and generating new ideas. Professional competences that were found to be significantly fostered all belong to higher order thinking skills, and include the ability to design and evaluate, analyze, interpret and create new engineering solutions. These findings provide empirical support for the use of applied student-centered strategies for developing competences relevant for future work, as well as reflections that can support engineering educators in designing similar teaching and learning environments.;"[Bozic, Marija] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, PhD Program Environm Educ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Bozic, Marija] Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile; [Certic, Jelena D.] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Telecommun, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia; [Vukelic, Milica; Cizmic, Svetlana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Dept Psychol, Cika Ljubina 18-20, Belgrade, Serbia";;"Bozic, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, PhD Program Environm Educ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.; Bozic, M (corresponding author), Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile.";"marija.bozic@e-campus.uab.cat; certic@etf.rs; mbvukeli@f.bg.ac.rs; scizmic@f.bg.ac.rs";"Vukelic, Milica/K-3179-2019; certic, jelena/A-3892-2013";"Vukelic, Milica/0000-0003-1744-9966; certic, jelena/0000-0002-8732-6251";"Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of The Republic of Serbia; Department of Telecommunications, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade";This research was carried out with the support of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of The Republic of Serbia.

When the bottom reservoir is heated, the system may experience periodic eruptions of hot water and steam at the top similarly to the geyser effect occurring in nature. The eruption frequency of a toy geyser is inspected experimentally as a function of the heating power and the height of the setup. We propose a thermodynamic model of this system that predicts the time between eruptions. A phase diagram that takes into account the thermal energy provided to the geyser and the geometry was constructed for the toy geyser. The conditions to obtain the geyser effect have been determined. The study of the toy geyser is then extended to the case of two reservoirs connected to the same tube. Such a coupled system adopts a complex time evolution that reflects the dynamics of natural geysers. We analyze the behavior of a toy geyser with two reservoirs by way of statistical tools and develop a theoretical model in order to rationalize our observations.;"[Brandenbourger, M.; Dorbolo, S.; Darbois Texier, B.] Univ Liege, Phys Dept, GRASP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Brandenbourger, M.] Univ Amsterdam, IOP, Soft Matter Grp, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Darbois Texier, B.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, SMAT C, Ave Ecuador 3493, Santiago 9170124, Chile";;Dorbolo, S (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Phys Dept, GRASP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.;s.dorbolo@uliege.be;"Brandenbourger, Martin/AAC-4715-2021; Darbois Texier, Baptiste/F-2747-2015";"Darbois Texier, Baptiste/0000-0002-8772-3433; Brandenbourger, Martin/0000-0002-5550-1895";"Inter-University Attraction Poles ProgrammeBelgian Federal Science Policy Office [IAP 7/38 MicroMAST]; FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS";This research has been funded by the Inter-University Attraction Poles Programme (IAP 7/38 MicroMAST) initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office.

Being physics a matter lying on the grounds of technical engineering it becomes naturally appropriate to introduce the use of calculus and programming as useful tools in the context of a physics problem. This can be accomplished by moving some Practical Classes of Physics (problem solving) into the computer pool and by reformulating the physics problems in order to make them more appropriate for this kind of approach. In this environment, students put together, for instance, programming tools and numerical methods, along with the physical laws in order to address more realistic models, different from those which can usually be treated on the blackboard. This kind of computational physics problems increases the motivation of the engineering students by embedding them into sceneries whose models are closer to those real problems they will be facing later in their professional and scientific life. This is particularly relevant for the first year of the engineering careers when the development of this kind of professional skills is usually skipped. In the present work we will illustrate these ideas by means of the known problem of The motion of a body subject to air drag force.

The study is undertaken in the background of the general stance of engineering instructors towards students' professional skills development required by the accreditation agencies. It covers also the assessment methods to determine whether LLL skills have been acquired and some strategies employed to promote it. The paper opines that as technology advances in modern knowledge-based economies, industry and other employers will more and more require engineers who are multi-skilled, adaptable and who can operate flexible systems. Therefore professional engineers who are committed to LLL will be in greater demand. Qualified engineers who are less skilled or have no capacity to upgrade their skills or adapt to rapid changes will less likely find attractive employment. The role of instructors in understanding and applying LLL competency cannot be overemphasised. However, in general instructors are not usually sure about their knowledge of LLL and are to some extent reluctant to include lifelong learning skills development in their teaching. The conclusions are that the attitude of students, knowledge of instructors and the learning environment are critical in promoting lifelong learning ability of engineering students.;"[Uziak, Jacek] Univ Botswana, Dept Mech Engn, Gaborone, Botswana; [Walczak, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Oladiran, M.

This collaboration began, by aiming to assess the development and impact evaluation of a participative and multi-disciplinary co-creation model, set up to design new products for self-reliant elderly in the Biobio region in Chile. Within a two-year period, several co-creation workshops with different interaction formats were conducted. The workshops were extremely valuable, not only in terms of design solutions, but also the participating students soon developed a high degree of empathy for the participating elderly, as representatives of a user group that was initially foreign to them. Empathy for their target users helped the students, not only with regard to determining requirements, but above all, with the design of an interaction that allowed suitably integrating elderly people into the design process. Examining these interactions revealed key elements of the learning process as well as the generic and specific success in teaching competences, an aspect that is directly sought by the industry. Based on these results, implications are derived for teaching user-empathy to engineering students as well as for curricula design.;"[Wallisch, Anne] Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Werner Heisenberg Weg 39, D-85577 Munich, Germany; [Carlos Briede-Westermeyer, Juan] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Engn Design, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso, Chile; [Luzardo-Briceno, Marianela] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Secc Bucaramanga, Kilometro 7 Via Piedecuesta, Floridablanca, Santander, Colombia";;Wallisch, A (corresponding author), Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Werner Heisenberg Weg 39, D-85577 Munich, Germany.;"anne.wallisch@unibw.de; juancarlos.briede@usm.cl; marianela.luzardo@upb.edu.co";Briede-Westermeyer, Juan Carlos/Q-8766-2018;"Briede-Westermeyer, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-5746-0169; Wallisch, Anne/0000-0001-8464-9373";CONICYT FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1171037];This research was supported by the CONICYT FONDECYT 1171037 project.;;64;1;1;0;4;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Some literature claims that students have difficulties understanding this representation and relating it to their understanding of the electric field concept. We conducted a study at the introductory level that aims to understand the effect of students' interpretation of electric field line diagrams on their application of the superposition principle for the electric field. The results give some evidence that an incorrect interpretation of the electric field line diagram may hinder the understanding of the superposition principle. Students who understand a vector representation of a field at a position tend to answer a superposition principle question better. We question whether teaching the electric field line representation is productive at the introductory level, and we discuss the need to have a representation that helps students reach a better understanding of the electric field concept and of the superposition principle.

To determine whether these changes would benefit future biologists, we investigated mathematics use in research biology. We surveyed prominent journals in high and low math-use areas for articles referencing the use of quantitative methods. In addition, we conducted a large-scale survey of research biologists within these fields about their use of, and training in, mathematics and statistics. We then performed follow-up interviews with a purposeful sample of respondents. Our results indicate that biologists need a base in descriptive and inferential statistics and mathematical modeling, including some concepts from calculus, focused on conceptual understanding rather than computational accuracy, followed by differentiated programs of study in mathematics and statistics, depending on intended discipline within biology. Comparison of our findings with the recommended requirements from major stakeholder groups indicates some alignment but also some discrepancies.

A novel experimental economics approach based on a computational Web platform of an electricity market is proposed here for the practical teaching of electrical engineering students. The approach is designed to diminish the gap that exists between theory and practice in this field, through a methodological strategy for teaching/learning called simulation. In the proposed simulation exercise, groups of students operate as market agents and have the freedom to create their own strategies. Additionally, a theoretical model and a specific simulation tool are used for the evaluation of the proposed strategies. The test system is based on the market structure of the Chilean wholesale electricity market and was tested on student groups at two universities. Based on the students' performance, the strategic behavior of agents and their impact on market price evolution are described and analyzed. Student assessment supports the conclusion that the proposed experimental economics framework offers a useful mechanism in student practical work for understanding and explaining the observed phenomena.;"[Guevara-Cedeno, Jessica Y.] Technol Univ Panama, Dept Elect Engn, Panama City 081907289, Panama; [Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo; Uribe, Rosa] Univ Chile, Fac Math & Phys Sci, Ctr Energy, Sch Engn,CMM,ISCI,DIE, Santiago 4123, Chile";;Guevara-Cedeno, JY (corresponding author), Technol Univ Panama, Dept Elect Engn, Panama City 081907289, Panama.;"jessica.guevara@utp.ac.pa; rodpalma@cec.uchile.cl";Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo E./A-1849-2012;"Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo E./0000-0002-7508-0944; Guevara Cedeno, Jessica Yarelys/0000-0002-7273-6848";"FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1080668]; IFARHU-SENACYT, Panama";"Manuscript received December 06, 2011; accepted February 23, 2012.

Background: University education is committed to change and adaptation to the current and new realities of the world. The framework for measuring the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) outcomes and Conceive- Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) syllabus have developed a list of competencies required by engineering students, encouraging universities to meet real-world needs. Intended Outcomes: Rethinking the role of engineering education and the purpose of education in the engineer's professional development, proposing a roadmap for engineering educators, helping them to define which teaching-learning techniques to apply to develop the competencies and skills that university and industry require from future engineers. Application Design: A relationship is shown between the competencies that today's engineers must have according to ABET criterion 3 (i.e., student outcomes), which are required for continuous accreditation of the engineering and CDIO syllabus, and the respective didactic techniques considered in this research. Findings: To develop competencies, students should be taught based on different teaching-learning techniques in higher education. A relationship is proposed for the engineering educator, showing them which didactic technique could be adequate to be applied in the classroom to develop in students the specific competencies established by ABET (SO1 to SO7) and CDIO (SL1 to SL4).;"[Forcael, Eric; Garces, Gonzalo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile; [Orozco, Francisco] Univ Panamer, Coll Engn, Zapopan 45010, Mexico";;Forcael, E (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile.;"eforcael@ubiobio.cl; gegarces@ubiobio.cl; forozco@up.edu.mx";;;;;;79;0;0;8;8;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

The main hypothesis was that the spelling tasks would predict the handwriting status of the children, although this influence would decrease with age due to a gradual automatization of handwriting skills. The results confirmed this hypothesis. Another interesting result was that the pattern of pseudoword and irregular word spellings as predictors of handwriting status changed from Grade 1 to Grade 3. In Grade 1, the pseudoword spelling task made a significant contribution, whereas the irregular word spelling task did not. The opposite pattern was found in Grade 3. These results may be a consequence of progressive acquisition of orthographic representations. The orthographic role of the task of writing the alphabet in order from memory in the prediction model was also analyzed. The writing of the alphabet in order from memory task made a significant contribution to the prediction of handwriting status of the children beyond the orthographic influence of spelling tasks. The additional effect of this task on the prediction of handwriting status is presumably due to the fact that this measure is based on fluency.;"[Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Villarroel, Rebeca] Univ Catolica Andres Bello, Caracas, Venezuela";;Rodriguez, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Educ, Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.;mrodriguez@ucsc.cl;"Villarroel, Rebeca/Z-1625-2019; Rodríguez, Cristina/H-1021-2015";"Villarroel, Rebeca/0000-0003-0401-2175; Rodríguez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767";Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion from the Government of the Canary Islands [ProID20100030];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion, ref.

For that reason, and with the aim of answering the growing demand for an adequate evaluation instrument for this group, the KidsLife scale was developed. Method: This research provides evidence of the reliability and validity of the scale, which is composed of 96 items spread over eight subscales, and completed by a third-party respondent. The validation sample comprised 1060 people with intellectual disability, with ages ranging from 4 to 21 years old (M = 13.51; SD = 5.04). Results: The results suggest that the eight quality of life domains assessed on the scale are reliable (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.812 to 0.949). The evidence of the validity of the construct provided by Confirmatory Factor Analysis also demonstrated adequate indexes of fit for the eight-domain model. Discussion: Future lines of research which may use the KidsLife Scale are suggested and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study enquires into Educational Science university students' attitudes towards people with disabilities analysing the differences that occur on the basis of the frequency of contact (almost permanent, habitual, frequent or sporadic), and the type of disability (motor, hearing, visual, intellectual or multiple) of the person with whom the contact is maintained. The participants were 900 students of the Faculty of Education of the University of Granada who completed the Scale of Attitudes towards people with disabilities. The analysis carried out shows significant differences depending on the contact with people with disabilities in different factors of the scale. In addition, there are more favourable attitudes in students who maintain sporadic contact, and also those in those with contact with people with sensory disabilities.;"[Polo Sanchez, M.

These sets of abilities are considered as separate but related domains with small to moderate correlations. The main objective of this study was to explore the relationship of intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior in adolescents with DS because previous studies have shown different relationship patterns between these constructs across other syndromes. Fifty-three adolescents with DS were assessed regarding their intellectual functioning whereas adaptive behavior was reported by parents and teachers. Participants showed a better performance on verbal than nonverbal tasks when assessing intellectual functioning, contrary to previous findings. Regarding adaptive behavior, higher social skills were reported than conceptual and practical skills. Intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior showed a medium correlation, consistent with observations in typical population. These results support the exploration of the variability across the DS phenotype.;"[Sabat, Camila; Tenorio, Marcela] Univ Andes, Sch Psychol, Monsenor Alvaro del Portilo 12455, Santiago, Chile; [Tasse, Marc] Ohio State Univ, Nisonger Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";;Tenorio, M (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Sch Psychol, Monsenor Alvaro del Portilo 12455, Santiago, Chile.;mtenorio@uandes.cl;;Tenorio, Marcela/0000-0003-0859-6462;Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150800];This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT), grant number: 11150800.;;47;5;5;2;12;AMER ASSOC INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES;WASHINGTON;444 N CAPITOL ST, NW STE 846, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-1512 USA;1934-9491;1934-9556;;INTELLECT DEV DISAB;Intellect.

Two independent survey studies tested this connection. In the first study (100 centers, 714 workers, and 612 family members), results confirmed that burnout has a negative relationship with workers' perceptions of service quality. In turn, these perceptions are associated with the service quality perceptions of family members and their satisfaction with the service. In a replication sample (86 centers, 601 workers, and 819 family members), we reproduced these results and added situational constraints in the model.

The study included three experiments: (a) the identification of Chilean signs and fingerspelled words, (b) the matching of fingerspelled words with commercial logos, and (c) the decoding of fingerspelled words and the mapping of these words onto the writing system.

However, there is little agreement among academics as to both the extent of knowledge required in particular skills and what is the right mix of the technical and professional skills. These two issues are reviewed in this paper in terms of graduate attributes from the perspective of employers of mechanical engineering graduates. A survey of Chilean industry revealed a significant discrepancy between the desired and actual graduate profiles with almost all attributes rated as relevant but not used frequently or vice versa. Interestingly, the least discrepancy and the least relevance were found for technical skills with particular reference to the design and conduction of experiments. The apparent importance of professional skills over technical skills is discussed in the context of employers' expectations that are not necessarily aligned with current educational programs. It was concluded that instruction in professional skills should be embedded into the technical courses to promote active, reflective and student-centered learning.;"[Walczak, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Uziak, Jacek; Oladiran, M.

Commercial broadcast satellites provide convenient point sources for comparison to the Sun's extended disk. The mathematical background of an adding interferometer is presented, as is its design and development, including the receiver system, and sample measurements of the Sun. Results from a student laboratory report are shown. With the increasing importance of interferometry in astronomy, the lack of educational interferometers is an obstacle to training the future generation of astronomers. This interferometer provides the hands-on experience needed to fully understand the basic concepts of interferometry. (C) 2016 Author(s).

However, given the accelerating demographic, environmental, economical, socio-political, and technological changes-and their associated risks and opportunities-there is increasing consensus that our current educational systems are falling short and that we need to repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Futures of Education initiative was formally launched at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 to provide such a vision of education for the future. The International Scientific and Evidence-based Education (ISEE) Assessment synthesizes knowledge streams generated by different communities and stakeholders at all levels and scales and will thereby essentially contribute to re-envisioning this future of education. The overall aim of the ISEE Assessment is to pool the expertise from a broad range of knowledge holders and stakeholders to undertake a scientifically robust and evidence-based assessment in an open and inclusive manner of our current educational systems and its necessary reforms. In this commentary, we discuss the aims and goals of the ISEE Assessment. We describe how the ISEE Assessment will address key questions on the purpose of education and what, how, where and when we learn, and evaluate the alignment of today's education and theory of learning with the current and forthcoming needs and challenges and to inform policymaking for future education.;"[Duraiappah, Anantha; Mochizuki, Yoko; Ramaswamy, Rajiv; Chatterjee Singh, Nandini] UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Inst Educ Peace & Sustaina, New Delhi, India; [van Atteveldt, Nienke; Buil, J.

We explored whether number of mental health problems differed by disability, age, gender, living situation, physical health, and access to services. Methods and procedures: An online survey about experiences during the pandemic was administered to adults with IDD and their caregivers in the United States and in Chile. Outcomes and results: In both Chile and the United States, few people endorsed increased health problems. Half of the sample in Chile and 41 % of the sample in the United States endorsed increased mental health problems.

On a monthly basis or more often, a majority of teachers reported they provided weaker writers with choice about writing assignments, the opportunity to complete an alternative writing assignment, and extra writing instruction via computer technology. How often an adaptation was applied did not differ by grade. The perceived adequacy of teacher undergraduate preparation to teach writing, their efficacy to teach writing, and the proportion of students with disability in their classes each made a unique and statistically significant contribution to predicting how frequently teachers applied adaptations for their weakest writers.

In addition to the incorporation of academically directed activities and new tools for transmitting information, the change of approach also means new training explicitly oriented to develop the new professional competences. This paper presents the results from a funded teaching project aimed at exploring the use of the scientific poster as a tool to improve transversal competences in Civil Engineering students. To cope with this objective, a total of 68 civil engineering students from two different universities in Spain and Ireland were chosen. The poster design allows students to do in-depth research on a specific topic and to engage its research inquiry. The student's perception of this project was evaluated by means of two questionnaires surveyed prior and after the poster presentation. The research findings suggest that the scientific posters elaboration enables the development of different transversal competences of the students such as comprehension and integration, teamwork and leadership reinforcement, and effective communication. About 94% of respondents felt that this activity was valuable in improving their communication skills.;"[Senent-Aparicio, Javier; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia; Perez-Sanchez, Julio; Leon, Loreto; Pulido-Velazquez, David] Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Arias, Mauricio] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tampa, FL USA; [O'Driscoll, Leonard] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Rossa Ave, Cork, Ireland; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Geol Survey Spain, Rios Rosas,23, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Santiago 7500138, Chile; [Pulido-Velazquez, David] Geol Survey Spain, 4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain";;Senent-Aparicio, J (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain.;"jsenent@ucam.edu; pjimeno@ucam.edu; mearias@usf.edu; Leonard.ODriscoll@cit.ie; jperez058@ucam.edu; Lleon@ucam.edu; fj.alcala@igme.es; d.pulido@igme.es";"Pulido-Velazquez, David/D-7412-2013; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/C-4533-2013; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia/ABG-1980-2020; Perez-Sanchez, Julio/L-2335-2017";"Pulido-Velazquez, David/0000-0001-7985-0769; Alcalá, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-8165-8669; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia/0000-0003-4733-7236; Perez-Sanchez, Julio/0000-0002-2615-6076";UCAM [PMAFI-PID-18/16];The researchers are grateful to the participating students for giving of their time to this study and would like to express our gratitude for the collaboration of the UCAM and CIT.

The TCM proposes MLD as a heterogeneous disorder, with two distinguishable profiles: a representational subtype and a verbal subtype. A sample of elementary school 3rd to 6th graders was divided into two age cohorts (3rd - 4th grades, and 5th - 6th grades). Using data-driven strategies, based on the cognitive classification variables predicted by the TCM, our sample of children with MLD clustered as expected: a group with representational deficits and a group with number-fact retrieval deficits.

The effect of the use of computer simulations in the course shows that the students who were taught with simulation gained a better understanding of linear scheduling concepts and techniques than those students taught without simulation. The data and analysis leading to this finding are presented and discussed in this paper. Two groups of students were considered in this research: (1) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida and (2) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Chile. Each group was randomly separated into two subgroups: one subgroup was taught by using the traditional method of linear scheduling (without the use of computer simulation) and the other subgroup was taught by using simulations. At the end of the teaching period, the students in both subgroups answered an objective test-type questionnaire specifically designed to address their understanding of linear scheduling techniques. They were also required, in a more subjective way, to provide their evaluation of the teaching method involved. To assess the effect of incorporating computer simulation in teaching linear scheduling, the students' evaluations and answers to the questionnaire were statistically compared. The analysis of the responses showed significant differences between the students' understanding of the subject by using the two teaching methods, with the use of computer simulation shown to be a more effective teaching tool for linear scheduling techniques.

The objectives of the study were to identify sustainable engineering practices used by the Inca, determine which practices can apply to modern design and construction, and share findings with visitors at the National Museum of the American Indian and others throughout the world through live interactive satellite broadcasts. This paper focuses on the technologies that were used to accomplish the broadcasts and used to support the engineering and construction analysis of the Inca Road. Each technology used on these expeditions provided a unique opportunity to learn about the road and disseminate findings with others. The technologies utilized included communication equipment (e.g.,satellite router and dish, Wi-Fi, and mobile portable video equipment), location and mapping technologies [e.g.,geographic information system (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS)], photogrammetric techniques for three-dimensional modeling, laser range finding for precision measurement of the road features, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for use in nondestructive testing and evaluation of subsurface conditions. The technologies are explained in this paper along with the challenges of implementing them in such harsh and extreme conditions. In addition, some of the more salient engineering and construction discoveries are included. This information can be useful for others who are interested in implementing a similar approach for studying ancient civil infrastructure in other remote locations.

In the experimental design, the students were randomly divided into two groups. Traditional teaching sessions were imparted to the first group, which was designated as the control group, whereas the CPM was taught to the second group via the PBL teaching methodology. After the classroom sessions, an evaluation tool was applied: responses were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Fisher statistics, and a set of open-ended questions were qualitatively analyzed via a pattern-matching technique. The results for the group that utilized PBL were favorable; this finding demonstrated the efficiency of this tool for teaching CPM. In addition, the results for the students that applied PBL methodology demonstrated a high degree of acceptance of the CPM methodology, which motivates its implementation into teaching other subjects related to project scheduling in civil engineering.

This definition invites transcending environmental education and education for sustainability's frontiers, examining the ontology, or the 'place', from where actors co-construct these conflicts. If actors don't question the reified and divided assumptions of the 'self' and 'reality' at the base of these conflicts, the creative and transformative potential of becoming together cannot unfold. The transformational learning approach is a coherent way of addressing this challenge, as it promotes an ontological change in actors and their worldview. The training experience offered by the University of Santiago provides insights into how transformational education's perspective can contribute to education in political ecology, inciting an acknowledgment of the self and the world as a complex and dynamic entanglement of actors.;"[Paz Aedo, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, GAMA, Santiago, Chile; [Schaeffer, Colombina] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile";;"Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile.; Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile.";santiago.peredo@usach.cl;;;Universidad de Santiago de Chile [USA 155];This work was supported by Universidad de Santiago de Chile (Project USA 155).;;40;4;4;0;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-4622;1469-5871;;ENVIRON EDUC RES;Environ.

In particular we draw attention to the unwillingness of the majority of these employees to name or recognize specific forms of institutional inequality. Following critical pedagogy literature we argue that the Chilean education system reproduces a fear of talk among teachers working in areas with high density indigenous populations, which obscures unequal social structures and opportunities for specific (class, gender, ethnic) groups in school contexts. Based on data from 12 interviews with school staff and observations from four schools in southern Chile, we analyze how intersecting inequality is discursively reduced by predominantly white teachers to individual deficit, de-politicized geographical problems of access to schooling, and the normalizing of low achievement across schools with students from similar backgrounds.;"[Webb, Andrew; Canales, Andrea] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Becerra, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Villarrica Campus, Chile";;Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile.;Andrew.webb@uc.cl;;"Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670; Canales, Andrea/0000-0002-0391-1681";"Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR), [FONDAP] [15110006]; Concurso Politicas Pubilcas [6030]";This research was partially funded by the Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR), [FONDAP Numero: 15110006] and Concurso Politicas Pubilcas 2016 No. 6030.;;44;5;6;1;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1361-3324;1470-109X;;RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK;Race Ethn.

The study estimates both the utility obtained by parents from different school attributes and the effective utility obtained with the actual school choice made by parents. The difference between both types of utilities provides a panorama on how market imperfections affect the general equilibrium of the education market. The results show that parents have different preference functions depending on their socioeconomic level. Nevertheless, regardless of the socioeconomic level, in all preference functions teacher performance remains highly significant. The findings suggest that even if parents would want the schools that serve their children to fulfill a series of academic criteria, they cannot use academic attributes when choosing a school for their children.

Although health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children has been described as an individual's subjective perception of the impact of health status on physical, psychological and social functioning, in very young children, a HRQoL parent-proxy report is needed since (pre)schoolchildren have problems expressing their feelings and understanding items on HRQoL instruments. In addition, the influence of motor competence on fitness levels has strong empirical support, so it seems reasonable to hypothesize that cardiorespiratory fitness might play a crucial role in the association between motor competence and HRQoL in children. Objectives:This study examined the association between gross motor competence (G-MC) and HRQoL in typically developing children, and whether this association between G-MC and HRQoL was mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods:An observational cross-sectional study with 1088 (pre)schoolchildren (51.84% boys, 48.16% girls) aged between 4 and 7 years (5.32 +/- 0.60) belonging to 21 schools in the Spanish provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real were included. G-MC was evaluated using the MABC-2 battery, HRQoL was assessed using the KINDL-R questionnaire and cardiorespiratory fitness using the 20m-shuttle-run-test. Partial correlations, covariance models and mediation analyses were conducted. Results:The mean scores of HRQoL (physical well-being, self-esteem, friends, school and global score index) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in children with higher G-MC. When cardiorespiratory fitness was added as a covariate, all the results remained unchanged (p < 0.05), except for physical well-being for the total sample as well as emotional well-being and the global score index for girls. Simple mediation analyses showed that cardiorespiratory fitness acted as a mediator between G-MC and physical well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.07]) for the total sample. For boys, it acted as a mediator between G-MC and physical well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.00; 0.08]) and school (Indirect Effect = 0.05 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.09]), and, for girls, between G-MC and emotional well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.08]) and the global score index (Indirect Effect = 0.02 [95% CI = 0.00; 0.05]). Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that good G-MC levels are associated with better HRQoL, mainly in global score index of HRQoL and self-esteem, friends, and school dimensions in typically developing children. Further, cardiorespiratory fitness mediates the association between G-MC and the physical dimension of HRQoL in (pre)schoolchildren. Additionally, physical and academic dimensions are mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness for boys and the emotional and global score indices of HRQoL are mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness for girls. These findings provide scientific evidence that improving motor competence and cardiorespiratory fitness might be a practical strategy to increase HRQoL in children. Thus, families and the educational community should promote effective interventions and incorporate opportunities inside and outside school that aim to jointly improve motor competence and cardiorespiratory fitness.";"[Redondo-Tebar, Andres; Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel; Notario-Pacheco, Blanca; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Social & Hlth Res Ctr, Cuenca, Spain; [Fatouros, Ioannis G.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Karies, Trikala, Greece; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Talca, Chile; [Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Ciudad Real, Spain";;Martinez-Vizcaino, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ctr Estudios Sociosanitarios, C Santa Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain.;vicente.martinez@uclm.es;"VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/AAZ-9034-2021; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/R-4336-2017; SANCHEZ-LOPEZ, MAIRENA/J-7933-2016; Redondo-Tébar, Andrés/X-7827-2019";"VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; Redondo-Tébar, Andrés/0000-0001-5920-6159; Sanchez Lopez, Mairena/0000-0002-0217-0623; Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel/0000-0002-5127-0591; FATOUROS, IOANNIS/0000-0002-8475-8411";University of Castilla-La Mancha [2018-CPUCLM-7813, 3A2400/NL38532];We would like to thank the schools, families and pupils participating in the study.

We found that the three scales in either survey (except Sense of Belonging to School in PISA) reached at least metric invariance. The scale scores from the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and the item response theory analysis were highly correlated, pointing to robustness of scaling methods. The correlations between each construct and achievement was generally positive within each culture in each survey, and the correlational pattern was similar across surveys (except for Sense of Belonging), indicating certain convergence in the cross-survey validation.

Hence, learning a manipulative task is generally more effective when watching animations that show natural motions of the task, rather than equivalent static pictures. The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found. Follow-up analyses indicated that females benefited more than males from using animated presentations.;"[Wong, Mona; Castro-Alonso, Juan C.; Ayres, Paul; Paas, Fred] Univ New S Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Inst Psychol, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands";;Wong, M (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;"p.wong@unsw.edu.au; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; p.ayres@unsw.edu.au; paas@fsw.eur.nl";"Paas, Fred/G-4246-2016; Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019; Wong, Mona/R-9026-2019; , CIAE/R-5423-2017";"Paas, Fred/0000-0002-1647-5305; Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Wong, Mona/0000-0002-5595-6371; ";"CONICYT (PAI) [82140021]; CONICYT (national funding research program for returning researchers from abroad) [82140021]; CONICYT (Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence) [FB0003]";"This research was partially supported by funds from CONICYT (PAI, national funding research program for returning researchers from abroad, 2014, No 82140021; and Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB0003) to the second author.";;59;30;31;0;23;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

An analytical framework is proposed and applied to a case study of an international wiki-based project. Key findings are that there is a tension between participants' sense of inside and outside influences, resulting in a complex and challenging working environment.

Based on an unprecedented intervention in the area of music, this paper evaluates the impact of intensive participation of children and young at-risk students in the creation and development of the first youth orchestra of the municipality of Curanilahue, a small and poor county in the south of Chile, South America. After confronting many potential sources of selection bias in the impact estimation-self-selection, parents selection, orchestra selection, payment capacity-we found positive effects of this experience on participants at both the cognitive and socio-emotional levels. We found that orchestra participation positively affects both language and mathematics in SAT-like tests. The estimated impacts are in the upper bound of the impact evaluation sizes range in the developing world (e.g. Duflo et al., 2013; McEwan, 2012; Ganimian and Murnane, 2016). Furthermore, having analyzed the increase in test scores for those students participating in the orchestra who take the test more than once, we find results that indicate a progressive increase in their scores, both in mathematics and in language, an indicator that can be considered as a proxy of socio-emotional outcomes related to the orientation and persistence to obtain personal goals.";"[Egana-delSol, Pablo] Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;"Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.";"pegana@mit.edu; dcontrer@econ.uchile.cl; jp.valenzuelab@gmail.com";;;"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Millennium Nucleus of Social Development - Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile); PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";We would like to thank Jere Behrman, Cristian Bellei, Ernesto Trevino, Amanda Telias, Miguel Urquiola and Stephen Wu for their comments and suggestions on previous versions.

The aims of the research were to identify and characterize the representations and knowledge that teachers in service have, from an average level of education, with respect to the competences of scientific thought and problem solution, and the way in which both should be approached. With the use of an intentional sample of 133, teachers selected from a total of 117 who were incorporated to other phases of the research trough the administration of a questionnaire especially designed, was show the predominance of a very fragmented image, sometimes contradictory, about the solution of problems and about relation between competences of scientific thought; this representation incorporates aspects of great value for the formation of the competent students, and at the same time it includes other aspects that in no way favor this formation, according to the present assessments. It is remarkable that both competences for scientific thought and solution of problems are not constituted as a totality and coherent system in the thinking of the teachers who participated in the research. It should be pointed out that we found data that show an oscillating valuation of the subjective character of the problematic situations and the problem itself; these data show, as well, that teachers give a very important role to language. It is stated that teachers give an oscillating value to the fact that students must deal with theories. It should be noted too that their approaches to the algorithmic processes are very vague, and sometimes contradictory.";"[Quintanilla, M.; Joglar, C.; Jara, R.; Camacho, J.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ravanal, E.] Univ Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Labarrere, A.] Univ Santo Tomas, Santiago, Chile; [Izquierdo, M.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Cuellar, L.] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Chamizo, J.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico";;Quintanilla, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.;"mquintag@puc.cl; rjaracl@uc.cl; jpcamach@uc.cl; jpcamach@uc.cl; eravanalmoreno@gmail.com; lhcuella@uc.cl; merce.izquierdo@uab.cat; jchamizo@servidor.unam.mx";;cuellar fernandez, luigi hawer/0000-0002-0659-9101;;;;19;5;7;1;11;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;BELLATERRA (BARCELONA);SERVEI DE PUBLICACIONS, BELLATERRA (BARCELONA), 00000, SPAIN;0212-4521;;;ENSEN CIENC;Ensen.

This study examines the contribution of three factors to the development of pre-service science teachers' SRC: the amount of science education classes, the amount of science classes and the pre-service science teachers' age. The factors amount of science education classes and amount of science classes have been operationalised in terms of ECTS credit points. N = 438 pre-service science teachers from six universities in Germany, Chile and Canada voluntarily and anonymously responded to an established multiple-choice instrument for assessing SRC, which has been developed by the authors and is available in German, Spanish and English. Multiple linear regression analyses show that the included factors explain a proportion of about 9% of the pre-service science teachers' SRC. The factor amount of science classes is the only significant predictor and can be seen as an indicator of learning science content knowledge. These findings support the assumption of science content knowledge being a prerequisite for developing pre-service science teachers' SRC.;"[Krell, Moritz] IPN Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Khan, Samia] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Vergara, Claudia] Alberto Hurtado Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile; [Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Mathesius, Sabrina; Krueger, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany";;Krell, M (corresponding author), IPN Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Kiel, Germany.;"krell@leibniz-ipn.de; samia.khan@ubc.ca; claudia.vergara12@gmail.com; hernan.cofre@pucv.cl; sabrina.mathesius@fu-berlin.de; dirk.krueger@fu-berlin.de";;Krell, Moritz/0000-0003-2226-0383;"German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01PK11004A, 01PK15004A]; International Cooperation programme for attraction of advanced human capital [MEC 80180066]; 2018 UBC-FUB Joint Funding Scheme; Projekt DEAL";Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

We argue that some Catholic schools in Chile reproduce the category 'woman' as a pure, selfless, sexy, heterosexual mother who is an inferior and erasable being that is frequently discounted. This reproduction is done via different procedures of shaming, silencing, and even sexual violence. We experienced the telling of these testimonios as troubling but productive. First, this paper addresses the ideologies, values, and practices that Catholic schools construct around gender. Second, it suggests that the telling of and engagement with stories of embodied experiences is a beneficial strategy to battle gender oppression and work through productive discomfort and affects.

However, some authors have questioned the validity of the instruments available so far, since their psychometric quality has not been evaluated satisfactorily. In this study, an established German multiple-choice instrument to assess scientific reasoning competencies has been translated into English and Spanish and the translated versions were evaluated based on the translation, review, adjudication, pretesting and documentation (TRAPD) approach. Based on samples of German (N = 497), Australian (N = 103), and Chilean (N = 135) pre-service science teachers, statistical analyses (e.g. dimensionality and DIF analyses) provide psychometric evidence for test equivalence between the German and the translated versions of the instrument. Known groups comparisons provide evidence for the valid interpretation of the test scores as measures of scientific reasoning competencies. It is discussed that further studies might evaluate additional sources of validity evidence for the translated versions of the instrument, particularly focusing on cultural specificities. Independent of this need for further research, it is suggested that the three versions can be used to assess the scientific reasoning competencies of pre-service science teachers whose first language is English, German, or Spanish.;"[Krell, Moritz; Mathesius, Sabrina; Kruger, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Schwendenerstr 1, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [van Driel, Jan] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Vergara, Claudia] Alberto Hurtado Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile";;Krell, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Schwendenerstr 1, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.;moritz.krell@fu-berlin.de;;"Van Driel, Jan/0000-0002-8185-124X; Krell, Moritz/0000-0003-2226-0383; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457";"German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01PK11004A/01PK15004A]; Center for International Cooperation of Freie Universitat Berlin";This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (projects Ko-WADiS/ValiDiS, grant numbers 01PK11004A/01PK15004A) and the Center for International Cooperation of Freie Universitat Berlin (research in Melbourne);;69;7;7;2;14;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

Investigations have shown that aligning the design of learning experiences with students' needs creates synergy in the teaching and learning classroom processes. This can be achieved through orchestration, the guided integration of conventional and digital resources. This study seeks to investigate how orchestration increases student learning while taking into consideration their different pace of learning and monitoring the standards that the curriculum requires of a teacher. This is done by adopting a model which incorporates both the requirements of a school system's curriculum, as well as the students' specific needs based on their effective learning. It also seeks to determine which elements enrich the learning experience within an orchestrated framework. This study experimentally shows a significant increase in student learning when orchestrations are made available to teachers, when teachers successfully integrate technology into the classroom and when systematic use of the available resources is made. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of addressing weaknesses in each student's base of knowledge by adapting the activities in the classroom to their individual pace of learning.;"[Diaz, Anita; Nussbaum, Miguel] Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Nopo, Hugo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Maldonado-Carreno, Carolina] Univ Los Andes, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia; [Corredor, Javier] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia";;Diaz, A (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile.;"akdiaz@puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; hugon@iadb.org; ca-maldo@uniandes.edu.co; creivaj@gmail.com";Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Nopo, Hugo/0000-0003-1769-2376";"Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice from Chile [CIE01-CONICYT]";The research was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Grant CIE01-CONICYT, from Chile.;;31;4;4;1;18;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Although there are a large number of studies on the subject of culture, these are qualitative in nature and not focused on school contexts. Our aim is to develop a quantitative instrument for primary education that determines the cultural texture within an individual institution, as well as among different kinds of schools. For this purpose, Hofstede's original instrument was adapted, taking into consideration the characteristics and practices of primary school students. A factor analysis and complementary qualitative analysis of the factors obtained from 783 surveys (administered to third and fourth graders) led to the creation of five dimensions, which contrasted with Hofstede's theoretical dimensions. These dimensions include Value of School Achievement, Value of Institutional Structure, Resistance to change, Normative versus Affective and Value of Equality in the Production of Knowledge. Furthermore, this new set of dimensions was a more accurate representation of the school context and the values held by primary school students. Significant differences were found in three of the dimensions when analyzing the cultural differences of the sample and taking into account the students' socioeconomic background. These findings are important as they reveal the presence of subcultures within a given society, which are determined by belonging to a certain socioeconomic class. Measuring cultural values among primary school students contributes to the creation of educational models, the design of educational institutions and the development of public policy since new structures cannot succeed without adequate cultural support.;"[Gelerstein, Damian; Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Cortes, Ana] Syracuse Univ, Program Composit & Cultural Rhetor, 900 South Crouse Ave,239 HB Crouse Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Castillo, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Gelerstein, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;dgelerst@ing.puc.cl;Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983;"CONICYT-FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150045]; VRI-UC Interdisciplinary Research Project [13/ 2014]";This research was funded by CONICYT-FONDECYT grant 1150045, and by the VRI-UC Interdisciplinary Research Project No 13/ 2014.;;49;0;0;1;9;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2210-6561;;;LEARN CULT SOC INTER;Learn.

However, producing MOOCs has shown to be a cumbersome and expensive activity for HE institutions. For this reason, many universities have started to explore and experiment with hybrid initiatives in which locally produced and third-party MOOCs are reused and integrated into traditional courses. Most of the hybrid initiatives described in the literature so far focus on flipped classroom experiences, although there are some other possibilities for integrating MOOCs in the curriculum. Moreover, few studies have reported on the institutional support required for implementing hybrid initiatives, and their benefits from a curriculum perspective. In order to shed some light on the opportunities that arise from the reuse of MOOCs, this paper presents H-MOOC, a framework that describes hybrid MOOC-based initiatives as a continuum of two factors: (1) institutional support to reuse an existing MOOC, and (2) curricular content alignment between the MOOC and the program, or the course hybridized. In addition, H-MOOC proposes indicators to measure the impact of these initiatives at both educational and institutional levels. Examples of actual hybrid initiatives and a set of guiding questions are presented to show how to apply the H-MOOC framework in different contexts.;"[Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Assessment & Evaluat, Santiago, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Madrid, Spain; [Kloos, Carlos Delgado] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Kloos, Carlos Delgado] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Scalable Digital Educ All, Madrid, Spain; [Rayyan, Saif] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";;Perez-Sanagustin, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.;"mar.perez@ing.puc.cl; ihilliger@ing.puc.cl; calario@it.uc3m.es; cdk@it.uc3m.es; srayyan@mit.edu";"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Rayyan, Saif/H-9199-2013; Pérez-Sanangustín, Mar/G-8981-2015; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Rayyan, Saif/0000-0002-5961-4969; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963";"Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Project The Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy [14ENI2-26862]; Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; project MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; project SHEILA [562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD]; project COMPETEN-SEA [574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network [S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R, FPDI-2013-17411]";This work has been partially supported by the Fondecyt Project (11150231), the Project The Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy (14ENI2-26862), the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union, projects MOOC-Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), SHEILA (562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD) and COMPETEN-SEA (574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), by the Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network (S2013/ICE-2715), and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, project RESET (TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R) and fellowship FPDI-2013-17411.;;24;32;32;4;52;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1726;1867-1233;;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

Proponents argue that choice would open up opportunities to disadvantaged families. Critics counter that choice may exacerbate inequities as advantaged parents are more likely to choose the best schools. Rio de Janeiro and Santiago provide unique institutional contexts in which to explore how choice may affect equity. We use datasets with information on home addresses to compare the choices of parents with different backgrounds. We find that disadvantaged parents in both cities are less likely to choose high achieving schools. The differences are more pronounced in Santiago than in Rio. These results suggest that choice policies will likely not reduce inequities and the design of the program influences behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study shows how technology used in a flipped classroom can improve learning among pre-service teachers, as well as boosting perceptions of their own technology skills. The students covered the instructional content before class through videos complemented by formative assessment. The data resulted in a report that the teacher then used to adapt their lecture, as well as defining the questions to be asked using an in-class response system. The responses to these questions were then discussed with the students. The results show that it is possible to change pre-service teachers' perceptions of using technology in the classroom, both as a student and as a future teacher.;"[Barahona, Camila; Nussbaum, Miguel; Espinosa, Pablo; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Telemat Engn Dept, Leganes, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, IRIT, Toulouse, France";;Barahona, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;cebaraho@uc.cl;;;"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21161695]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180024]";"This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21161695]; FONDECYT [1180024].";;35;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1475-939X;1747-5139;;TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC;Technol.

It is critical to enhance the preparedness of children against earthquakes through effective education and training. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and serious games (SGs) are innovative digital technologies that enable realistic and engaging training environments. However, little research has been made on the applications of IVR SGs for earthquake training targeting children. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents an IVR SG training system based on a problem-based gaming framework. Three instructional mechanisms within the training system, namely prior instruction, immediate feedback, and post-game assessment, were investigated to promote learning through effective reflection. A controlled experiment involving 125 secondary school students aged from 11 to 15 years old was undertaken, using leaflets as a traditional training approach for the control group and the IVR SG training system as the main intervention. Results revealed that the IVR SG training system with post-game assessment was the most effective way to train children, with greater knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy improvement observed. Possible improvements, such as increasing the time for reflection and differentiating the stimulation between positive and negative feedback, are suggested for further research.;"[Feng, Zhenan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Feng, Zhenan] Massey Univ, Sch Built Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mutch, Carol] Univ Auckland, Dept Crit Studies Educ, Auckland, New Zealand; [Amor, Robert] Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso, Chile";;Feng, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.;zfen124@aucklanduni.ac.nz;"Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo/AAA-4172-2022; Feng, Zhenan/N-1336-2018";Feng, Zhenan/0000-0001-7513-8942;;;;100;5;5;7;32;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

The purpose of this study was to gauge students' visual attention in their Mathematics and English classrooms. This article reports on a study conducted in three schools in Santiago, Chile, where a sample of 113 randomly selected students wore a mini-video camera mounted on eyeglass in their Mathematics and English lessons. Using Google images, we automatically and objectively examined 723,600 frames from the recordings where the classroom teacher appeared in the students' visual field. The results show that students' visual attention varies depending on four factors: (a) gender of the student, (b) age of the students, whether students are low/high attainers and (d) whether students are in English or Mathematics lessons. Surprisingly, students significantly paid more visual attention in their Mathematics than in English lessons. High attainers were more visually engaged than their low attainers counterparts. Students appeared to be visually engaged differently at different stages in their education. Furthermore, girls were more visually engaged than boys. The results of this study can have enormous practical implications for teachers and teacher education, in order to be better visually engaged with students during teaching.;"[Farsani, Danyal] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Radmehr, Farzad; Zakariya, Yusuf Feyisara] Univ Agder, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Math Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Radmehr, Farzad] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Teacher Educ Culture & Sport, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway; [Alizadeh, Mohadaseh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Math Sci, Dept Appl Math, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran";;Farsani, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;danyal.farsani@gmail.com;"Zakariya, Yusuf F/G-2868-2017; Radmehr, Farzad/S-3150-2018";"Zakariya, Yusuf F/0000-0002-5266-8227; Radmehr, Farzad/0000-0002-0592-9148; Farsani, Danyal/0000-0002-9412-3161; Alizadeh, Mohadeseh/0000-0002-9883-1835";"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170062]";"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: FB0003; FONDECYT, Grant/Award Number: 3170062";;49;1;2;2;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

This paper explores the discursive production of students with special educational needs in the context of professional development (PD) for collaborative problem-solving teaching. We held interviews with Chilean primary school teachers after their participation in PD and used a post-structural analysis to examine them. We turned to policy and institutional practices to understand the disability discourses that were evident. Teachers called on medical and deficit discourses to produce these students as abnormal and problematic in their learning of mathematics. Yet teachers also blurred the lines of categorisation between and within labels of special needs, including other students in these terms. Simultaneously, the reform PD created space for a counter discourse of ability. We suggest PD should help teachers of mathematics resist deficit discourses and see the ways in which experience may run contrary to them.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand; [Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile";;Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand.;l.darragh@auckland.ac.nz;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;"Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710; Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094";"CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160469, 3180238]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";The research reported in this paper was made possible by funding from the following funding sources: CONICYT/FONDECYT No. 3160469 and No. 3180238, and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.;;48;6;6;2;4;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

In such systems, the actors are encouraged to strive for continuous development in learning organisations based on teamwork, distributed leadership, and professional learning communities. School leaders are positioned between district level administrators and teachers in such processes and have the responsibility to secure professional development. Using the implementation of the national program 'Assessment for Learning' in Norway as a case, the article shows that leaders approach professional development differently. Analyses of interviews with leaders from 7 schools reveal three distinct approaches related to how school leaders perceive knowledge. Some school leaders assume that teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills and trust them to manage the implementation process without leader support. Other school leaders distrust teachers' knowledge and skills and assume that the proper knowledge exists outside the school. These leaders seek external support when they meet teacher resistance. In a third approach, school leaders assume that knowledge develops through collaboration and thereby engage with teachers in continuous judgment about the implementation procedure. In the discussion, questions of trust and distrust are analysed in relation to how professional knowledge is developed and how professional discretion can support the development of intelligent accountability in schools.;"[Tolo, Astrid] Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England; [Florez Petour, Maria Teresa] Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Hopfenbeck, Therese N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr Educ Assessment, Dept Educ, Oxford, England";;Tolo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway.;"astrid.tolo@uib.no; solvi.lillejord@uib.no; mtflorez@u.uchile.cl; therese.hopfenbeck@education.ox.ac.uk";;;;;;94;3;3;1;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1389-2843;1573-1812;;J EDUC CHANG;J.

In this article, we seek to understand Chilean teachers' collective identity performances after PD into collaborative problem-solving mathematics. We undertook a classical thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews held with 10 primary school teachers 18months after their participation in PD. We present an innovative report of our findings by combining the interview analysis into a movie synopsis and creating a fictional protagonist, Tia (aunty' in Spanish), who represents the common findings from the ten teachers. We found the attractive identities performed by teachers, in particular the mother-saviour' and the successful' teacher, conflicted with their understandings of the teacher role promoted by PD. We argue the unique method of combining data allowed for reporting findings with both breadth and depth and this enabled us to see the way in which identities are culturally and contextually produced. We suggest PD needs to cater to these attractive teacher identities in order to be successful and sustainable in the long term.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Radovic, Darinka] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.;l.darragh@auckland.ac.nz;;Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710;"CONICYT Proyectos Fondecyt Post-doctorado [3160469, 3180291]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003, AFB170001]; Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS [2807]";"We wish to acknowledge the following funding sources: CONICYT Proyectos Fondecyt Post-doctorado #3160469 and #3180291; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 (CIAE) and AFB170001 (CMM) and Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.";;40;2;2;1;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

The objective of the present study was to describe self-perceived EBM competencies in physicians and medical students enrolled in a massive virtual EBM course. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study. People interested in a free virtual EBM course fulfilled their data in a virtual form for their registration in September 2020. In this form, 22 competencies related to four dimensions of EBM were evaluated: asking a clinical question, search, analysis, and application; using a 5-option Likert scale. The resulting database was analyzed, selecting people who claimed to be physicians or medical students of 18 years or more. Results 1793 participants were included: 1130 medical students and 663 physicians; more than 80% lived in Peru. The frequency of participants who agreed or strongly agreed with feeling qualified in each competence ranged: from 39.2% to 57.8% for the competencies of the 'Asking a clinical question' dimension, from 39.2% to 56.1% for 'Search,' from 19.9% to 32.0% for 'Analysis,' and from 19.6% to 29.9% for 'Application.' Both in physicians and students, the lowest frequencies were for the competencies of interpretation of impact measures, graphs, and results of systematic reviews; as well as shared decision making and calculation of expected benefit. Physicians who graduated more recently scored better on competencies from search and analysis dimensions. Conclusion Among physicians and medical students enrolled in the course, self-perception of competencies was lower in the dimensions of analysis and application. More recently graduated physicians seem to have a greater self-perception of their research and analysis skills, probably due to curricular updates.";"[Romero-Robles, Milton A.; Sing-Sanchez, Caroline C.] Univ Nacl Santa, Escuela Med, Ancash, Peru; [Romero-Robles, Milton A.; Soriano-Moreno, David R.; Garcia-Gutierrez, Fabrizio M.; Condori-Meza, I.

In this article, we present the main results of the case-study developed in one of the most historical and relevant virtual universities in an international context.

Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to gather and analyse the data. From 1715 students who participated in the survey and the perceptions of 30 students individually interviewed, the results show positive evaluations regarding the integration and adoption of technological competencies, and also, that the online education generally serves as a responsive model to the emergent needs of the learner.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology was adopted via the case study method through which the case of a sixth-grade Chilean teacher participating in the study was documented. The data were collected through a lesson plan, a videotape of the implemented lesson and a questionnaire. A professional digital competence framework for teachers provided an analytical perspective via data analysis. Findings The results show that the teacher displayed digital competence in a synchronous collaborative learning environment in which she had time to reflect on the educational value of technology and appropriate teaching methods involving information and communication technologies. Certain elements of the studied case contributed to this performance, namely the cross-border context, the classroom setting and the collaborative Lesson Study methodology. Practical implications The lesson study methodology facilitated the teacher's performance in the Pedagogy and didactics digital competence by enabling her to participate in planning and implementing a lesson that allowed all those who collaborated, including teachers and researchers, to reflect on teaching in a digital learning environment. Social implications The cross-border context, which involved co-designing and implementing a lesson in two countries, allowed the teacher to display her School in society and Ethics competencies. This was achieved through connecting two classrooms with different languages and cultures digitally and synchronously, thereby providing students the opportunity to debate and participate in a global and local problem such as a country's responsibility for energy consumption. Originality/value Modern society requires the transformation of school practices, and new teaching approaches should include the provision of collaborative spaces that incorporate digital technologies. In this sense, this paper shows that cross-border lessons involving a synchronous learning environment offer a potential alternative, as digital teaching competence enables teachers to bring together different social and cultural groups virtually, thereby contributing to the reduction of social gaps and to the promotion of positive identity among less advantaged students.;"[Isoda, Masami] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Estrella, Soledad; Zakaryan, Diana; Olfos, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Baldin, Yuriko] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Araya, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Estrella, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;soledad.estrella@pucv.cl;Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022;"estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914; Araya, Roberto/0000-0003-2598-8994";"ANID Fondecyt [1200346]; FONDEF [ID20i10070]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP19K21743, JP26245082]; VRIEA [039.439/2020]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";"The authors are thankful to the support from ANID Fondecyt 1200346; FONDEF ID20i10070; JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K21743, JP26245082; VRIEA 039.439/2020 and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003.";;25;2;2;7;10;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2046-8253;2016-8261;;INT J LESSON LEARN S;Int.

We identified two main areas of possible impact: the potential effects upon doctoral research projects and upon the doctoral students themselves. We followed the learning experiences of science and technology PhD students before, during, and a year after an entrepreneurial course through a multiple case study research design. Our results suggest that entrepreneurship education has a positive impact upon the development of student's creative problem-solving and communication skills. This was reported to have a generally positive effect upon the students' doctoral projects and on the student's self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions.

This study provides evidence from a randomized experiment of a preschool intervention involving 1,876 children in 64 schools in Chile that chronic absenteeism develops in preschool and is predicted by multiple risk factors for poor academic achievement. We find moreover that individual children's likelihood of absenteeism moderated the intervention's impact on children's language and literacy outcomes such that there were positive impacts of the intervention only for children with the lowest likelihood of absenteeism. Experimental evaluations of school-based interventions that do not take absenteeism into account may thus mask heterogeneous effects. In the context of policy pushes to expand early education and preschool access in the United States and globally, these moderation analyses may prove essential for appropriately interpreting the results of experimental studies of school-based interventions.;"[Arbour, MaryCatherine] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arbour, MaryCatherine] Harvard Univ, Ctr Dev Child, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yoshikawa, Hirokazu] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture, New York, NY USA; [Willett, John; Snow, Catherine] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Weiland, Christina] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mendive, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Clara Barata, M.] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Trevino, Ernesto] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile";;Arbour, M (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Global Hlth Equ, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;marbour@partners.org;"Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015";"Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302";"Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago de Chile; Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University; Harvard Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University; UNICEF's Chile country office; Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University; Hearst Early Investigator Award at Brigham and Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Fondecyt Iniciacion ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11100493]; MINEDUC-FONIDE Project [F611106_2011]";The primary funder of this project was the Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago de Chile.

The aim is to reverse the high failure and attrition rate among engineering undergraduates taking physics. A number of tests and questionnaires were administered to a group of students following a traditional lecture-based instruction, as well as to another group that was following an instruction scheme based on the proposed approach and the teaching materials developed ad hoc.

Building on previous work assessing teachers' attitudes, we focus on how pre-service teacher attitudes vary across different dimensions, and how these patterns can inform teacher training. We present results from assessing attitudes towards stochastics and its teaching for a sample of 269 pre-service Chilean mathematics teachers across three topics: descriptive statistics, probability, and statistical inference. Using a quantitative approach, and considering attitudes towards content and pedagogy, we focus on describing the main attitudinal differences among these three areas. In general, we found positive attitude towards the content and its teaching in all three areas, but with differences among them, primarily in the area of statistical inference.

This study compared performance on banked cloze tests using a conventional interface (based on paper-based formats for responding by writing a number in a box) versus cloze tests with improved interfaces (based on computer-based affordances such as dragging and dropping responses to fill in a blank). In a banked cloze test, the left side of the page shows a text with words deleted and replaced with blanks that are numbered, and the right side shows the word list with a space to write in the corresponding number. In Experiment 1, 56 fourth graders in the conventional group responded more slowly but just as accurately, and spent more time looking at the word list on the right of the screen but spent equivalent time looking at the text as compared to a group that took the test with an improved interface. In Experiment 2, the same pattern of results was replicated with 148 sixth graders and for each of three versions of improved interfaces as compared to the conventional interface. Results support the idea that the improved interface affected the response execution phase but not the response development phase of performance on the cloze test.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Econ & Management, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sitthiworachart, Jirarat] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Ind Educ & Technol, 1 Soi Chalongkrung 1, Bangkok 10520, Thailand; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Econ & Management, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.;"hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; jirarat.si@kmitl.ac.th; mario.lopez@usach.cl";Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";;;;40;1;1;3;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1042-1629;1556-6501;;ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES;ETR&D-Educ.

Urban teacher education and rural schools: directors' point of view;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Teacher education; rural education; social justice; Chile; multi-grade classrooms";"DIVERSITY; RIGHTS";Policymakers and teacher educators have long discussed whether specialised preparation of teachers who work in rural areas is necessary. The objective of this research is to learn more about teacher educators' perspectives on the efficacy of urban-based teacher education in preparing elementary school teachers for rural contexts. The research was undertaken in a city in the Araucania region of Chile. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the directors of three teacher education programmes. Those interviewed reported concerns about multi-grade classrooms often found in rural schools, which were understood to be an anomaly of proper elementary education. They also reported that the teacher education programmes they directed, though not aligned with teaching in rural schools, were sufficient in preparing new teachers. Preparation in teaching children in rural settings was not offered, or, in some cases, offered on the periphery as a programme option. This research reveals a disconnect between urban-based, urban-oriented teacher education programmes and the rural communities they aim to serve. It also adds to the broader discussion surrounding the preparation of teachers for diverse contexts.;"[Silva-Pena, Ilich] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile; [Precht, Andrea] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social, Fac Educ, Curico, Chile; [O'Brien, Thomas, V] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Educ, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Jara, Carin] Univ Santo Tomas, Bogota, Colombia";;Silva-Pena, I (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile.;ilichsp@gmail.com;Precht, Andrea/H-4506-2015;"Precht, Andrea/0000-0002-2435-5565; Silva-Pena, Ilich/0000-0001-9118-3989";"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship [611.3]";"This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico: [Grant Number, 1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship 611.3.";;54;1;1;7;19;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

For example, in the UK, 10%-25% of Gypsy children do not attend school regularly and have significantly higher levels of overall absence from school (percentage of half-day sessions missed) than pupils from other ethnic groups. In Portugal, available data on Gypsy children is sparse, yet data from one geographic region of the country reports high school failure (45%) and dropout rates (15%) among this population. The present study assessed the efficacy of a four-year intervention to promote Gypsy children's behavioural engagement and school success. Gypsy communities were contacted and 30 children participating in the four waves were randomly distributed into control and experimental groups. Every school day throughout four years, 16 children in the experimental group were called at home and invited to go to school. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated in four waves (at the end of each of the four school years), assessing behavioural engagement (i.e. school non-attendance, classroom behaviour) and school achievement (i.e. mathematics achievement, student progression). Findings show the efficacy of the intervention on promoting behaviour engagement and academic success without devaluing Gypsy people's culture.;"[Rosario, Pedro; Azevedo, Raquel; Pereira, Raquel; Moreira, Tania] Univ Minho, Dept Appl Psychol, Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunez, Jose; Vallejo, Guillermo] Univ Oviedo, Dept Psychol, Oviedo, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Valle, Antonio] Univ A Coruna, Dept Psychol, La Coruna, Spain";;Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Escola Psicol, P-4710052 Braga, Portugal.;prosario@psi.uminho.pt;"Rosário, Pedro/A-1775-2011; Núñez, José Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Vallejo, Guillermo/B-8233-2011; Núñez, José Carlos/H-4425-2013; Valle, Antonio/A-6776-2013";"Rosário, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Vallejo, Guillermo/0000-0002-8010-6854; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Valle, Antonio/0000-0001-8160-9181; Moreira, Tania/0000-0002-8113-1795; Azevedo, Raquel/0000-0002-5575-7313; Pereira, Ana Raquel/0000-0002-9171-2999";;;;58;10;11;8;44;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0141-1926;1469-3518;;BRIT EDUC RES J;Br.

In Spain and Chile, it is also associated with a long-standing political cleavage on the regulation of large sectors of private-dependent schools. This article analyses both the micro-and the macro-politics of choice in these two countries, where low-status 15-year-old students record a significant segregation. At the micro level, some evidence is provided that not only middle-class skilful choosers but also the political representatives of private-dependent schools manage to pursue their interests drawing on economic, social and cultural capital. At the macro level, evidence also shows that the lobbies defending private-dependent schools can use and maintain these power resources. However, in some episodes collective action is an effective power resource for those who campaign in favour of a stricter regulation of these schools, but its influence is much difficult to maintain for longer periods.;"[Rambla, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Sociol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Valiente, Oscar] OECD, Educ Directorate, Paris, France; [Frias, Carla] Univ Mar del Plata, Fac Educ, San Fernando, Chile";;Rambla, X (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Sociol, Campus Bellaterra,Edifici B, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.;xavier.rambla@uab.cat;"Frias, Carla/I-1102-2013; Rambla, Xavier/F-5346-2016";"Frias, Carla/0000-0002-0766-4761; Rambla, Xavier/0000-0003-1634-4003; valiente, oscar/0000-0001-9590-6822";;;;81;13;14;3;27;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

To analyze the relationship between institutional factors and within-school segregation, it uses a logistic regression, controlling for a set of school characteristics. This analysis finds that within-school segregation is related to institutional factors such as school size and the characteristics of their students. To determine the effects of within-school segregation on academic performance, a multilevel regression model is used, organized in three levels: school, classroom and student. The results show that within-school segregation has negative consequences on educational quality, efficiency and equity, since internal segregation reduces the average educational outcomes of the schools and mostly affects students of middle groups within the school in both academic achievement and socioeconomic terms.

To establish whether analogy making plays a role in this process of learning, we devised a classroom game based on an analysis of a number-line analogy that leverages children' spatial intuitions for helping them understand the numbers. To investigate the role of spatial positioning along the number line, seventy-seven preschoolers were randomly assigned to control tasks (control condition) or to embodied number line tasks in two possible spatial locations: watching numbers increasing either from left to right (space-number alignment condition) or from right to left (space-number misalignment condition) Performing-learning activities for roughly two hours promoted children's proficiency in four tasks of numerical knowledge, but only children under spatial and numerical alignment increased their proficiency in a task of number line estimation. This finding shows that the numerical representations generated by children during training were integrated with spatial information that was implicit in the learning activities, thus revealing that analogical alignments play a key role in the formation of early numerical representations. Additionally, this study illustrates that interrogating the analogy at the foundation of an instructional activity highlights key instructional decisions that can have a large impact on learning. Future research along this line might provide a framework for using analogy at the foundations of instructional design.;"[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile; [Gomez, David M.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, CMM, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile.;jnavarrete@ubiobio.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;"Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751; Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436";"INNOVA-BIO-BIO [13.1984-EM.CIE, 14.541-EM.CIE]; Universidad del Bio-Bio [124009 3/D]; FAPEI Fund; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003, PFB03]; CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003, PFB03]";"This research was supported by the INNOVA-BIO-BIO grants 13.1984-EM.CIE and 14.541-EM.CIE.

The magnitude of the association varies widely across the studies, but the sources of this variation have not been identified. The purpose of this paper is to examine the magnitude and determinants of the relation between arithmetic and reading performance during elementary and middle school years. We meta-analyzed 210 correlations between math and reading measures, coming from 68 independent samples (the overall sample size was 58923 participants). The meta-analysis yielded an average correlation of 0.55 between math and reading measures. Among the moderators tested, only transparency of orthography and use of timed or untimed tests were significant in explaining the size of the correlation, with the largest correlations observed between timed measures of arithmetic and reading and between math and reading in opaque orthographies.;"[Singer, Vivian; Strasser, Kathernie] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Singer, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;vesinger@uc.cl;;Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798;;;;103;12;12;2;24;AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;1045-3830;1939-1560;;SCHOOL PSYCHOL QUART;Sch.

International evidence suggests that these gender differences reflect gender inequities in educational and economic opportunities available in a given culture. A theoretical model suggests that sociocultural factors such as gender stereotype and math anxiety have an impact on women's math abilities by affecting their skills for cognitive reflection. This cross-sectional study collected data from 259 university students to gather preliminary evidence on the close relationship between gender gaps in math achievement and gender gaps in cognitive reflection. A mediation analysis shows that the level of cognitive reflection of students fully mediates the effect of gender on math achievement, even after controlling for participants' linguistic abilities. These findings support the possibility that there is a close relationship between gender differences in cognitive reflection and gender gaps in math achievement at university admission in Chile. The discussion emphasizes that the university admission's data is under the control of state agencies with strict protocols of information access that undermines the feasibility of researching this area. Assessments of cognitive reflection are easy to administer in only a few minutes and under laboratory conditions. Hence, one way to boost the viability of research and diagnosis of gender gaps in Chile is to use cognitive reflection assessments as proximal estimates for gender gaps in math performance at university admission.;"[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Ctr Estudios Nuble, Chillan, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Grp Invest Genero Ciudadania & Equidad GI 170424, Chillan, Chile";;Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile.;"jairo.navarrete@uoh.cl; jsandoval@ubiobio.cl";Sandoval-Díaz, José/AAT-3262-2021;"Sandoval-Díaz, José/0000-0001-7247-7113; Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [19I10030];This research was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de Chile, by funding of Program FONDEF Grant ID19I10030.;;62;0;0;1;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1381-2890;1573-1928;;SOC PSYCHOL EDUC;Soc.

Specifically, the instructional use of language would be the means for concept development. However, there is evidence to show that school concepts are particularly difficult to develop. Argumentation has been shown to promote the development of school concepts, but why is this the case? Although there are different theoretical accounts for this effect, none of them are developed from an explicit notion of what it is to understand and develop a concept. The purpose of this paper is to revisit these accounts in light of dialogical theories of meaning comprehension in order to shed light on this old problem. After discussing conceptual change and Vygotsky's theory of concept development, a dialogical notion of meaning comprehension informed by Bakhtin is discussed. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that imagination plays a central role in concept development and that argumentation is a powerful means for imagining.;[Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile;;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516;Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140995];This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) project no. 1140995.;;67;9;9;0;16;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0256-2928;1878-5174;;EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC;Eur.

They took a test of divergent thinking, a test of creative problem solving and a fluid intelligence test. Additionally, they answered mind wandering, metacognition, and reading difficulties self-report scales. We performed multivariate analyses of variance, hierarchical regression models and tests of moderation. Fluid intelligence predicted performance on both creativity tests. The reading difficulties scale predicted the test of creative problem solving but not the test of divergent thinking. Mind wandering significantly predicted both creativity measures above the contribution of fluid intelligence and reading difficulties. Metacognition did not significantly predict the measures of creativity. The type of school where the participants studied moderated the effect of metacognition on creativity. We discuss the implications of these results for research and assessment on mind wandering, metacognition and creativity.

This tendency has resulted in cannabis consumption being accepted by society as if it were harmless. However, evidence shows that the use of this drug has detrimental effects on cognitive, academic, and professional performance, which tend to be larger in younger users (e.g., high school students). In this review article, we focus on the decline of visuospatial processing associated with cannabis consumption in nondependent or nonclinical high school students. We start by providing evidence of the pivotal role of visuospatial processing for learning. Next, we review experimental and correlational evidence of declines in visuospatial processing related to cannabis use. Three types of correlational studies are considered: (a) comparisons of declines between visuospatial processing and other cognitive tasks, (b) studies comparing declines between high school students and adult participants, and (c) stringent correlational studies (e.g., large samples, longitudinal data, twin studies). We also include evidence in abstinent cannabis conditions. We conclude that using cannabis may moderately impair visuospatial processing and learning in nondependent high school students, although the effects could disappear under abstinence and tend to be lower than on other cognitive functions. Instructional implications for educators and future research directions are discussed.;"[Goycolea, Rodrigo] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Santiago, Chile; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Dorr, Anneliese] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat & Mental Hlth, Santiago, Chile";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"rodrigo.goycolea@ucentral.cl; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; adorr@med.uchile.cl";;Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]";Funding received was from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255.;;74;0;0;1;10;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

A Longitudinal Study;SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"COVID-19; emotional and behavioral disorders; externalizing and internalizing problems; special educational needs; socioeconomic status";"MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; COVID-19";This study investigated the repercussions of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the subsequent quarantine on the emotional well-being of children in their initial years of formal schooling, with particular emphasis on children with special educational needs (SEN) and children from high and low socioeconomic statuses (SES). This longitudinal study employed the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 (CBCL) completed by the students' guardians at least once during 2018-2019 and again during 2020. The results showed differences in internalizing and externalizing problems after 8 months of quarantine and a significant increase in students fitting clinical or borderline categories given by the CBCL itself. The results are described in detail for four groups considering the combination of SEN and SES characteristics, showing the importance of their intersectionality, especially between low SES and SEN. Impact and Implications This work represents a rapid effort to inquire about the socio-emotional well-being of Chilean schoolers during extensive periods of quarantines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis considered how groups with different educational needs and SES have changed their well-being since 2018-2019 compared to 2020. This research calls attention to the need to respond with evidence-based data for those more affected. Results implicate that Chilean school-children have seen the most critical diminishing of their socio-emotional well-being during this time.

J;Preiss, DD;;;;Preiss, David D.;;;The Chilean instructional pattern for the teaching of language: A video-survey study based on a national program for the assessment of teaching;LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Instructional pattern; Folk pedagogy; Teaching competency; Chile";;I investigated the instructional pattern for the teaching of language at the elementary school level in Chile. The data were obtained from analyzing videos filmed for a teaching assessment system implemented by the Chilean Government. The system identified four levels of teacher competence. I treated these levels of competence as an independent factor. The dependents variables of interest were frequency of teacher questions and follow-ups in four categories, social organization of the lesson and time on task. Most of teachers studied are clearly aligned with an adult-rum model of education. Evidence for adherence to this pedagogical approach can be found in (a) teacher questioning and teacher reactions to students' contributions, and (b) the place accorded to the teacher in the social organization of the lesson. The teaching pattern uncovered has its roots in the intuitive pedagogics endorsed by Chilean teachers, which in turn rest on Chilean cultural models of pedagogy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The research sought to examine the association between parental motivational beliefs, parental perceptions of invitations for involvement, and parental perceived life context, and parental at-home and at-school involvement when controlling for child, parent, and household characteristics. Results from this study indicate that child invitations for involvement, parental sense of self-efficacy, income, and child's grade level are significantly associated with parental at home and at school involvement. Time and energy was also significantly associated with parental at school involvement.

One factor that may explain some of these results is male and female students' motivation towards reading and books. The present study examined gender-related factors that contribute to explain students' reading motivation. One hundred and fifteen Chilean secondary students completed measures of reading motivation, gender identity and reading gender stereotypes. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that after controlling for language arts achievement, female students exhibited higher levels of reading motivation, in both dimensions: self-concept and value. Paired samples t-tests showed that all participants, male and female, viewed reading as a more feminine endeavor, revealing reading gender stereotypes. A multiple regression analysis showed that reading gender stereotypes explained significant variance in students' reading self-concept. Expressive identity traits (stereotypically feminine) as well as self-reported sexism both explained significant variance in the value that students associated with reading. The study offers empirical evidence about a relevant but understudied topic, especially in this region.

It connects emergent literacy research with historical-cultural and bioecological concepts. Subsequently, it focuses on the problem of the development of profiles of cognitive reading precursors. A sample of 63 Chilean adults was studied through a growth/learning curves approach. The study replicated previous results indicating the existence of three major profiles of these cognitive precursors. Together, these precursors are associated with significantly different learning curves beyond the effect of each precursor considered separately. In addition, it established a negative association between initial phonological awareness and the rate of reading acquisition during the course. It has been claimed that an individual's participation in specific cultural activities throughout his/her life influences the development of the precursors of reading. Based on a complementary biographical study of a subsample of participants, preliminary evidence is presented that supports this link. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, assessing the quality of life (QOL) of nursing students is important to determine if they have excellent well-being levels as they go through the learning process. Objectives: This study measured and compared QOL of respondents by country of residence, and identified the QOL predictors of students. Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional design. Settings: A multi-country study conducted in Chile, Egypt, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United States of America. Participants: A convenience sample of 2012 Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire containing demographic characteristic items and the World Health Organization QOL-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) was used to gather data from respondents. Results: The highest overall QOL was recorded in the physical health domain, whereas the lowest was in the social health domain. The perceived highest and lowest QOL dimension varied between countries. Age, country of residence, and monthly family income showed statistically significant multivariate effect on the aspects of QOL. Conclusions: Considering their stressful lives, the present study underscores the importance of ensuring the highest level of well-being among nursing students. The maintenance of high levels of well-being among nursing students should also be prioritized to maximize their learning and ensure their satisfaction in their student life.;"[Cruz, Jonas Preposi] Shaqra Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Al Dawadmi, Saudi Arabia; [Felicilda-Reynaldo, Rhea Faye D.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Nursing & Dent Hyg, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lam, Simon Ching] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Faulty Hlth & Social Sci, Sch Nursing, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Machuca Contreras, Felipe Aliro] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Carrera Enfermeria, Santiago, Chile; [Machuca Contreras, Felipe Aliro] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Salud & Odontol, Escuela Enfermeria, Santiago, Chile; [Cecily, Helen Shaji John] Majmaah Univ, Dept Nursing, Majmaah, Saudi Arabia; [Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.] Technol Educ Inst Thessaly, Dept Nursing, Larisa, Thessaly, Greece; [Fouly, Howieda A.] Assiut Univ, Fac Nursing, Assiut, Egypt; [Kamau, Simon Macharia] Univ Kabianga, Nursing Sci Dept, Kericho, Kenya; [Valdez, Glenn Ford D.] Salalah Nursing Inst, Dept Nursing, Salalah City, Oman; [Adams, Kathryn A.] Missouri State Univ, Sch Nursing, Springfield, MO USA; [Colet, Paolo C.] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Med, Astana, Kazakhstan";;Cruz, JP (corresponding author), Shaqra Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Nursing, Al Dawadmi, Saudi Arabia.;"cruzjpm@gmail.com; rff@hawaii.edu; simlc@alumni.cuhk.net; felipe.machuca@uautonoma.cl; h.cecily@mu.edu.sa; iopapathanasiou@yahoo.gr; hoida.elfouly@aun.edu.eg; symomash@gmail.com; glennfordvaldez@yahoo.com; KathyAdams@missouristate.edu; paolo.colet@nu.edu.kz";"Contreras, Felipe Machuca/U-7100-2018; Cruz, Jonas Preposi/F-2665-2015; shaji, Helen/N-2308-2019; Colet, Paolo C./W-8804-2019; Valdez, Glenn Ford/AAF-4051-2021; Fouly, Howieda Ahmed Abdelmohimen/Y-7279-2019; Lam, Simon Ching/H-7361-2019";"Contreras, Felipe Machuca/0000-0001-7119-8593; Cruz, Jonas Preposi/0000-0002-3758-1414; shaji, Helen/0000-0003-3006-2029; Colet, Paolo C./0000-0002-6503-2244; Fouly, Howieda Ahmed Abdelmohimen/0000-0001-7060-764X; Lam, Simon Ching/0000-0002-2982-9192; Papathanasiou, Ioanna V./0000-0002-8874-8085; Valdez, Glenn Ford/0000-0002-2799-8216";;;;38;16;17;1;22;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

This paper presents the background, methods and results of a new simulation management game called LEBSCO, which simulates aspects of the Last Planner System (LPS) and Lean Production principles. LPS is central to the implementation of Lean Construction, an increasingly popular management approach based on the Toyota Production System and Lean Production. LPS requires continuous and collaborative effort from all stakeholders for the planning and control of a construction project, making it especially appropriate for the experiential learning allowed by simulation. LEBSCO consists of the assembly of Lego pieces to form a schematic house, and it is played by teams meeting in rounds simulating weeks of work. Each team is composed of stakeholders, such as a planner, resource suppliers and trade foremen, mirroring the planning and control process of a typical construction project. Participants build the Lego houses first using a Traditional management approach and then using Lean-based approach. A graduate course in construction management at The University of Auckland, New Zealand, is used as a case study to test the effectiveness of LEBSCO as a teaching method. The implementation results of LESBCO demonstrated its capability to transfer and disseminate Lean-based knowledge into construction.

The implementation of m-learning in the learning process followed the ARCS model and was evaluated using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS). The Google Science Journal mobile application was used by the students in this study to determine the acceleration vector of a previously selected motor vehicle. The IMMS allowed us to measure the motivation of the kinematics and dynamics students from the Civil Engineering Department at Universidad Catolica del Maule. The instrument's reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha, giving an overall value of 0.89. The implementation of m-learning in university classrooms was positively valued by the majority of students surveyed, and it increased the percentage of students who achieved the expected learning objectives compared to previous versions of the course (without m-learning). Finally, this study provides a validated measurement model and solid scientific references, which aim to stimulate the use of m-learning. It has been shown that the implementation of m-learning favorably stimulates students, their interest in learning kinematics, and their confidence in themselves.;"[Laurens Arredondo, Luis A.; Valdes Riquelme, Hugo] Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Maule, Chile";;Riquelme, HV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile.;hvaldes@ucm.cl;Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/ABF-3959-2021;Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/0000-0002-2140-6275;;;;71;1;1;3;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

The study also addresses the role of imagery in viewing comprehension by distinguishing between audio-based, audio plus imagery-based, and imagery-based comprehension questions. Learners' lexical coverage was determined by measuring participants' knowledge of the words occurring in the documentary in an aural-meaning recall test, whereas viewing comprehension was measured by means of literal and inferential comprehension questions. One hundred and fourteen EFL learners took part in the study. Results showed an almost medium-sized correlation between lexical coverage and viewing comprehension (r(s) (94) = .39). Results also showed a positive almost medium-sized correlation between audio-based questions and lexical coverage (r(s) (94) = .36), and a small-sized correlation between imagery-based questions and lexical coverage (r(s) (94) = .29). No relationship was observed between lexical coverage and imagery plus audio-based questions. No threshold for minimum comprehension was observed. The results indicate that the lexical demands for viewing are lower than those for reading but similar to those for listening. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed.

Adult English as a foreign language learners from intact classes (N = 83) were assigned to four conditions: metacognitive instruction plus input-providing recasts, input-providing recasts only, metacognitive instruction plus output-prompting clarification requests, and output-prompting clarification requests only. Metacognitive instruction enhanced the effect of conversational recasts that otherwise had minimal impact but had no added benefit for clarification requests that supported language development without metacognitive instruction. Although the effect of metacognitive instruction was not moderated by linguistic structure, effectiveness of corrective feedback depended on linguistic target. Although corrective feedback in general impacted third-person singular -s more, the comparison of feedback types showed that the advantageous effect of clarification requests was found only for possessive determiners, the more salient and communicatively valuable structure.;"[Sato, Masatoshi; Loewen, Shawn] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Sato, Masatoshi; Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.;masatoshi.sato@unab.cl;Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [1160838];We would like to thank the four teachers who were generous enough to give access to their students and participate in the intensive feedback training sessions.

Method The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL in May 2016, for comparative research studies. For manual analysis of abstracts and main texts, they randomly sampled 250 HPER reports published in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, and 100 biomedical research reports published in 1985 and 2015. Automated computerized analysis of abstracts included all HPER reports published 1970-2015. Results In the 2015 HPER sample, P values were reported in 69/100 abstracts and 94 main texts. CIs were reported in 6 abstracts and 22 main texts. Most P values (>= 77%) were <=.05. Across all years, 60/164 two-group HPER studies had >= 80% power to detect a betweengroup difference of 0.5 standard deviations. From 1985 to 2015, the proportion of HPER abstracts reporting a CI did not change significantly (odds ratio [OR] 2.87; 95% CI 1.04, 7.88) whereas that of main texts reporting a CI increased (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.39, 2.78). Comparison with biomedical studies revealed similar reporting of P values, but more frequent use of CIs in biomedicine. Automated analysis of 56,440 HPER abstracts found 14,867 (26.3%) reporting a P value, 3,024 (5.4%) reporting a CI, and increased reporting of P values and CIs from 1970 to 2015. Conclusions P values are ubiquitous in HPER, CIs are rarely reported, and most studies are underpowered. Most reported P values would be considered statistically significant.";"[Cook, David A.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Mayo 17,200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.; Cook, David A.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Escuela Med, Santiago, Chile; [Serrano, Valentina P.] Mayo Clin, Knowledge & Evaluat Res Unit, Div Endocrinol Diabet Metab & Nutr, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Serrano, Valentina P.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Nutr Diabet & Metab, Escuela Med, Santiago, Chile; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Utah, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Spencer S Eccles Hlth Sci Lib, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Utah, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Systemat Review Core, Populat Hlth Res Fdn Discovery, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Pandian, T.

Consenting volunteer students were trained to observe each other whilst working in the skills laboratory (Year-2) and in the dental clinic (Year-5). Subsequently, they followed a structured protocol of peer assessment and peer feedback using specially designed work-based forms during a complete academic year. The content of their written feedback was coded according to the UK General Dental Council domain, sign (positive or negative), specificity (task specific or general), and grouped into themes. ResultsA total of 108 participants (40 Year-2 and 68 Year-5) completed 1169 peer assessment work-based forms (516 pre-clinical and 653 clinical); 94% contained written feedback. The large majority (82%) of Year-2 feedback represented the clinical domain, 89% were positive, 77% were task specific, and they were grouped into 14 themes. Year-5 feedback was related mostly to Management and Leadership (37%) and Communication (32%), 64% were positive, 75% task specific, and they were clustered into 24 themes. DiscussionThe content of the feedback showed notable differences between Year-2 and Year-5 students. Senior students focused more on Communication and Management and Leadership skills, whilst juniors were more concerned with clinical skills. Year-5 students provided 13% negative feedback compared to only 2% from Year-2. Regulatory focus theory is discussed to explain these differences. Both groups provided peer feedback on a wide and different range of themes. However, four themes emerged in both groups: efficiency, infection control, time management and working speed. ConclusionA structured peer assessment framework can be used to guide pre-clinical and clinical students to provide peer feedback focused on different domains, and on contrasting signs and specificities. It can also present an opportunity to complement tutors' feedback.";"[Tricio, J.; Woolford, M.; Escudier, M.] Kings Coll London, Inst Dent, London, England; [Tricio, J.] Univ Andes, Fac Dent, Ave Mons Alvaro del Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile";;Tricio, J (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Fac Dent, Ave Mons Alvaro del Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile.;jtricio@uandes.cl;Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013;Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828;;;;41;5;5;2;17;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the reliability, accuracy, educational impact and student's perceptions of undergraduate pre-clinical and clinical dental students' structured and prospective Peer assessment and peer feedback protocol. Materials and methodsTwo Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) forms were modified for use in pre-clinical and clinical peer assessment. Ten year two dental students working in a phantom-heads skills laboratory and 16-year five dental students attending a comprehensive care clinic piloted both peer DOPS forms. After training, pairs of students observed, assessed and provided immediate feedback to each other using their respective peer DOPS forms as frameworks. At the end of the 3-month study period, students anonymously provided their perceptions of the protocol. ResultsYear 2 and year 5 students completed 57 and 104 peer DOPS forms, respectively. The generalizability coefficient was 0.62 for year 2 (six encounters) and 0.67 for year 5 (seven encounters). Both groups were able to differentiate amongst peer-assessed domains and so detect improvement in peers' performance over time. Peer DOPS scores of both groups showed a positive correlation with their mean end-of-year examination marks (r0.505, P0.051) although this was not statistically significant. There was no difference (P0.094) between the end-of-year examination marks of the participating students and the rest of their respective classes. The vast majority of both groups expressed positive perceptions of the piloted protocol. DiscussionThere are no data in the literature on the prospective use of peer assessment in the dental undergraduate setting. In the current study, both pre-clinical and clinical students demonstrated the ability to identify those domains where peers performed better, as well as those which needed improvement. Despite no observable educational impact, most students reported positive perceptions of the peer DOPS protocol.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the levels of reflection habits of dental students and clinical and PhD postgraduate trainees and to establish the relationship between students' reflection and their academic performance. Materials and MethodsA total of 324 subjects (208 females, 56% 23years of age) from King's College London Dental Institute, consisting of 281 undergraduate and 43 postgraduate trainees, responded to the invitation to participate and completed an online self-reported Reflection Questionnaire; this assesses two levels of non-reflective actions (Habitual Action and Understanding) and two levels of reflective actions (Reflection and Critical Reflection). Reflection results were compared amongst different cohorts and correlated with students' academic performance. ResultsReflection Questionnaire mean scores were 10.7 for Habitual Action, 17.3 for Understanding, 17.0 for Reflection and 14.4 for Critical Reflection, with significant differences between cohorts of undergraduate students, clinical postgraduates and PhD trainees. Reflection and Critical Reflection mean scores were higher as students climbed courses. Further, those 24years of age and those with previous university degrees demonstrated higher reflective habits, whilst there was no gender difference. Additionally, the assessment programme methods correlated differently to the Reflection Questionnaire scores. DiscussionThe Reflection Questionnaire's internal reliability was acceptable. The most common approaches used by both students and trainees were Understanding and Reflection, whilst those with high Understanding scores also tended to have good Reflective scores. Further, multiple choice questions encouraged students to understand', whilst ill-defined problems, such as those from essays to clinical reasoning cases, increased this to the reflection scale. ConclusionTo foster reflective thinking, tutoring should primarily be focused on younger students (23years old) and those without a previous university degree.

We measured the applied managerial knowledge of 21,319 managers and 2,644 students and found a disturbingly low level of such capability in both groups. Moreover, our findings indicated little difference in demonstrated applied managerial knowledge across a wide range of management experience. In our student sample, we found only modest to small relationships between applied managerial knowledge and measures of cognitive aptitude, select personality characteristics, and academic performance. Despite an immense amount of educational resources devoted to its development, applied managerial knowledge is clearly elusive.

Aim: The aim of this research was to identify the instruments used to measure the educational environment in health professions education and to assess their validity and reliability. Methods: We performed an electronic search in the medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE) and Timelit (Topics in medical education) databases through to October 2008. The non-electronic search (hand searching) was conducted through reviewing the references of the retrieved studies and identifying the relevant ones. Two independent authors read, rated and selected studies for the review according to the pre-specified criteria. The inter-rater agreement was measured with Kappa coefficient. Results: Seventy-nine studies were included with the Kappa coefficient of 0.79, which demonstrated a reliable process, and 31 instruments were extracted. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure, Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure, Clinical Learning Environment and Supervision and Dental Student Learning Environment Survey are likely to be the most suitable instruments for undergraduate medicine, postgraduate medicine, nursing and dental education, respectively. Conclusions: As a valid and reliable instrument is available for each educational setting, a study to assess the educational environment should become a part of an institution's good educational practice. Further studies employing a wider range of databases with more elaborated search strategies will increase the comprehensiveness of the systematic review.;"[Soemantri, Diantha] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia; [Herrera, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Hlth Policy & Syst Res Unit, Santiago, Chile; [Herrera, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Evidence Based Med Unit, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile";;Soemantri, D (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.;dianthasoemantri@yahoo.com;;Herrera, Cristian/0000-0002-6219-7975;National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [11004336];The authors thank Sue Roff and Sean McAleer for their comments and support in completing the project and finalizing the manuscript.

Consequently, the influence of the clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students' intrinsic motivation. The aim of this study was to describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. MethodsA qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. FindingsSeveral themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and constructive feedback; delivery of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. ConclusionsOur findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomy-supportive style to motivate their patients.";"[Orsini, C.; Evans, P.; Binnie, V.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, FEN, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Ledezma, P.; Fuentes, F.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Santiago, Chile";;Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, 27 Hillhead St, Glasgow G12 8PX, Lanark, Scotland.;corsini@fen.uchile.cl;Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019;"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-2087-6662";;;;45;19;20;1;53;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Gamification is a technique that has been shown to improve engagement, transferring the positive effects of videogames. However, the mobile games industry has identified that player retention decreases quickly over time, but it is unclear if this decreasing retention pattern transfers to gamification activities. To check if the behavioral engagement was stable over a 14-week engineering course, we gamified an existing virtual learning environment (VLE), conducting an observational study for two semesters. Actions performed by students within the VLE were used to measure behavioral engagement, which allows us to track student behavior weekly. To analyze the gamification effect, we divided user actions into two groups: academic and gamified. The results showed that the gamified actions performed by students in the VLE decreased every week, which was significantly higher than the decrease in academic actions. This shows that the decreasing retention pattern seen in mobile games was also present in this study. These results suggest that, just like in mobile games, to sustain the behavioral engagement over a long period of time in a gamified class, additional modern game-design techniques should be considered.;"[Corvalan, Benjamin; Recabarren, Matias; Echeverria, Alejandro] Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile";;Recabarren, M (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile.;mrecabarren@miuandes.cl;Recabarren, Matias/AAZ-5945-2021;;CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11130067];The present research has been sponsored by CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt Iniciacion N degrees 11130067).;;41;3;3;3;22;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

As educators, we think that crowdcoding could be leveraged as part of the learning path of engineering students from a computer programming introductory course to solve local community problems. The benefits are twofold: on the one hand the students practice the concepts learned in class and, on the other hand, they participate in real-life problems. Nevertheless, several challenges arise when developing a crowdcoding platform, the first one being how to check the correctness of student's code without giving an extra burden to the professors in the course. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel system that does not resort to expert review; neither requires knowing the right answers beforehand. The proposed scheme automatically clusters the student's codes based solely on the output they produce.

However, current efforts do not provide a comprehensive view of the way their students learn music before starting university. The objective of this study is to portray their musical experiences, identifying the distinctive mechanisms underlying the relationship between practices, repertoires, and training contexts for music learning. A combination of pedagogical, social and musical dimensions, inspired by sociological theories of P. Bourdieu and B. Bernstein, examine the pre-university musical experiences and the mediating role of students' sociocultural origins. Empirically, multimodal information from four Chilean universities (n = 55) was collected through the application of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed using a set of mixed techniques, including descriptive statistics, text mining, and content analysis. Findings reveal relevant associations between practices, repertoires, and learning contexts, especially in terms of the specialized nature of musical training and the habitus and cultural dispositions of practitioners. Particularly relevant is the predominance of informal and non-formal learning contexts and their translation into specific types of learning.

Method General surgery interns and research fellows completed four repetitions of a simulated laparoscopic knot-tying task at one-month intervals. Midway between repetitions, participants received via e-mail either a TD video (demonstration by an expert) or a PF video (video of their own performance with voiceover from a blinded senior surgeon). Each participant received at least one video per format, with sequence randomly assigned. Outcomes included performance scores and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of repeated practice, scores from these trainees on a separate delayed retention test were compared against historical controls who did not have scheduled repetitions. Results Twenty-one trainees completed the randomized study. Mean change in performance scores was significantly greater for those receiving PF (difference = 23.1 of 150 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0, 46.2], P = .05). Perceived workload was also significantly reduced (difference = -3.0 of 20 [95% CI: -5.8, -0.3], P = .04). Compared with historical controls (N = 93), the 21 with scheduled repeated practice had higher scores on the laparoscopic knot-tying assessment two weeks after the final repetition (difference = 1.5 of 10 [95% CI: 0.2, 2.8], P = .02).

Furthermore, classroom walls could be considered valuable resources to introduce visual literacy among children and teachers. However, Chilean educational policies tend not to pay much attention to visual culture in the classroom. Hence, the selection of visual images displayed on classroom walls as well as the way they are exhibited should be more carefully thought through. Under the assumption that visual resources are pedagogically significant elements, the present investigation examined the images displayed on the classroom walls of the first year of primary schools in the district of Penalolen in Santiago, Chile. We present a comparative analysis of visual environments found in different administrative types of schools (municipal, subsidised and fully private schools), using a qualitative method, as well as a quantification of the sample schools. The analysis shows that inequality between types of schools reproduces in images, favouring private schools in aspects such as the degree of planning of the visual environment, student participation in terms of production, the aesthetic quality of the images and its iconographic variety.;"[Errazuriz, Luis] Inst Estet, Jaime Guzman Errazuriz 3300,Campus Oriente, Santiago 6650008, Chile; [Portales, Carlos] Slaters Steps, Morgan Court, Flat 5 Room C, Edinburgh EH8 8PB, Midlothian, Scotland";;Errazuriz, L (corresponding author), Inst Estet, Jaime Guzman Errazuriz 3300,Campus Oriente, Santiago 6650008, Chile.;"lerrazur@uc.cl; carlosportalesg@gmail.com";;;National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT: Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientiifica y Tecnologica) [1120058];This article is part of the research 'Everyday aesthetics in schools of Penalolen' (La estetica cotidiana en establecimientos escolares de la comuna de Penalolen), awarded with the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT: Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientiifica y Tecnologica), Project No. 1120058, (2012-2013).;;26;0;0;1;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1476-8062;1476-8070;;INT J ART DES EDUC;Int.

In addition, we find that political affiliation is an important moderator of preferences for equality. While both Democrats and Republicans are willing to trade over $4,000 to increase higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation, Democrats are willing to sacrifice nearly three times more income to decrease either rich/poor gaps in higher education enrollment or the 90/10 income inequality ratio by 1 standard deviation.";"[Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Shores, Kenneth A.] Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";;"Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Shores, KA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.";"blara@utalca.cl; kshores@psu.edu";Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019;Shores, Kenneth/0000-0003-3039-420X;;;;43;0;0;0;1;MIT PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA;1557-3060;1557-3079;;EDUC FINANC POLICY;Educ.

Our aim is to identify the ideological basis of these campaigns through their representations of predominant actors, which have been systematized to identify possible mistakes and to help determine more effective actions with a greater capacity for mobilization. We applied a mixed content analysis combined with a semiotic model to evaluate the presence or absence of the different actors and their relevance in each case. Several lines of discourse have been reiterated accross the 50 campaigns analysed: Curbing the demand for prostitution as a priority objective; the centrality of victims in the representations; the role of the consumer of paid sex as an accomplice to the crime; and the correlation between prostitution and human trafficking. We will also examine how these issues relate to the broader dispute on the status of prostitution in Spain.

The aim is to establish a standardized, compatible and flexible European university system that enables graduates and undergraduates to move easily from one institution to another within Europe. As a result of evaluation mechanisms, the system will be transparent and of high quality, which will make it attractive and competitive internationally in a globalized world. In this paper, we focus on two distance learning modes that will become more important as a result of this change in universities: e-learning and b-learning. These basically involve the virtualization of learning processes through the use of computer equipment. We carried out a qualitative study using the case study method. The results indicate that teaching staff use information and communication technology (ICT) to improve student learning. Similarly, a high percentage (78%) of lecturers use some form of digital platform as a support for teaching.

The latter was based on the self-determination theory's concepts of differentiation of autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation. MethodsA cross-sectional correlational study was conducted where 924 students completed self-reported questionnaires measuring motivation, perception of the learning climate, feedback and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha scores and bivariate correlations were computed. Mediation of basic needs on each predictor-outcome association was tested based on a series of regression analyses. Finally, all variables were integrated into one structural equation model, controlling for the effects of age, gender and year of study. ResultsCronbach's alpha scores were acceptable (.655 to .905). Correlation analyses showed positive and significant associations between both an autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback received, and students' autonomous motivation, which decreased and became negative when correlated with controlled motivation and amotivation, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that these associations were indirect and mediated by how these predictors satisfied students' basic psychological needs. These results were corroborated by the structural equation analysis, in which data fit the model well and regression paths were in the expected direction. ConclusionAn autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback were positive predictors of students' autonomous motivation and negative predictors of amotivation. However, this was an indirect association mediated by the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs. Consequently, supporting students' needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness might lead to optimal types of motivation, which has an important influence on dental education.;"[Orsini, C.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, Teaching & Learning Ctr, FEN, Santiago, Chile; [Binnie, V.; Wilson, S.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Med Dent & Nursing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";;Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Santiago, Chile.;cesar.orsini@gmail.com;Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019;"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812";Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream;Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream 2015-2016;;41;13;13;4;43;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Objectives This study's main objectives were to determine whether the curriculum and the faculty teaching practices of the School of Dentistry at the University of Chile contribute to its students' commitment to ethical and social responsibility. Methods This was a qualitative study that investigated the perceptions of sixteen subjects (eight students and eight faculty members). Data were collected in thorough deep interviews. The interview process model conceptualised and organised the information into sets of dimensions and categories. The dimensions studied were ethical commitment and social responsibility. The categories assessed within ethical commitment were honesty, tolerance, responsibility and respect. In the social responsibility dimension, the categories were solidarity, teamwork and concern for and communication with the patient. Analysis of the textual data was performed using a method of content analysis based upon constructed qualitative matrices. Results Our results show that students and scholars alike realise that ethical commitment and a sense of social responsibility are not promoted in the curriculum. They do, however, recognise the importance of these qualities in dental practitioners. Conclusions These results indicate that the current curriculum and teaching practices used in our School of Dentistry need to be reviewed and that programmes promoting professionals' commitment to their role in society need to be implemented.;"[Gonzalez, F.

The study aimed to investigate the utility of the Structured Professional Reasoning Exercise (SPRE), a new competence assessment method designed to measure dental students' clinical reasoning in simulated scenarios, covering the clinical areas of Oral Disease, Primary Dental Care and Restorative Dentistry, Child Dental Health and Dental Practice and Clinical Governance. Materials and MethodsA total of 313year-5 students sat for the assessment. Students spent 45minutes assimilating the scenarios, before rotating through four pairs of 39 trained examiners who each independently assessed a single scenario over a ten-minute period, using a structured marking sheet. After the assessment, all students and examiners were invited to complete an anonymous perception questionnaire of the exercise. These questionnaires and the examination scores were statistically analysed. Results and DiscussionOral Disease showed the lowest scores; Dental Practice and Governance the highest. The overall Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was 0.770, whilst examiner training helped to increase the ICC from 0.716 in 2013 to 0.835 in 2014. Exploratory factor analysis revealed one major factor with an eigenvalue of 2.75 (68.8% of total variance). The Generalizability coefficient was consistent at 0.806. A total of 295 students and 32 examiners completed the perception questionnaire. Students' lowest examination perceptions were an Unpleasant and Unenjoyable experience, whilst the highest were Interesting, Valuable and Important. The majority of students and examiners reported the assessment as acceptable, fair and valid. ConclusionThe SPRE offers a reliable, valid and acceptable assessment method, provided it comprises at least four scenarios with two independently marking and trained assessors. 3.";"[Escudier, M.

We find that first time teachers perform significantly worse than their peers, and we find substantial class size effects. Hence higher education institutions face a tradeoff if they wish to increase admission. This tradeoff implies that as class size increases, at first the negative class size effect is smaller than that of introducing a first time teacher. However, beyond a certain level, the class size effect dominates and it is better to create a new class with a first time teacher? (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Implementing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that repeating an early grade in primary school decreases the probability of committing a crime as a juvenile by 14.5 percentage points. By estimating and simulating a dynamic model, we show that the RD result is mainly driven by two mechanisms related to the timing of grade retention. First, grade retention in early grades decreases the probability of grade retention in late primary school grades. Second, late grade retention in primary education has a positive and more relevant effect on crime than the direct effect in early grades. Our findings support the argument that, conditional on the decision to keep grade retention as an ongoing policy, the optimal implementation at the margin is to retain students in early grades in order to avoid retention in later ones.;"[Diaz, Juan] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management Control & Informat Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas; Rivera, Jorge] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes, Tatiana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;"juadiaz@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl; tatiana_reyes@berkeley.edu; jrivera@econ.uchile.cl";;;;;;39;0;0;6;6;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

Children's aptitude to recognize persuasive intent was measured in a selection of examples taken for this study, as well as the perception that parents or guardians had about the minor's ability to recognize advertising on the platforms analyzed. Results were obtained from a survey applied to dyads in 501 homes in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago de Chile, to children aged 10 to 14 and to one of their parents or guardians. Main results include the notion that more than 50% of children were not able to detect advertising in examples containing ads. Lower recognition percentages were obtained in cases that combined persuasive content and entertainment and were not classified as advertising. For their part, adults perceived that their children recognize persuasive intent to a lesser extent than indicated by the children themselves. An explicit and clear signaling of advertising messages, as well as advertising literacy according to the age of minors could help them discern the content they consume on social networks.;"[Feijoo, Beatriz] Univ Int Rioja, Fac Empresa & Comunicac, Logrono, Spain; [Bugueno, Simon] Visiona, Santiago, Chile; [Sadaba, Charo] Univ Navarra, Fac Comunicac, Pamplona, Spain; [Garcia-Gonzalez, Aurora] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Comunicac, Vigo, Spain";;Feijoo, B (corresponding author), Univ Int Rioja, Fac Empresa & Comunicac, Logrono, Spain.;;"Feijoo, Beatriz/B-3909-2017; Sadaba, Charo/H-3121-2015; Garcia-Gonzalez, Aurora/B-2572-2015";"Feijoo, Beatriz/0000-0001-5287-3813; Sadaba, Charo/0000-0003-2596-2794; Bugueno, Simon/0000-0003-4483-1458; Garcia-Gonzalez, Aurora/0000-0003-3757-9047";;;;34;2;3;7;35;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;APR;2021;29;67;;;;;;;;10.3916/C67-2021-08;;;11;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";QF2FF;WOS:000616714100008;;Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

We applied multiple analyses of variance to analyse how motivational variables differ depending on students' social class. The results suggest that social class has an overall medium-size effect on motivational factors with self-efficacy beliefs being the most strongly related to socio-economic status. The most important differences in motivation, self-regulation and learner autonomy were found between upper-middle and high social class students on the one hand and low and lower middle class students on the other hand, which we explained with reference to the inequality created by the Chilean schooling system.

We estimate higher education returns for those who attended and compare them with those of individuals who are at the margin of attending. Following the (Carneiro and Heckman, 2002) reasoning, if the returns of the latter group are larger than those of the former one we could be in presence of unobservable barriers to higher education access, such as credit constraints. We use a rich administrative database composed of three sources: data of enrollment and graduation from the Chilean higher education system, test scores and labor market outcomes from the Chilean Unemployment Insurance database. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of credit constraints for enrolling into the Chilean Higher Education system. However, we do find some evidence of credit constraints in graduation.

A pilot study;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"comparative study; dental education; instant message; WhatsApp";PLATFORM;Introduction WhatsApp is an instant multimedia messaging and social media software which can be used for multiple purposes such as data, text, photographs and document transfer. Due to its versatility and multiple utilities, WhatsApp has been used within the educational setting in medicine and dentistry, proving a positive attitude of students towards its use. Aim To compare the reception time and the response time of WhatsApp with the traditional electronic email within the dental educational environment. Method A two-group comparative study was designed. Four multiple choice questions were sent via WhatsApp (group WA) and via electronic mail (group eM) to dental students. Data collected focused on the reception time and response time of students. Specifications of WhatsApp were used to collect data whilst an email tracker was used for the eM group. Excel software and Stata/IC version 15.1 software were used for data analysis. Results Seventy-four dental students from the University x (anonymised for reviewing purposes) dental school agreed to take part in this experience. However, 59 provided their responses (80%). Forty-four were females, and 15 were males. Twenty-seven participants were randomly allocated to the WA group and 32 to the eM group. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between groups: Reception time, P: .0286 value and response time, P: .0448 value indicating that the WA group was significantly faster in terms of reception and response time. Conclusion This pilot study suggests that WhatsApp is more efficient in terms of reception and response time than electronic emails.;"[Poblete, Paulina; Nieto, Eugenio] Univ Mayor, Escuela Odontol, Fac Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Poblete, Paulina] Univ Dundee, Sch Dent, Dundee, Scotland";;Poblete, P (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Odontol, Fac Ciencias, Santiago, Chile.;p.pobletepacheco@dundee.ac.uk;;;;;;9;5;6;1;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Aims: To create a modified version of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) adapted to the Chilean context and establish its psychometric properties. Methods: The content validity of DOPS was established through interviews and consensus survey. To be included in the new version, the respective domain should have been considered by over 80% of interviewers and it should have a Content Validity Index (CVI and kappa statistic over 0.78 and 0.6, respectively. For four months, the new DOPS was used to assess the intubation skills of the anesthesia trainees. Generalizability theory was used to establish reliability and internal consistency. Results: The interview suggested a DOPS with twelve domains. All were included in the final version as the CVI and kappa values were above 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. 585 procedures were assessed. The G coefficient was 0.90. The intubation needs to be assessed with DOPS at least six times to obtain a G coefficient of 0.80. Conclusions: The modified DOPS was a valid, reliable and practical tool for assessing the intubation procedure.

Exploring this debate, this article offers a case for the implementation of a more holistic and integral approach to mindfulness in educational settings. It will draw upon the philosophical legacy of Martin Heidegger and other critical theorists, who contest the dominant framing of neoliberalism and encourage engagement with more systemic perspectives. During this exploration, we examine two polemics: (1) whether mindfulness should be implemented technically or holistically and, (2) whether the focus should be individual and/or collective. The article concludes that although mindfulness may be an efficient 'self-technology' to improve certain aspects of individual well-being, it is necessary to challenge this perspective as it promotes a type of 'iatrogenic effect'. Specifically, it is argued that systemic failure is reframed as individual fallibility via a simplistic focus on well-being that may contradictorily foster appeasement to exploitative conditions. As an alternative, we offer a more integrative version, drawing in particular on the work of Ken Wilber, which proposes systemic as well as individual transformation.;"[Brito, Rodrigo; Joseph, Stephen; Sellman, Edward] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing CRHF, Sch Educ, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Brito, Rodrigo] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;"Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing CRHF, Sch Educ, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.; Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.";"rodrigobritopastrana@gmail.com; stephen.joseph@nottingham.ac.uk; edward.sellman@nottingham.ac.uk";;Sellman, Edward/0000-0001-9124-5502;;;;75;0;0;2;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0039-3746;1573-191X;;STUD PHILOS EDUC;Stud.

For some critics the process carries the risks of instrumentalizing knowledge and of leading the university to succumb under the demands of the market or the state; for other theorists it represents a concrete opportunity for the university to open up to the real needs of society and for reorienting theoretical and fragmented disciplines towards the resolution of concrete and challenging problems. This article pursues three objectives. Firstly, we show that the debate is usefully informed not only by ideas of what a university is, but also by ideas of a profession (and, by extension, of professional training). We suggest that both ideas help to overcome the conflict between the two afore-mentioned antagonist perspectives. Secondly, we demonstrate that a certain understanding of a profession can prevent the risk of viewing knowledge exclusively as scientific expertise and reducing training to the acquisition of technical skills. The position on professions adopted here is inspired by the Scottish philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, whose work is instructive in understanding professions as rational practical activities, embedded in a social context with their own internal goods. Our third objective, therefore, is to argue, with MacIntyre, that the presence of professions within the university opens up the opportunity to rescue forms of rationality that are oriented towards action and, by implication, promotes spaces of training that are resistant to exclusively corporate or governmental interests and criteria of mere effectiveness.";"[Serrano del Pozo, Ignacio] Univ Santo Tomas, Ctr Estudios Tomistas, Santiago, Chile; [Kreber, Carolin] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Educ Community & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland";;del Pozo, IS (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Ctr Estudios Tomistas, Santiago, Chile.;"iserrano@santotomas.cl; Carolin.Kreber@ed.ac.uk";;;;;;45;2;2;0;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0039-3746;1573-191X;;STUD PHILOS EDUC;Stud.

Vietnamese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL; n = 74) performed a communicative task in dyads in 15 minutes. Their positive emotional engagement was gauged using an Experience Sampling Method via a questionnaire that the participants completed after every five-minute interval of the interaction, capturing three timepoints of learners' emotional engagement. Learners' cognitive and social interactional behaviours were examined in light of the amount of second language production (words and turns), language-related episodes (LREs), and the degree of collaboration. Results showed that learners' positive emotional engagement fluctuated over the course of a 15-minute interaction. Also, learners' levels of positive emotional engagement were positively correlated with the amount of second language production and the degree of collaboration, but these relationships varied across the three intervals. No relationship was observed between learners' emotional engagement and LREs. The results indicate that although learners' positive emotional engagement may not be linked with their attention to form, relationships exist between learners' positive emotional engagement and their language production, as well as their social relationships. These relationships can be, however, subject to change over the course of a short interaction.";"[Dao, Phung] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Arts & Humanities Bldg,Cavendish St, Manchester M15 6BG, Lancs, England; [Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile";;Dao, P (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Arts & Humanities Bldg,Cavendish St, Manchester M15 6BG, Lancs, England.;p.dao@mmu.ac.uk;DAO, PHUNG/U-6887-2019;"DAO, PHUNG/0000-0002-8612-5589; Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406";"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CIE160009]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533), as well as the PIA (CIE160009) received from the CONICYT, awarded to the second author.;;96;2;2;26;28;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1362-1688;1477-0954;;LANG TEACH RES;Lang.

However, definitions of context vary widely and the direct impact of the context is often unexplained. Based on research showing contextual differences in second language (L2) learner beliefs and interactional behaviors, the current project compared those factors in two distinct contexts: Chilean English as a foreign language (EFL) (n = 19) and Australian English as a second language (ESL) (n = 27) contexts. In this project, the learners completed a set of group discussion activities as part of their regular class work. They then completed a questionnaire pertaining to L2 motivation, perceptions of group work, and first language (L1) use. The group interaction data were analysed for: (1) the frequency of language-related episodes (LREs); (2) the initiator of LREs (self or other); and (3) L1 use for resolving LREs. The results showed that the EFL learners produced significantly more LREs. The EFL learners also used more L1 to resolve LREs. Factor analyses of the questionnaire data, conducted within- and across-contexts, showed notable differences in the two contexts as well. However, the findings of learner beliefs did not necessarily account for the differential classroom behaviors. We discuss our findings by reference to the socio-linguistic and socio-educational statuses of English in the two contexts as well as approaches to instruction which together shaped the learners' differential needs and purposes for learning the L2.";"[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Storch, Neomy] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.;masatoshi.sato@unab.cl;Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533]; Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [CIE160009]; Dyason Fellowship by the University of Melbourne [00065961]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT), awarded to the first author, and Dyason Fellowship by the University of Melbourne (Grant/Award Number: 00065961), awarded to the second author.;;85;14;14;7;33;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1362-1688;1477-0954;;LANG TEACH RES;Lang.

University-level EFL learners in a teacher training program (N = 102) watched a video in which two L2 speakers carried out a job interview role-play. The interview was scripted so that the job applicant produced 15 errors: five morphosyntactic, five lexical, and five phonological. While watching the video, the pre-service teachers completed a form to give feedback to the job applicant about four dimensions of her performance: appearance and behavior, interest and enthusiasm, content of responses, and language use. They also completed a doze proficiency test, the MLAT analytical ability test, and an interaction mindset questionnaire. Results showed that the learners reported few of the errors that had been scripted into the role-play. A regression model indicated that two subconstructs of interaction mindset (form-orientation and provision of peer feedback) predicted the number of linguistic errors reported. The findings and pedagogical implications are discussed in light of the relevance of interaction mindset to L2 learners' attention to form during task-based interaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A quantitative methodology, with a representative sample of 568 students (N=273 from Chile and N=295 from Uruguay) was designed and implemented. TDC was also studied and discussed in relation to gender and educational level. Results showed a mostly basic level for the four dimensions of the TDC in the sample. Regarding the relationship between the variables and the TDC, the Planning, organization and management of spaces and technological resources' dimension is the only one showing significant differences. In particular, male students achieved a higher TDC level compared with female students. Furthermore, the proportion of Primary Education students with a low TDC level was significantly higher than other students. In conclusion, it is necessary, for teacher training institutions in Chile and Uruguay, to implement policies at different moments and in different areas of the ITT process in order to improve the development of the TDC.;"[Silva, Juan] Univ Santiago, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Silva, Juan] Univ Santiago, Ctr Invest & Innovac Educ & TIC, Santiago, Chile; [Usart, Mireia] Univ Rovira & Virgili Tarragona, Dept Pedag, Tarragona, Spain; [Lazaro-Cantabrana, Jose-Luis] Univ Rovira & Virgili Tarragona, Fac Ciencias Educ & Psicol, Comis Serv, Tarragona, Spain";;"Silva, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Silva, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago, Ctr Invest & Innovac Educ & TIC, Santiago, Chile.";"juan.silva@usach.cl; mireia.usart@urv.cat; joseluis.lazaro@urv.cat";Usart, Mireia/N-5982-2018;"Usart, Mireia/0000-0003-4372-9312; Lazaro-Cantabrana, Jose L./0000-0001-9689-603X; Silva Quiroz, Juan Eusebio/0000-0002-9817-402X";;;;40;15;15;2;13;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;OCT 1;2019;27;61;;;;;33;43;;10.3916/C61-2019-03;;;11;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";JZ0BA;WOS:000504768000003;;gold, Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published;;;2022-04-06;

These policies, initiated under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, did not change with the new democratic governments after 1990. This characteristic led international organizations to promote the Chilean policies in different contexts in Latin America and beyond. In 2006, a high school student movement occupied public and private schools, demystifying the outcomes of these policies. A new wave of demonstrations took place in 2011, with a college student leadership that paralyzed a significant amount of universities and schools throughout the country. After both waves of mobilizations, the political system opened the process of policy-making that considered the demands of social movements. In this article, we explore the dynamics between educational policies and social student movements in Chile, and the possibilities of change in favor of public education.;"[Inzunza, Jorge] Delavan Darien Sch, Turtle Creek Elementary Sch, Delavan, WI USA; [Assael, Jenny; Cornejo, Rodrigo; Redondo, Jesus] Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Inzunza, J (corresponding author), Delavan Darien Sch Dist, 125 S Walworth St, Darien, WI 53114 USA.;jinzunzah@gmail.com;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; redondo rojo, jesus maria/M-9231-2018";"redondo rojo, jesus maria/0000-0002-5562-2590; Inzunza, Jorge/0000-0001-5231-6996; Cornejo Chavez, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6713-0166";"PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; FONDECYT (Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180801]";"Support from PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003; FONDECYT (Chile) No 1160445 and; FONDECYT (Chile) No 1180801.";;60;8;9;0;26;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-5692;1465-3346;;BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC;Br.

Methods An online survey was carried out during the period July-December 2013. Forty-one representatives of early career psychiatrists of their national associations were invited to participate. Each respondent was asked to provide the collective feedback of the association rather than that of any of its individual officer or member. Results Thirty-two associations returned the questionnaire out of the 41 contacted (response rate, 78 %). All respondents recognized psychopathology as a core component of training in psychiatry. According to respondents, the primary aims of psychopathology are (a) to assess psychiatric symptoms (47 %), (b) to understand patients' abnormal experiences (33 %), and (c) to make nosographical diagnosis (20 %). A formal training course in psychopathology is available in 29 out of the 32 surveyed countries. In most countries, (a) there is not a defined number of hours dedicated to psychopathology, (b) teaching is mainly theoretical, and (c) a structured training on psychometric tools is missing. At the end of the training, about half of trainees is not satisfied with received training in psychopathology. Conclusions According to European early career psychiatrists, there is the need to rethink training in psychopathology, which should be at the heart of training in psychiatry and the key element of psychiatric practice. Education in psychopathology is affected by several unmet needs, such as lack of appropriate training in the use of psychometric instruments, lack of supervision, and lack of practical skills.;"[Fiorillo, Andrea; Sampogna, Gaia; Del Vecchio, Valeria; Luciano, Mario] Univ Naples SUN, Naples, Italy; [Ambrosini, Alessandra] Univ G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy; [Stanghellini, Giovanni] D Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Fiorillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples SUN, Naples, Italy.;anfioril@tin.it;stanghellini, giovanni/G-6009-2014;Luciano, Mario/0000-0002-4338-1371;;;;45;5;5;0;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-9670;1545-7230;;ACAD PSYCHIATR;Acad.

The course design was based on the dialogic technique and was aimed at clarifying the students' own values, defining their own positions related to ethical dilemmas, developing argumentative strategies and an ethical commitment to their profession and contribution to society. The online dialogue between heterogeneous groups of students based on their cultural background -the main innovation of this training- was possible thanks to the technological and administrative support of the participating universities. To analyze the effect of this innovative training we employed a quasi-experimental design using a control group, i.e., without the option of online dialogue with students from another culture. University students from Spain (University of Cantabria) and Chile (Universidad Autonoma de Chile) participated in this study. The positive results, which included better scores and positive assessments of both debate involvement and inter-cultural contact by students who participated in the new teaching program, support the main conclusion that the opening of international dialogue on moral dilemmas through new communication technologies contributes significantly to improve ethics training in higher education.;"[Briones, Elena] Univ Cantabria, Evolut & Educ Psychol, Santander, Spain; [Lara, Laura] Univ Autonoma Chile, Santiago, Chile";;"Briones, E (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Evolut & Educ Psychol, Santander, Spain.; Lara, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chile, Santiago, Chile.";"brionese@unican.es; llarav@uautonoma.cl";"Lara, Laura/E-3709-2018; Briones, Elena/C-8422-2018";"Lara, Laura/0000-0001-6420-2398; Briones, Elena/0000-0003-4521-4582";University of Cantabria;This work was performed under the framework of a Teaching Innovation Project which was funded by the University of Cantabria (school year 2014-15).;;35;12;15;3;39;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;APR 1;2016;24;47;;;;;99;107;;10.3916/C47-2016-10;;;9;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";DI4QP;WOS:000373484700010;;gold, Green Submitted, Green Published;;;2022-04-06;

However, evidence about which of a school's attributes really drives parental choice is still scarce. We use census data from a parent questionnaire in Chile, a country with a national school choice and competition system, to describe the attributes most commonly considered by parents when choosing a school, and to assess how the probability of prioritizing those attributes varies with the parents socioeconomic characteristics, while controlling for other characteristics of the family. We find that parents choosing a school prioritize its proximity, its quality, and whether it provides religious education. Furthermore, the probability of parents prioritizing proximity is higher for parents of low socioeconomic status, while the probability of them prioritizing quality and religious education is higher for parents of high socioeconomic status. These findings show that only advantaged families choose schools based on their quality, and therefore school choice and competition policies may offer a limited benefit for disadvantaged pupils, possibly maintaining or reinforcing socioeconomic segregation in the education system.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Gelber, Denisse] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Tellez Canas, Santiago] Univ Externado Colombia, Bogota, Colombia";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile.;"alvaro.hofflinger@ufrontera.cl; dgelber@uc.cl; santiago.tellez@uexternado.edu.co";;Gelber, Denisse/0000-0001-6073-5808;National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007, REDI 170019];We are grateful for the funds provided by the National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007 and REDI 170019], which contributed to this research.;;61;5;5;5;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

The school competition theory holds that achievement rises when students can choose among competing schools. The school resources theory holds that achievement rises with schools' resources per student. The family resources theory holds that achievement rises as parents become more educated and earn higher incomes. We test all three theories in Chile between 2002 and 2013, when reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, as school competition, school resources, and family resources all increased. We compare Chilean municipalities in a difference-in-differences analysis, asking whether test scores rose fastest in municipalities with greater increases in school competition, school resources, or family resources. We find that municipal test scores did not rise with school competition but did rise with family resources (parental education, not income) and, to a smaller extent, with school resources (as measured by class sizes). Results favor the family resource theory, and to a lesser extent the school resource theory, but not the school competition theory.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Publ Policy Sociol Stat & Data Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA";;von Hippel, PT (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com;;;;;;61;3;3;0;12;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0038-0407;1939-8573;;SOCIOL EDUC;Sociol.

In this paper, we compared the bonuses schools actually received on the basis of this formula to how they would have fared under a hypothetical alternative measure of school performance-intra-cohort gains between the 4th and 8th grades in 1996-2000. We show that schools that received monetary premiums for good performance under the SNED program were more likely to be schools that had scored higher on the 4th grade 1996 test, but, on average, they were not the schools that made the highest cohort gains as students progressed from 4th grade in 1996 to 8th grade in 2000. Given what we have found, to get more SNED awards, the wise school would do much better to raise 4th grade and 8th grade scores every two years (even years for 4th grade and odd years for 8th grade) and not focus on the more difficult task of helping students make greater progress from 4th to 8th grades. Although we have data on only one cohort's gain scores from 4th to 8th grades, our limited analysis demonstrates the possible constraints of a school-based incentive program when the available student performance data for awarding pay bonuses are inter-cohort rather than intracohort test score gains.;"[Carnoy, Martin; Brodziak, Iliana] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Molina, Andres] Minist Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Socias, Miguel] Amer Inst Res, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA";;Carnoy, M (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;carnoy@stanford.edu;;;;;;28;7;7;0;9;MIT PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA;1557-3060;1557-3079;;EDUC FINANC POLICY;Educ.

Linking our survey records to administrative education and earnings data, we compare earnings and cost expectations to observed values for past students and follow survey participants forward to see how beliefs relate to matriculation and dropout outcomes. We find that students have correctly centered but noisy cost expectations, and appear to systematically overestimate earnings outcomes for past graduates. Students who overestimate costs are less likely to matriculate in any degree program and in their stated first-choice program, and are more likely to drop out. Students who overestimate earnings matriculate at similar rates to other students, but choose degree programs where past students have been less likely to graduate, have earned less early in their careers, and have been more likely to default on student loans. Consistent with an informal model of enrollment choice, students with a stated preference for labor market-related degree characteristics are less likely to overestimate earnings outcomes and choose degrees where past students have gone on to earn more, while the opposite is true for students with a stated preference for enjoyment of the curriculum.

Despite the common goal of discovering second language (L2) learning processes and products, the two inquiries have taken distinct paths. We argue that it is necessary to unite the knowledge and methods in the two inquiries, in order to answer theoretical and practical questions pertaining to classroom L2 teaching and learning. We make the case that the L2 classroom may be an ideal venue to explore the intersections of the two fields. Three intersections will be discussed. First, research can address the relationship between LP and interactional behaviors during classroom activities that have been investigated in ISLA research. Second, the roles of teachers, the classroom environment, and instruction - the primary variables in ISLA research - can be examined in relation to LP in the classroom. Third, research can target LP as a dependent variable in experimental designs that ISLA research often employs. LP is a primary concern of L2 teachers who face a range of LP (unmotivated students, silent students, anxious students, etc.). Some teachers are also concerned about the potential negative impact of a certain instructional technique on LP. Thus, combining LP and ISLA perspectives helps answer various pedagogical concerns, whether these are related to particular LP issues, or the impact of instructional techniques on LP. Throughout the article, we propose future research topics and make pedagogical recommendations addressing LP in the classroom.;"[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Csizer, Kata] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary";;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.;masatoshi.sato@unab.cl;;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533]; PIA from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [CIE160009];  [NKFIH-129149]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT), awarded to the first author, and NKFIH-129149 awarded to the second author.;;103;1;1;14;14;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1362-1688;1477-0954;;LANG TEACH RES;Lang.

To highlight issues of identity in such exchanges, we present case studies of discussions in two online chat groups led by graduate students with contrasting linguistic and cultural backgrounds. In our discourse analysis of the chat transcripts from these two groups, we found differences in how participants oriented to local, national, and global contexts, with one group primarily discussing political and educational issues from a global perspective, while the second group responded to the same issues by giving local examples. We conclude by discussing pedagogical implications for future Internet exchanges that aim to foster intercultural learning within a transnational paradigm of foreign language education.;"[Menard-Warwick, Julia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Linguist, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Heredia-Herrera, Ana] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Dept Idiomas Extranjeros, Arica, Chile";;Menard-Warwick, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Linguist, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;"jemwarwick@ucdavis.edu; soares.dionne@gmail.com; aheredia@uta.cl";;;;;;43;17;17;0;28;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0026-7902;1540-4781;;MOD LANG J;Mod.

To deal with selection bias, we use propensity score matching to compare the test scores of reduced-fee paying, low-income students in fee-charging private voucher schools to those of similar students in public schools and free private voucher schools. Our results reveal that students in fee-charging private voucher schools score slightly higher than students in public schools. The difference in standardized test scores is approximately 10 points, a test score gain of 0.2 standard deviations. We find no difference in the academic achievement of students in the fee-charging private voucher treatment group relative to their Counterparts in free private voucher schools.

A nonexperimental quantitative research design was utilised in this study because two psychological scales have been applied, considering a random cluster sample, which is understood as a probability sampling because the number of participants has representativeness in the Spanish primary education system. Results demonstrate that music teachers work alone at schools, such that they have limited chances for interacting with other music educators at the workplace. In conclusion, job isolation is the turning point for understanding the motivational status of music teachers, at least in Spain.

We believe these perspectives will be useful for others who are developing critical thinking skills curricula, especially first year courses. Aspects of the course design which were considered particularly effective were the use of scaffolded assessment, the application of threshold concepts, and well-structured collaborative learning activities paired with quality tutors. The key learning for the authors from the evaluation of the course was that while the tools and strategies developed were very useful, interweaving these tools into year 2 and 3 courses would help students see the ongoing value of critical thinking in their work.;"[Whiley, Dona; Witt, Bradd; Colvin, R.

The aim of the present research is to investigate about primary-age children's habits with these tools, as well as these children's perception of parental mediation in this area. In this study we used an ex post facto descriptive methodology by survey. A questionnaire was applied for data recollection to 422 children of private schools in Santiago de Chile aged between 9 and 12 years old. The results point to an early access to electronic devices and the transversal and homogeneous use during childhood. There is no doubt that ICTs play an active role in daily life for most of these children. No significant differences in age or sex were detected in our study, but we encountered risky behaviours in how children use ICTs and in their perception of parental mediation. The complexity becomes more evident the more time they have with electronic devices connected to the Internet without adult supervision. This finding raises the need for the application of intervention programs on parental mediation of children's use of ICTs in order to promote a safe, responsible and ethical use of these tools.;"[Berrios, Llarela; Garces, Maria-Soledad] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile; [Buxarrais, Maria-Rosa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Theory & Hist Educ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain";;Berrios, L (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile.;"llarela.berrios@uandes.cl; mrbuxarrais@ub.edu; sgarces@uandes.cl";;"Buxarrais, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-7511-3814; Berrios, Llarela/0000-0002-0716-8610";;;;27;16;17;0;30;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JUL 1;2015;23;45;;;;;161;168;;10.3916/C45-2015-17;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";DB5DR;WOS:000368534800017;;gold, Green Published, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

The participants graduated from three universities in Chile, one public and two private selected as representing three levels of university selectivity. The sample was constructed by random selection among five cohorts of graduates, from 2012 to 2016. A self-report questionnaire was administered on two occasions, in 2015 for the first three cohorts and in 2017 for the last two. The obtained sample included 587 graduates, in Psychology and in Teaching of Basic Education. The results reveal that selectivity is related to graduates' satisfaction with their university experience; the more selective the university in which they are admitted, the more graduates are satisfied. Salary, on the other hand, is related to satisfaction only in the case of the least selective university.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven high school teachers and five deaf education teachers, to explore their practices and beliefs regarding teaching D/HH students in regular classrooms. Ten classroom observations were also carried out in classes with and without the presence of a deaf education teacher. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Class observations enabled a better understanding of the context in which D/HH students and their teachers interact daily. Results from interview analysis provided information of teachers' beliefs about D/HH students; regular teachers and deaf education teachers' perceptions of the roles they play in students' learning; accommodations made for D/HH students; and facilitators and barriers for teaching in classes with D/HH students. High school teachers' report of their difficulties to teach D/HH students and their need to rely on deaf education teachers in the classroom was corroborated by classroom observations, which showed that most D/HH students were unable to follow the class in absence of special teacher's support, and regular teachers had problems communicating with them. D/HH students' opportunities for learning are highly restricted in such environment.

We conducted a topographical review of 48 articles from Latin America published in eight core EDLM journals published between 1991 and 2017. Data analysis focused on analyzing identified modal trends as well as highlighting variability in patterns of knowledge production. Notably, 75% of the studies had been published in the past 10 years, and 56% in the past five years. Geographic coverage was highly uneven across Latin America. While there were 19 articles from Chile, numerous Latin American societies were unrepresented in the database. Almost 80% of the corpus consisted of empirical studies and topical foci were highly diverse. Comparison of these results with findings reported in recent reviews of EDLM research from other developing societies yielded recommendations for enhancing research capacity and output in Latin America. A key limitation of the review was its exclusion of local language sources. This led to the further recommendation for Latin American scholars to undertake broader multi-language reviews of the EDLM knowledge base in Latin America.;"[Aravena Castillo, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Hallinger, Philip] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, Ctr Res Sustainable Leadership, Leadership, Bangkok, Thailand; [Hallinger, Philip] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Educ Leadership & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa";;Hallinger, P (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 Vipawadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.;hallinger@gmail.com;Hallinger, Philip/H-6071-2013;Hallinger, Philip/0000-0002-5935-7544;;;;74;39;44;5;13;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

However, the number of actual LA implementations at scale remains limited, notwithstanding considerable effort made to formulate guidelines and frameworks to support the LA policy development. Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated. It is hoped that this study will provide additional guidance for future Latin-American and other LA initiatives.;"[Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LESEC, Leuven, Belgium; [Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Augment HCI Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Engn Sch, Assessment & Evaluat, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Nyi-Nyi Htun] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200A,Box 2402, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Millecamp, Martijn] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Human Comp Interact Grp, Augment, Leuven, Belgium; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola; Solano-Quinde, Lizandro; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena; Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel] Univ Cuenca, Fac Engn, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola; Solano-Quinde, Lizandro; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena; Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Verbert, Katrien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, HCI Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [De Laet, Tinne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Engn Sci, Leuven, Belgium";;Broos, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200A,Box 2402, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.;tom.broos@kuleuven.be;"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Broos, Tom/F-5424-2017; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"verbert, katrien/0000-0001-6699-7710; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena/0000-0003-1367-5288; Broos, Tom/0000-0002-4139-2608; Htun, Nyi Nyi/0000-0001-9604-4056; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; De Laet, Tinne/0000-0003-0624-3305";Erasmus + Programme of the European Union [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP];This work was supported by the Erasmus + Programme of the European Union [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP].;;21;3;3;0;8;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

The results indicated that didactic training alone was not associated with changes in teacher behaviors.

Yet we know little about the politics of improving education. One significant and instructive case of reforms designed to boost education quality comes from Chile, where in 2016 the government enacted a sweeping reform of teaching careers. This paper first uses a quantitative analysis of appearances in the news to identify key stakeholders and then turns to process tracing to analyze how and when these stakeholders influenced reform dynamics. Comparatively, the Chilean case differs from similar reforms elsewhere in Latin America due to the absence of business, the strong role of policy networks, and the final negotiated settlement with the teacher union. Theoretically, the analysis confirms general theories that emphasize the roles of distributive politics and policy networks.;"[Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Schneider, Ben] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schneider, Ben] Stellenbosch Univ, Stellenbosch Inst Adv Study STIAS, Wallenberg Res Ctr, Stellenbosch, South Africa";;Schneider, B (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;brs@mit.edu;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013";"Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Schneider, Ben/0000-0001-9227-7805";;;;59;6;6;3;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

A Hong Kong case study;EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Chinese principals; democratic leadership practice; inclusion for social justice; leadership problems; multicultural contexts; uncontrollable forces";"SOCIAL-JUSTICE; CHALLENGES; EDUCATION";Research on principals' practice of democratic leadership for inclusion in schools has been undertaken in many parts of the world. This paper explores four principals' leadership journeys in response to social justice issues in increasingly diverse settings within public schools, in relation to demographic and cultural changes in Hong Kong. This research aims at exploring the issues in schools arising from contextual changes in the society, contextualising characteristics of principals' practices in relation to an emergent conception of democratic leadership practice in addressing the issues and identifying practical roles of democratic principal leadership in school transformation for diverse students' learning development. I adopted a cross-case study of the principals' leadership journeys through a theoretical lens of democratic leadership. The changes of demographic structure and cultural context and pressure from the central administration were the conditions of facilitating alternative practices of democratic principal leadership in a multicultural school context which evolved from the hybrid of Western and Confucian cultures in the city. These findings contribute to an international account of contextualising democratic leadership practices in a diverse Chinese school community.;"[Szeto, Elson] Ctr Special Educ Needs & Inclus Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Elson] Dept Educ Policy & Leadership, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Elson] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Szeto, E (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;eszeto@eduhk.hk;;Szeto, Elson/0000-0002-8616-1221;;;;59;1;1;2;12;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

The Portuguese prison system, similar to other prison systems (e.g. England), offers prison-based educational programmes so inmates can complete compulsory education. However, the completion rate of these educational programmes is low, and the dropout rate is high. Deepening our understanding of how inmates conceptualise learning and how they engage in learning will improve the quality of the prison-based educational services and promote school enrolment. Data from a phenomenographic study of 30 Portuguese inmate students, ranging from 20 to 58years of age, revealed an understanding of learning focused on the instrumental role of knowledge and its application in the short-term (e.g. learning how to read) and on integration in the prison system (e.g. learning how to play draughts to fit in the yard). Moreover, a broader understanding of learning that reflected particular forms of learning favoured within the prison context also emerged in the discourse. Forexample, learning was described as an opportunity to reflect upon their previous offence and behaviours and on the need to avoid violence. Participants also stressed the importance of setting an academic example for their children by engaging actively in learning and the significance of occupying one's time in prison in a positive and beneficial manner. Findings allow a first approach to prison students' involvement in school learning by listening to the inmates' opinions and thoughts, and they offer promising suggestions to improve the organisation of prison-based educational programmes.;"[Rosario, Pedro; Pereira, Joana; Cunha, Jennifer] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunez, Jose] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gaeta, Martha] Univ Popular Autonoma Estado Puebla, Santiago, Spain; [Polydoro, Soely] Univ Estadual Campinas, BR-13081970 Campinas, SP, Brazil";;Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Escola Psicol, Campus Gualtar, P-4710 Braga, Portugal.;prosario@psi.uminho.pt;"Cunha, Jennifer/AAZ-7844-2020; Núñez, José Carlos/H-4425-2013; Núñez, José Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Gaeta, Martha/AAN-4052-2021; Rosário, Pedro/A-1775-2011";"Cunha, Jennifer/0000-0001-8604-2049; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Rosário, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Polydoro, Soely/0000-0003-4823-3228";;;;64;3;3;0;32;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0141-1926;1469-3518;;BRIT EDUC RES J;Br.

According to existing literature, self-regulated learning (SRL) research in MOOCs is still scarce. More studies which build on past works regarding SRL in MOOCs are required, as well as literature reviews that help to identify the main challenges and future research directions in relation to this area. In this paper, the authors present the results of a systematic literature review on SRL in MOOCs, covering all the related papers published until the end of 2017. The papers considered in this review include real experiences with at least a MOOC (other learning scenarios sometimes claimed as MOOCs, such as blended courses, or online courses with access restrictions, are out of the scope of this analysis). Most studies on SRL in MOOCs share some common features: they are generally exploratory, based on one single MOOC and tend not to specify in which SRL model they are grounded. The results reveal that high self-regulators engage in non-linear navigation and approach MOOCs as an informal learning opportunity. In general, they prefer setting specific goals based on knowledge development and control their learning through assignments.;"[Elena Alonso-Mencia, M.; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Estevez-Ayres, Iria; Delgado Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Avda Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, IRIT, Toulouse, France";;Alario-Hoyos, C (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Avda Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.;calario@it.uc3m.es;"Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011";"Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/0000-0002-1047-5398; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X";"CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL [21160081]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, 574212-EPP -1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Madrid Regional Government [S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]";"This work was supported by the CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL 2016 [Grant Number 21160081]; European Commission [Grant Numbers 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP and 574212-EPP -1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [Grant Number 11150231]; Madrid Regional Government [Grant Number S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Grant Number TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R].";;79;13;13;12;93;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0013-1911;1465-3397;;EDUC REV;Educ.

One pedagogical activity used to promote global competencies is the participation of students in multinational design projects. This is a problem-based learning approach in an international setting, where students get immersed in the solution of an engineering design task while they work in teams and collaborate with international partners. The main goal of these projects is to foster international collaboration and to offer an opportunity to the students to develop professional skills through international teamwork effort in the solution of a design problem. However, a real challenge of this practice has been to create an effective interaction among the students participating in this type of projects and to maintain the flow of information, and student engagement in the project and in their learning. The main objective of this work is to investigate the sociotechnical interaction of engineering students working in a multinational collaborative project and the role of information technology tools and the nature of the interaction in this experience. For this purpose an assessment tool was developed and used to determine the interaction among the students (frequency, quantity and quality), the value of social interaction in the flow of the interaction, and the impact of the interaction in the development of the project. The main findings of this instrument are presented in this work.;"[Esparragoza, I. E.] Penn State Univ, Sch Engn Design Technol & Profess Programs, Media, PA 19063 USA; [Farak, S.

In the past few years, strategies have been generated to optimize the use of technological resources with the aim of facilitating widespread adoption of technology in the classroom. Given its low acquisition and maintenance costs, the interpersonal computer allows individual interaction and simultaneous learning with large groups of students. The purpose of this work was to compare arithmetical knowledge acquired by third-grade students through the use of game-based activities and non-game-based activities using an interpersonal computer, with knowledge acquired through the use of traditional paper-and-pencil activities, and to analyze their impact in various socio-cultural contexts. To do this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 271 students in three different countries (Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica), in both rural and urban schools. A set of educational games for practising arithmetic was developed and tested in six schools within these three countries. Results show that there were no significant differences (ANCOVA) in the learning acquired from game-based vs. non-game-based activities. However, both showed a significant difference when compared with the traditional method. Additionally, both groups using the interpersonal computer showed higher levels of student interest than the traditional method group, and these technological methods were seen to be especially effective in increasing learning among weaker students.;"[Beserra, Vagner; Nussbaum, Miguel; Wurman, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Zeni, Ricardo] Univ Estadual Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rodriguez, Werner] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica";;Beserra, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;"vagner.beserra@gmail.com; mn@ing.puc.cl; jrzeni@feg.unesp.br; werner.rodriguez@ucr.ac.cr; gabow4@gmail.com";"Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020; Beserra, Vagner/C-4890-2015; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";"Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983";;;;32;11;11;1;18;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNKIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Teaching modules were designed based on the secondary physics curricula in Finland (Helsinki) and Chile (Santiago and Vina del Mar) emphasising students engagement in scientific practices. The study was implemented in four classrooms in both countries. Data on situational interest and ongoing classroom activities were obtained using the experience sampling method, with measurements taken three times during a lesson. The process yielded a total of 1717 measurements in the Finnish schools and 1767 in the Chilean schools. Multilevel regression analyses with mixed effects and random intercept were conducted. Results showed a positive effect of scientific practices that required asking questions, designing scientific inquiry and interpreting data on situational interest. Student collaborative situations were more interesting for Chilean students than for Finnish ones. In terms of gender differences, on average, Finnish male and female students experienced the same level of situational interest, while the situational interest of Chilean female students was higher than the average of male students. Personal interest in science studies and careers was the best predictor of situational interest in both countries.;"[Lavonen, Jari; Upadyaya, Katja; Juuti, Kalle; Inkinen, Janna; Salmela-Aro, Katariina] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Lavonen, Jari] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Childhood Educ, Soweto, South Africa; [Avalos, Beatrice; Araneda, Sebastian] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Cumsille, Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Lavonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland.;jari.lavonen@helsinki.fi;;"salmela-aro, katariina/0000-0003-1901-4712; Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953; Upadyaya, Katja/0000-0002-4793-1799; Araneda, Sebastian/0000-0002-2845-0340; Juuti, Kalle/0000-0001-8696-2611; Inkinen, Sini Janna Maria/0000-0003-2856-4601; Cumsille, Patricio/0000-0002-3911-2910";"Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [294228, 298323]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";This work was supported by the Academy of Finland (#294228 and #298323) and by the ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and Joint Research Projects CONICYT-AKAEDU 2015.;;75;0;0;9;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

Beyond the Workplace: Large Groups, Activity and the Shared Object;MIND CULTURE AND ACTIVITY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Organisation Workshop stands for a body of practice derived from the pioneering work that Clodomir de Morais did with the Brasilian Peasant Leagues starting in the early 1960s and shown to be relevant today in situations of high unemployment. Two essential ingredients are a large group and a common resource pool. The Organisation Workshop method is illuminated by Leontiev's objectivised activity concept, as well as important insights from 3 generations of activity theory (CHAT). Moraisean thought and practice are shown to open up new avenues to community development and to break new ground in the social psychology of the large group.;"[Andersson, Gavin; Labra, Ivan] Seriti Inst, Sandton, South Africa; [Carmen, Raff] Univ Manchester UoM, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Richards, Howard] Univ Santiago Chile FAE USACH, Santiago, Chile";;Carmen, R (corresponding author), 79 Old Hall Lane, Manchester M13 0UJ, Lancs, England.;rafaelcarmen2@gmail.com;;;;;;59;0;0;0;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1074-9039;1532-7884;;MIND CULT ACT;Mind Cult.

To that end, we use data from PISA, TERCE, and TIMSS, as they operationalize socio-economic status somewhat differently. As part of our analysis, we examine whether TERCE, a Latin American study - with measures that are regionally developed - exhibits better psychometric properties than measures that are designed to function across a larger and more diverse number of educational systems. We also examine TIMSS, a trends focused study - that has historically emphasized consistency and comparison. Finally, we include PISA which has the largest number of participants and has changed and conceptualized a great deal of its background questionnaire depending on the study's major domain and focus. Our findings suggest that none of the socioeconomic background scales we analyzed are fully invariant in any of the three studies, and therefore comparisons across countries should be done with caution. The different levels of equivalence reached by each scale in each study and the type of comparisons that can be made given these results (e.g., comparison of average scale scores, comparison of relationships between the tested scales and other variables) are discussed in the full paper.;"[Sandoval-Hernandez, Andres] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Rutkowski, David] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Rutkowski, David; Matta, Tyler] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Matta, Tyler] Pearson, London, England; [Miranda, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Miranda, Daniel] Ctr Estudios Conflicto & Cohes Social, Santiago, Chile";;Sandoval-Hernandez, A (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Educ, Claverton Down, Bath BA1 6TP, Avon, England.;A.Sandoval@bath.ac.uk;Sandoval-Hernandez, Andres/X-8846-2019;Sandoval-Hernandez, Andres/0000-0002-4106-062X;;;;41;6;6;2;3;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

The results revealed the meanings of the antiderivative that are more predominantly used by civil engineering students.

The results show that Chinese students and male students were generally in a more unfavorable situation in terms of their approaches to studying and course experiences than their Chilean and female counterparts, and that students who were pursuing majors in science and engineering performed worse than students who were pursuing majors in the humanities and social sciences. Although the results regarding the relationship between approaches to studying and course experiences were largely consistent with previous findings, we highlight the different roles of good teaching and appropriate workload in the two samples.

They are often distinguished by hybrid learning environments that encompass elements of formal and informal learning, in activities that happen in distributed settings (indoors and outdoors), across physical and virtual spaces. Despite their purported benefits, these environments imply additional complexity in the design, monitoring and evaluation of learning activities. The research literature on learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) has started to deal with these issues. This paper presents a systematic literature review of LD and LA, in m/u-learning. Apart from providing an overview of the current research in the field, this review elicits elements of common ground between both communities, as shown by the similar learning contexts and complementary research contributions, and based on the research gaps, proposes to: address m/u-learning beyond higher education settings, reinforce the connection between physical and virtual learning spaces, and more systematically align LD and LA processes.;"[Pishtari, Gerti; Rodriguez-Triana, Maria J.] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Sarmiento-Marquez, Edna M.; Prieto, Luis P.; Valjataga, Terje] Tallinn Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Tallinn, Estonia; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ruiz-Calleja, Adolfo; Serrano-Iglesias, Sergio] Valladolid Univ, GSIC, Valladolid, Spain; [Santos, Patricia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Informat & Commun Technol Dept, Barcelona, Spain";;Pishtari, G (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ, Narva Maantee 25, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.;"gerti.pishtari@tlu.ee; lprisan@tlu.ee; sergio@gsic.uva.es";"Prieto, Luis P./K-4236-2015; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014; Rodriguez Triana, Maria Jesus/A-6019-2015";"Prieto, Luis P./0000-0002-0057-0682; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; Rodriguez Triana, Maria Jesus/0000-0001-8639-1257; Valjataga, Terje/0000-0001-8109-0674";"EUEuropean Commission [669074, 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Spanish projectsSpanish Government [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-3-R, VA257P18]";This research was partially funded by EU grants 669074, 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, and Spanish projects TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-3-R, VA257P18.;;76;12;12;9;61;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Training programs for present or future school leaders have proliferated in the region, often publicly financed, but without enough evidence of their impact. Using data for seven Latin American countries from the Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE), we seek to determine the association between school leaders' formal education and training received, with well recognized dimensions of school leadership practices reported by their teachers. We estimated linear regression models for each country in Latin America to determine the relationship between principals' preparation with indicators of educational leadership practices. Our results show that in most observed indicators of leadership practices the effect of education or training is marginal. We provide possible explanations for this finding, emphasizing the weaknesses in principals' initial selection processes and their deficiencies. We also consider schools' precarious conditions to support principals in order to put the knowledge they learned in training activities into practice. We point out the need to continue conducting specific studies on the effects of training on educational leadership among school leaders in the region, overcoming TERCE information restrictions.;"[Weinstein, Jose] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Weinstein, Jose] CEDLE Chile, Ctr Dev Educ Leadership, Santiago, Spain; [Azar, Ariel] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Flessa, Joseph] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Educ Leadership & Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada";;Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Santiago Ctr, Vergara 249,Tercer Piso, Santiago, Chile.;jose.weinstein@gmail.com;;;;;;62;5;5;1;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

Nevertheless, the nature of this phenomenon among adults with intellectual disabilities has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the frequency and characteristics of cyberbullying and its correlates in individuals with intellectual disabilities attending training centers for adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods and procedures: A convenience sample of 269 participants (54.3% men and 35.7% women), aged 18-40 years was recruited from Chile (14.1%), Mexico (32%), and Spain (53.9%). Results: The findings showed that 15.2% have been cyberbullied 9.7% are currently being cyberbullied. Being different was the main reason (97.7%) for being cyberbullied. The behaviors happen in educational settings (46.67%), leisure/free time activities (31.11%), and associations for people with disabilities (15.56%). Verbal aggressions (74.53%) were the most common cyberbullying behaviors.

Revising theories of social cognition on the basis of schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders;RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Social cognition; Schizophrenia; Autism; Phenomenology; Cognitive science; Psychopathology; Theory of mind";"INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; 1ST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; DIRECT PERCEPTION; ADULTS; MIND; SIMULATION; BRAIN; DISSOCIALITY; EXPERIENCE";Schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that mainly impair social competence, while general intelligence (IQ) is spared. Both disorders have a strong ancillary role in theoretical research on social cognition. Recently the debate has started to be inflected by embodied and phenomenological approaches, which claim that the standard portrayal of all social understanding as so-called 'mindreading', i.e. the attribution of mental states to others in the service of explaining and predicting their behavior, is misguided. Instead it is emphasized that we normally perceive others directly as conscious and goal-directed persons, without requiring any theorizing and/or simulation. This paper evaluates some of the implications of abnormal experiences reported by people with schizophrenia and ASD for the current debate in cognitive science. For these people the practice of explicit mindreading seems to be a compensatory strategy that ultimately fails to compensate for - and may even exacerbate - their impairment of intuitive and interactive social understanding. Phenomenological psychopathology thereby supports the emerging view that 'mindreading' is not the principal form of normal social understanding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to further investigate whether this procedure would improve face recognition memory in 5- and 7-year-old children (Experiment 1) and adults with Down syndrome (Experiment 2). In a delayed matching-to-sample task, participants had to select the previously shown face (sample stimulus) among six alternatives faces (comparison stimuli) in four different delays (1, 5, 10, or 15 s). Participants were tested in two conditions: differential, where each sample stimulus was paired with a specific outcome; and non-differential outcomes, where reinforcers were administered randomly. The results showed a significantly better face recognition in the differential outcomes condition relative to the non-differential in both experiments.

What images of themselves and their classroom environments do novice teachers create when prompted to visualize themselves as 'motivating teachers'? What role do these visualizations play in supporting novice teachers in implementing methodological innovations? And do novice teachers value the use of visualizations?

The so-called Choose to Live Healthy Law (Elige Vivir Sano, EVS) was created in Chile in 2013. It proposes cultural change for the population by advancing sport and physical activity as health promoters. Under a biopolitics and governmentality framework, this study uses discourse analysis to understand several official documents that build the EVS discourse.

The study particularly centers on the analysis of interpersonal and ideational linguistic resources used by teachers and students that contribute to the inclusion of historical evidence in the discourse, in combination with the building of semantic waves (Maton, 2014, 2016) through the variation of semantic density and semantic gravity. The analysis shows that when teachers and students use a strong semantic gravity (SG+), they also have a tendency of employing a more heteroglossic-oriented discourse, whereas when teachers and students use a strong semantic density (SD+), their discourse tends to be oriented to more monoglossic choices in language (Martin & White, 2005). The language resources chosen by teachers and students in their pedagogical interactions impact how historical thinking is constructed in the classroom; particularly regarding the space, these more or less specialized and nonspecialized language resources provide for the incorporation of epistemic and axiological sources, which are necessary to build history as an interpretative social science through different levels of abstraction.

In particular, the article revolves around literacy practices used to teach the intercultural curriculum as implemented in eight schools from three different regions of Chile. The aims of this research were twofold: to identify the participants' perceptions about reading and writing in Mapuzugun and to analyze the pedagogical practices involving literacy in the classroom. Results show that literacy is not a central aspect in beliefs of the traditional educators charged with teaching the intercultural curriculum, despite there being a wide range of literacy practices displayed in the classrooms. We argue that literacy practices play a relevant role in the construction of hybrid social identities that bring together traditional school practices and a community's oral strategies.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis in 115 Spanish schoolchildren 4-to-7 years. Motor competence and HRQoL were assessed using the MACB-2 and the KINDL-R questionnaire, respectively. Results: ANCOVA model showed that children with DCD children obtained lower scores in physical well-being, friends, school and total HRQoL dimensions than TD peers after controlling for covariates (p < 0.05). Moreover, parents' perception scores in HRQoL were lower in children with DCD than in TD peers (79.7 vs 84.8; p = 0.022). Student T-tests for repeated-measures showed non-significant differences between children and parents' perceptions in mean HRQoL scores, by motor competence categories. The intraclass correlations coefficients between parents and children's perception of HRQoL was moderate in DCD category (0.62; p = 0.024) and small in TD category (0.29; p = 0.049). Conclusions: Children under 6 years old with DCD have lower HRQoL scores than their TD peers. No differences were found between children's and parents' perceptions in total HRQoL, although the perceptions of children and parents in DCD category showed a significantly higher level of agreement than TD children.

One of its key components is the emergence of the Traditional Educator, an indigenous person with the linguistic and cultural competencies necessary for teaching an indigenous language in a school context. Hence, this research is directed towards examining the perceptions of Traditional Educators regarding the teaching of indigenous languages. The contents of relevant documents and interviews with Traditional Educators from three groups of indigenous peoples (Mapuche, Aymara and Lican Antay) who participated in the study were analyzed using a qualitative methodology. Using the Critical Language Policies approach, the results were organized into three categories: (a) perceptions of Traditional Educators regarding the Intercultural Bilingual Education Program, (b) the relationship of Traditional Educators with other participants in the school system, and (c) teaching strategies declared by Traditional Educators for teaching in the Indigenous Language Class (Sector Lengua Indigena).

Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction is based on the assumption that physical representations of speech sounds and spectrography allow learners to objectively see and modify those non-accurate features in their oral production which may impede effective communication in the target language. Twenty-six pre-service non-native English teachers, 16 in the experimental group and 10 in the control group, participated in the investigation. During a two-week period, the experimental group received Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction while the control group was exposed to a more traditional pronunciation approach. Production accuracy of the target segments was evaluated by two production tasks and a perceptual identification task. Acoustic measurements from the production tasks show that Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction significantly improved pronunciation of both vowels. Data from perceptual identification also indicate pronunciation improvement of both vowels, particularly for English / I /.

The notion that interactants can modify their affective output in such fashion is referred in the literature as affective alignment (Ochs, 1988). By using linguistic anthropological methods, audio and video recordings of naturally occurring conversation involving 17 students and two teachers were analyzed for the use of verbal and non-verbal affective behavior. The analysis showed that students actively participated in an on-going negotiation of affective practices with their teachers. Moreover, learning the heritage language was related to and dependent upon other affective factors beyond students' immediate educational and instructional need. These findings provide us with a better understanding of the influence of the teachers' and students' affective behavior on one another, and on students' acquisition of their heritage language.

The results indicated that learners and NSs were comparable in terms of the amount of production but the NSs' speech contained more grammatical and lexical variability with a larger mean proportion of copula omissions.

To practice it, people have to invest money and time, which affects their personal and family lives, creating tensions and conflicts with relatives. Under a qualitative methodology, this study investigates the practices created by male and female athletes to reconcile family life and sports practice. The results show that triathletes undergo three processes: imbalance, adjustment and maintenance. The article closes by expressing that these processes may contribute to coaches, sports psychologists, and managers as much as the knowledge generated allows containing, facilitating and promoting positive processes among athletes and their families.;"[Soto-Lagos, Rodrigo Andres] Univ Andres Bello, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Diaz-Alday, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Soto-Lagos, RA (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;"rodrigo.solo@unab.cl; nat.diazalday@gmail.com";;SOTO-LAGOS, RODRIGO/0000-0002-3564-8419;;;;22;0;0;0;3;UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO SUL, ESCOLA EDUC FISICA;PORTO ALEGRE;RUA FELIZARDO, 750 JARDIM BOTANICO, PORTO ALEGRE, CEP90690-200, BRAZIL;0104-754X;1982-8918;;MOVIMENTO-PORTO ALEG;Movimento;OCT-DEC;2018;24;4;;;;;1191;1204;;10.22456/1982-8918.82760;;;14;"Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics";HL2JH;WOS:000458530300010;;gold;;;2022-04-06;

Informed by principles of participatory design, language learners, software designers, language teachers, and a computer programmer worked collaboratively in a series of design sessions. The participants first evaluated researcher-generated prototypes, designed prototypes for two language proficiencies (beginner and upper intermediate) and iterated designs on both paper and screen. Analysis of the reworked prototypes resulted in five features of help option design: type, location, sequence, click-through, and display. Analyses of the interaction data showed that consensually the participants favored help options that are easy to use, promote learner control, support guidance, and stimulate learning.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Vina Del Mar, Chile;;Cardenas-Claros, MS (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;monica.cardenas@ucv.cl;Cárdenas-Claros, Mónica S/Q-4932-2019;Cárdenas-Claros, Mónica S/0000-0003-4031-5392;;;;39;5;5;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0958-8221;1744-3210;;COMPUT ASSIST LANG L;Comput.

J;Lizama, MV;;;;Vidal Lizama, Margarita;;;A linguistic description of popular education: The enactment of pedagogy in the classroom;LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Systemic Functional Linguistics; Pedagogy; Popular education; Knowledge; Interaction";;The paper explores a practice of popular education in Chile, in order to provide a linguistically based description of its pedagogy based on two key pedagogic dimensions: knowledge and interaction. The study is informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics and explores ideational and interpersonal meanings realised in resources from the discourse-semantic stratum, which are understood to construe knowledge and enact social relations through language. Discursive analysis shows continuity and discontinuity in meaning patterns in classroom discourse. Prevalent ideational and interpersonal patterns show an orientation towards the construal of specialised knowledge and the enactment of hierarchical relations between participants. However, instances of discontinuity in discourse show that a more horizontal relation can be enacted when a different patterning of ideational and interpersonal meanings occurs. The paper argues that the pedagogy of popular education, deemed by the literature as 'democratic', becomes so by transmitting to its students knowledge that would be otherwise inaccessible while at the same time opening up the space for instances of more egalitarian interaction in the classroom.

This research uses a qualitative design that adopts discourse analysis to examine 57 essays by students between 12 and 17 years old. The essays addressed historical problems. With the help of experts in history and teaching history, nine essays were analyzed according to the categories of agency, construction of a causal chain, and perspective on the evidence. The results identified three ways that students build historical explanation: chronicle without a historical sense; narration without a historical sense; and narration with a historical sense. The authors conclude that in teaching and learning historical causation and the determination of historical problems, the relationship between the processes of reading and the analysis of evidence, as well as their organization and transfer into writing, must be considered.

This is due to their negative impact on youth development over time. LS refers to the evaluation people make of their lives and overall quality of life. Within the school context, there are several important dimensions to the development of LS among adolescents, such as peer relationships and also school climate. School satisfaction and school bonding are two dimensions of school climate which can affect the occurrence of bullying during the adolescence. Although there has been substantial research on children's LS, little research has been done in South America using longitudinal data to examine the importance of school variables that influence bullying and LS. Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine the long-term effect of school satisfaction, bonding, and bullying on adolescent LS one year after bullying victimization. Structural equation modeling was used on a sample of 555 Chilean adolescents with a mean age of 13.5 years old of which 42.9% are females. School satisfaction was negatively related to bullying perpetration, but not to bullying victimization. Conversely, school bonding was negatively associated with bullying victimization, but not with bullying perpetration. Lastly, bullying victimization was associated with lower levels of LS one year after the experience, even when controlling for age and gender. Bullying perpetration had no effect on LS. These results highlight the importance of school variables and peer relationships for adolescent LS development over time and reinforce the importance of preventative initiatives in schools.;"[Varela, Jorge J.; Sanchez, Paulina A.; Gonzalez, Constanza; Valenzuelal, Pilar; Cabrera, Tamara] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Av Plaza 680, Santiago, Chile; [Oriol, Xavier] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Santiago, Chile";;Varela, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Av Plaza 680, Santiago, Chile.;joyarela@udd.cl;Granado, Xavier Oriol/AAO-3112-2021;"Granado, Xavier Oriol/0000-0001-7130-7729; Sanchez, Paulina Alejandra/0000-0002-0357-8778; Gonzalez Matamala, Constanza/0000-0001-6748-9064";FONDECYT Iniciacion, CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170746];FONDECYT Iniciacion No 11170746, CONICYT, Chile.;;118;4;4;8;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1866-2625;1866-2633;;SCH MENT HEALTH;School Ment.

This study explores the educational inclusion of girls in mathematics classrooms. The coding of videos from 79 school lessons, involving 2,295 students, allowed us to compare how and how much teachers interact with male and female students, analyse the moderating effect of academic achievement in these interactions and explore the differences among classrooms with regard to the inclusion of girls. Teacher-student interaction networks were represented via sociograms and modelled with multilevel Poisson regression. We found that girls interact less frequently with their mathematics teachers in interactions of diverse content, and this is the case in interactions initiated by the teacher as well as those initiated by the student. Academic achievement moderates these differences only in pedagogical interactions initiated by students. There is also significant variation in the inclusion of girls among classrooms, which is not consistently explained by the gender of the teacher or the gender composition of the class.;"[Ortega, Lorena] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Trevino, Ernesto; Gelber, Denisse] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Ortega, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ IE, CIAE, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.;lorena.ortega@ie.uchile.cl;Ortega, Lorena/P-1879-2018;Ortega, Lorena/0000-0002-6471-0277;"Chilean National Research and Development Agency [ANID Projects] [PIA CIE160007, FONDECYT INICIACION 11190591]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";This study was funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency [ANID Projects PIA CIE160007 and FONDECYT INICIACION 11190591].

The analysis was performed manually using a taxonomy that incorporates and adapts criteria developed in the Cognitive approach to Coherence Relations and in the Connectivity Model. Results show that while some relations are used across school subjects (Conjunction, Concept Description), others are used almost exclusively in certain school subjects (Condition-Event in Science, Basic Contrast in History, Deictic in Language, and Condition-Question in Mathematics).

The available explanations are insufficient because they do not account for the evidence showing that gains in content knowledge are unrelated to group outcomes and are still evident weeks after collaboration occurs. The aim of this article is to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between peer-group argumentation and science content knowledge learning. A total of 187 students (aged 10 to 11 years) from 8 classrooms participated in the study, with the classrooms spread across 8 public schools, all located in Santiago, Chile. We conducted a quasi-experimental study randomized at school-class level. Four teachers delivered science lessons following a teaching program especially developed to foster dialogic and argumentative classroom talk (the intervention group), and four teachers delivered lessons in their usual way (the control group). Students were assessed individually using both immediate and delayed post-test measures of science content knowledge. The results showed no differences in pre- to post-immediate content knowledge between conditions. However, the intervention-group students increased their content knowledge significantly more than the control-group students between post-immediate and post-delayed tests. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that, after controlling for school-level variables, time working in groups, and scores in the pretest, the formulation of counter arguments, although occurring in both groups, significantly predicted delayed gains in the intervention group only. Moreover, the frequency of counterarguments heard by students during the group work did not make a difference. Focal analysis of one small-group work suggests that teachers' instructional practice may have contributed to the consolidation of students' knowledge at an individual level in a post-collaborative phase.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina; Lopez, Patricia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;"Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231";Fondo de Desarrollo Cientiifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431];This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientiifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants [1140995 and 1170431].;;112;11;11;3;22;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0737-0008;1532-690X;;COGNITION INSTRUCT;Cogn.

Hierarchical regression analysis identified a general model of age and verbal AR as significant predictors of overall emergent literacy performance and also pointed out the different contributions of the verbal and non-verbal AR to models of listening comprehension, lexical skills and phonological awareness. These findings contribute to the discussion on the dynamics of this relationship in the emergent literacy period and underscore the need to analyse specific analogical modalities in models of language development.;"[Norambuena, Yenie S.; Riffo, Bernardo E.; Saez, Katia L.] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";;Norambuena, YS (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Espanol, Victor Lamas 1290, Concepcion, Chile.;ynorambuena@udec.cl;;;National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170525];This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of Chile, Fondecyt, project No. 3170525.;;53;0;0;5;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0210-3702;1578-4126;;J STUD EDUC DEV;J.

A sample of 1684 university students in New Zealand participated in this study. Students' responses to an open-ended question were first inductively coded and then quantitatively analyzed using Chi-square independence test and logistic regression. The findings identified several situational, dispositional, and institutional factors that hinder student learning, among them financial difficulties and work commitments, health, and family issues were more dominant. These factors are perceived differently by students of different disciplines and ethnicities. For instance, Asian students were less likely to refer to financial difficulties and work commitments compared to the other ethnicities, whereas Pasifika and then Maori students perceived family issues more than other ethnic groups. STEM major students were more likely to believe the teaching quality restricts their learning than their non-STEM counterparts. The study findings have several educational and well-being implications for diverse bodies of students in tertiary education.;"[Radmehr, Farzad; Niazi, Najmeh; Rezvanifard, Faezeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Appl Math, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Radmehr, Farzad] Univ Agder, Dept Math Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Radmehr, Farzad] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway; [Farsani, Danyal] Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Educ Psychol & Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Farsani, Danyal] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Laban, Winnie] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Overton, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bakker, Leon] Victoria Univ Wellington, Planning & Management Informat, Wellington, New Zealand";;Radmehr, F (corresponding author), Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway.;f.radmehr65@gmail.com;"; Radmehr, Farzad/S-3150-2018";"Farsani, Danyal/0000-0002-9412-3161; Radmehr, Farzad/0000-0002-0592-9148";;;;59;0;0;3;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0729-4360;1469-8366;;HIGH EDUC RES DEV;High.

There is less research on the collaboration process itself, but an understanding of the process should help to improve both the process and the outcomes of collaboration. Understanding and analyzing collaborative learning processes requires a fine-grained analysis of group interaction in the context of learning goals. Taking into account the relationships among tasks, products and collaboration this paper presents a set of measures designed to evaluate the collaborative learning process. We emphasise: direct system-based measures based on data produced by a collaborative learning system during the collaboration process, and suggest that these measures can be enhanced by also considering participants' perceptions of the process.;"Univ Cauca, FIET, Dept Syst, IDIS Res Grp, Cauca, Colombia; Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; Bocconi Univ, IMQ Inst Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy; Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, Castilla, Spain";;Collazos, CA (corresponding author), Univ Cauca, FIET, Dept Syst, IDIS Res Grp, Cauca, Colombia.;"ccollazo@unicauca.edu.co; luguerre@dcc.uchile.cl; jpino@dcc.uchile.cl; stefano.renzi@unibocconi.it; jane.klobas@uwa.edu.au; Manuel.Ortega@uclm.es; Miguel.Redondo@uclm.es; Crescencio.Bravo@uclm.es";"Redondo, Miguel A./F-7852-2015; Klobas, Jane E/J-3384-2013; Guerrero, Luis/A-3900-2008; Pino, Jose/G-6404-2016; Ortega, Manuel/F-9191-2015; Bravo, Jose/F-8861-2015; Bravo, Crescencio/S-3921-2018";"Redondo, Miguel A./0000-0001-5809-3412; Klobas, Jane E/0000-0003-2146-7059; Pino, Jose/0000-0002-8466-6453; Ortega, Manuel/0000-0002-0194-7744; Bravo, Jose/0000-0001-5752-2406; Bravo, Crescencio/0000-0003-4380-1193; Collazos, Cesar/0000-0002-7099-8131";;;;57;55;58;5;10;INT FORUM EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOC-IFETS;DOULIU CITY;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

To close this gap, three different Latin American universities adapted an existing advising dashboard, originally deployed at the KU Leuven to their own context. In all three cases, the context was the main ruling factor to these adaptations. In this paper, we describe these adaptions using a framework that focuses on four different elements of the context: Objectives, Stakeholders, Key moment and Interactions. Evaluation of the adapted dashboards in the three different Latin American universities is conducted through pilots. This evaluation shows the value of the dashboard approach in different contexts in terms of satisfaction, usefulness and impact in academic decision-making and advising tasks. The main contribution of this paper is the systematic reporting of the adaptations to an academic advising dashboard and showing the value of an academic advising dashboard on academic decision-making and advising tasks.;"[Guerra, Julio] Univ Austral Chile, Undergrad & Grad Programs Informat & Comp Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita] Univ Ghent, Pedag Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita; Scheihing, Eliana] ESPOL, Informat Technol Ctr, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel Angel] Univ Cuenca, Fac Engn, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel Angel] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Scheihing, Eliana] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile; [Scheihing, Eliana] Carlos III Madrid Univ, Telemat, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez, Alberto] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Engn & Sci Educ Ctr LESEC, Leuven, Belgium; [Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Augment HCI Res Grp, Dept Comp Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [De Laet, Tinne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Engn Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Verbert, Katrien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, HCI Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [Verbert, Katrien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Leuven, Belgium; [Verbert, Katrien] TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Verbert, Katrien] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium";;"Zuniga-Prieto, MA (corresponding author), Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador.; Guerra, J (corresponding author), UACh, Fac Ingn, Valdivia 2086, Chile.; Ortiz-Rojas, M (corresponding author), ESPOL, Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Informat Technol Ctr, Campus Gustavo Galindo, Guayaquil, Ecuador.";"jguerra@inf.uach.cl; margarita.ortiz@cti.espol.edu.ec; miguel.zunigap@ucuenca.edu.ec";"; Broos, Tom/F-5424-2017; Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/V-7329-2017";"verbert, katrien/0000-0001-6699-7710; Scheihing, Eliana/0000-0003-1801-9167; Jimenez Macias, Alberto/0000-0002-1148-742X; Broos, Tom/0000-0002-4139-2608; De Laet, Tinne/0000-0003-0624-3305; Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/0000-0003-2193-8316";"LALA project [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre";The work was funded by the LALA project (grant no. 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP).

This is why educating implies asymmetry and hierarchy, that is, pedagogical authority. However, today's societies are decreasingly hierarchical, and subjects are more critical of authority. In a sociocultural context in which the classical forms of authority are weakening, young education students have to construct new meanings which they find coherent and effective. With the goal of exploring the new understandings of pedagogical authority, a study was conducted of 913 education students in different Spanish-speaking countries: Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Spain. The multinational analysis enabled us to identify cross-cutting meanings, as well as local understandings constructed by the education students in today's society. A questionnaire with both closed and open-ended questions was administered. The overall results indicate that viewing authority grounded in reciprocal respect between teachers and students cuts across the participants and is significantly associated with the teaching of academic knowledge.;"[Zamora-Poblete, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Gil-Madrona, Pedro] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Mendez-Hinojosa, Luz-Marina] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Galvis-Leal, Pedro] Univ Libre Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Tadeo-Morales, Jose] Univ Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela";;Zamora-Poblete, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Teoria & Polit Educ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;gzamora@puc.cl;"Leal, Pedro Galvis/AAR-6756-2021; Gil-Madrona, Pedro/H-5066-2015; Zamora, Guillermo/B-2067-2017";"Leal, Pedro Galvis/0000-0003-1217-3964; Gil-Madrona, Pedro/0000-0002-1503-6394; Zamora, Guillermo/0000-0002-9530-9144";;;;23;0;0;2;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC-UK;Cult.

However, its implementation into the curricula of dental schools is still limited. Our objective was to identify the main values related to professionalism based on the perceptions of students and faculty members from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile. Methods A Dental Values Survey was validated and culturally adapted in order to guarantee the greatest possible internal validity. The adapted survey was administered to students and faculty members (416 and 225, respectively). The final survey contained 64 items rated on a Likert scale of 1-5. Each item was categorised according to five dimensions: Altruism, Consciousness, Personal Satisfaction, Quality of Life and Professional Status. The values were compared between faculty and students and among students at different courses. A values scale was constructed by selecting the five items with the highest average score for each dimension. Results Survey respondents composed 34.32% of the universe, of which 50.46% were faculty and 49.54% were students. Values associated with Altruism, Consciousness and Professional Status, were the highest rated by students and faculty. Values associated with Personal Satisfaction and Quality of Life received the lowest scores for both groups. Conclusions To provide the best possible attention to patients (Consciousness), and that patients have access to affordable dental care (Altruism), are the values at the top of our scale. On the other hand, to maintain financial stability and to be well paid (Quality of Life) were the less considered.;"[Alcota, Marcela; Gonzalez, Fermin E.] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Dept Conservat Dent, Santiago, Chile; [Manriquez, Jose M.; Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Inst Res Dent Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Salinas, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Dept Prosthet, Santiago, Chile; [Catano, Victor M.] St Marys Univ, Dept Psychol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Ruiz de Gauna, Pilar] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Educ, Bilbao, Spain";;"Alcota, M; Gonzalez, FE (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Odontol, Dept Odontol Conservadora, Santiago, Chile.";"malcota@u.uchile.cl; fgonzalez@uchile.cl";Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco/I-1332-2013;"Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco/0000-0001-9147-5754; Gonzalez, Fermin E/0000-0002-4212-1009";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica;Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica;;47;0;0;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

This article analyzes the research culture of Latin American professors in 20 countries in the digital era, and their relationship with the production of scientific papers indexed in the Journal Citation Report (JCR) between 1996 and 2019. A questionnaire (with validity and reliability criteria) with a Likert-type scale was applied to 2,215 professors selected from five international scientific events. The main results show that 78% of the professors have less than 15 years of teaching experience, with ages under 44 years of age and 38.9% of them with an undergraduate academic level, 62.5% of whom responded that they have never published in indexed journals, and that they do not know the proper application of paradigms and research designs. On the other hand, 23.86% of the total citations are self-citations. Therefore, the results reflect a significant relationship between the research culture of professors and Latin American scientific production. Finally, Latin American professors have found themselves in economic, political and social circumstances that affect good research and scientific publication practices, leaving a training gap in research competencies in the new digital era.;"[Gonzalez-Diaz, Romel] Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia; [Acevedo-Duque, Angel] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Observ Polit Publ, Providencia, Chile; [Martin-Fiorino, Victor] Univ El Bosque, Fac Ingn, Bogota, Colombia; [Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena] Univ Nacl Jorge Basadre Grehmann, Fac Ciencias Salud, Tacna, Peru";;Gonzalez-Diaz, R (corresponding author), Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia.;"director@ciid.com.co; angel.acevedo@uautonoma.cl; vrmartin@ucatolica.edu.co; ecachicatariv@unjbg.edu.pe";"; Acevedo-Duque, Angel/G-5384-2015";"Cachicatari Vargas, Elena/0000-0002-9843-432X; Acevedo-Duque, Angel/0000-0002-8774-3282";;;;48;0;0;4;4;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN;2022;30;70;;;;;69;83;;10.3916/C70-2022-06;;;13;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";XF7DJ;WOS:000724228000006;;Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted;;;2022-04-06;

We use partial frontier approaches to mitigate the influence of outliers and the curse of dimensionality. Our estimation considers idiosyncratic variables at the school, class, and student levels. Our model is applied to a sample of students in fourth year of primary school in urban schools in Chile. Results are in line with previous findings that less than 30% of the variance in students' educational attainment is attributable to their schools. Results also corroborate that a model considering only student-level variables yields high inefficiencies not attributable to school management, but rather to inadequate resource-endowment policy. Therefore, when disregarding specific variables concerning the resources allocated to the schools, the performance of those schools is undervalued, largely because inefficiencies caused by suboptimal resource endowments or difficulties arising from the socioeconomic environment are instead attributed to poor school management.

Our test is based on employer learning-statistical discrimination models, which suggest that if employers use university reputation to predict a worker's unobservable quality, then college prestige should become less important for earnings as a worker gains labor market experience. In this framework, we use a regression discontinuity design to estimate a 13% wage premium for college graduates in their first year of the labor market who were barely accepted by one of the two most prestigious universities in Chile compared with those barely rejected by these two schools. However, we find that this premium decreases to 4% for workers with 6 or more years of labor market experience. This result suggests that college prestige becomes less important for employers as workers reveal their quality throughout their careers.;"[Bordon, Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Bordon, Paola] COES, Santiago, Chile; [Bordon, Paola] DESOC, Santiago, Chile; [Braga, Breno] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Braga, Breno] IZA, Bonn, Germany";;"Braga, B (corresponding author), Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.; Braga, B (corresponding author), IZA, Bonn, Germany.";bbraga@urban.org;;;"Millennium Nucleus in Social Development DESOC;  [ANID/FONDECYT/3160658];  [ANID/FONDAP/15130009]";We would like to thank John Bound, Charlie Brown, Sebastian Calonico, Nicolas Grau, Brad Hershbein, John Kennan, David Lam, Fabian Lange, Brian McCall, Jeff Smith, Christopher Taber, and participants at EconCon, IAAE Conference, IWAEE Conference, LACEA, SOLE-EALE World Conference, Southern Economic Association, University of Chile, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, the Urban Institute, and SAIS Johns Hopkins University seminars for their valuable comments.

This is especially applicable in the case of young people due to their high use of new technologies, as they are also trained with the necessary skills to do so. In this context, social networks have prompted the emergence of a new type of political participation: which takes place online. Therefore, this study delves into the relationship between the socialization that occurs in the network, digital skills and political participation online and offline. A quantitative survey-based methodology was used with university students from three Ibero-American countries: Mexico, Spain and Chile. The fieldwork was conducted between the months of December 2017 and June 2018. The results obtained show that young people consume mainly digital media, which does not prevent them from being critical with the quality they deserve. In this sense, the political participation actions in which they are involved are mostly developed in the network, thus participating to a lesser extent offline. Therefore, young people enter the world of politics through the consumption of information on the Internet, which favors a subsequent online political participation.;"[De-la-Garza-Montemayor, Daniel-Javier] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Pena-Ramos, Jose-Antonio] Univ Autonoma Chile, Providencia, Chile; [Recuero-Lopez, Fatima] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Granada, Spain";;De-la-Garza-Montemayor, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.;"danieldelagarza@gmail.com; japramos@ugr.es; frecuero@ugr.es";"RECUERO-LOPEZ, FATIMA/ABH-3223-2020; Peña-Ramos, José Antonio/AAM-8300-2020";"RECUERO-LOPEZ, FATIMA/0000-0001-7531-6817; Peña-Ramos, José Antonio/0000-0001-7073-9562; de la Garza Montemayor, Daniel Javier/0000-0001-6962-9059";;;;38;5;5;2;5;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;OCT 1;2019;27;61;;;;;83;92;;10.3916/C61-2019-07;;;10;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";JZ0BA;WOS:000504768000007;;Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold, Green Published;;;2022-04-06;

Using students who had an alternative source of funding as a control group, and administrative records before and after the reform, we present evidence that students are affected in different ways. First, we show that parents of students who ex ante were more likely to be credit restricted are more likely after the reform to report that their child ends up completing college. Second, we find that students in the same groups that increase their college expectations, obtain a score in high-stakes examination that actually qualified them for college aid.

As these events involve multiple victims, their identities must be confirmed using the highest possible quality standards. Forensic Odontology (FO) has proven to be a scientific resource for disaster victim identification (DVI) procedures; however, it is highly dependent on the proper management not only of material resources but also of human resources. Chile is a country recognised as prone to natural disasters, but an insufficient number of forensic odontologists has been reported. The aim of the study was to review the literature on a dental undergraduate (UG) student's potential value in a DVI process. Methodology A scoping review was performed using a specific search strategy in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO and EBSCO databases. Results The search identified 27 articles in which the basic dental degree, the necessary training and the need for human resources are variables considered in different priorities by those articles. Discussion It is vital to assess the local needs of Chile based on its UGs, considering that FO is an underestimated resource that should be included early on in dental curriculums.

Three ethnographic case studies were carried out, using individual interviews, focus groups, participant observations and document analysis in six schools. The main goal was to deeply understand how bottom up school initiatives, with a comprehensive use of digital technologies, are contributing to generate connected practices and to involve teachers, learners and communities in the discussion about what kind of society they want in their future, The results of the analysis indicate that fostering a transformative agency in secondary schools has the potential of engaging students in the exploration of contemporary social issues and that digital connectedness can contribute to connect schools with youth life trajectories and communities. This study on transformative agency and digital connectedness reveals a new path for educational transformation that may interest everybody who, in one way or another, are involved in education systems all around the world.;"[Erstad, Ola] Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway; [Mino, Raquel; Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Barcelona, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile";;Erstad, O (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway.;"ola.erstad@iped.uio.no; rmino@ub.edu; pablorivera@ub.edu";Vargas, Pablo Rivera/AAL-9231-2021;"Vargas, Pablo Rivera/0000-0002-9564-2596; Erstad, Ola/0000-0003-1712-300X; MORA RODRIGUEZ, ALBERTO/0000-0003-2247-6846; Mino Puigcercos, Raquel/0000-0002-5391-4637";;;;37;7;8;0;4;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN;2021;29;66;;;;;9;20;;10.3916/C66-2021-01;;;12;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";PN6AM;WOS:000604559500001;;Green Accepted, Green Published, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Studies assessing executive functions (EF) and social cognition in both groups have found preserved and impaired performances. These inconsistent findings would be partially explained by the cognitive variability reported in these disorders. First, the present study explored the inter-individual variability in EF and social cognition in both patient groups. Second, we compared differential characteristics and commonalities in the cognitive profiles of EF and social cognition between ADHD, AS and control adults. We assessed 22 patients with ADHD, 23 adults with AS and 21 matched typically developing subjects using different measures of EF (working memory, cognitive flexibility and multitasking) and social cognition (theory of mind and decision-making). Group comparisons and multiple case series analyses (MCSA) were conducted. The between-group comparisons showed an EF deficit in working memory in ADHD and a theory of mind (ToM) impairment in AS. The MCSA evidenced that, compared to controls, ADHD patients had a higher inter-individual variability in EF, while individuals with AS had a more heterogeneous profile in social cognition tasks compared to both groups. Finally, the AS and ADHD groups presented higher task-related variability compared to controls and shared a common heterogeneous profile in EF. This is the first study to compare variability in EF and social cognition profiles of ADHD and AS. We propose that heterogeneity in EF performance is a link between ADHD and AS which may explain the overlap of symptomatology between both diagnoses. In addition, patients with AS seem to show a unique heterogeneous profile in ToM which may explain the low probability of finding AS symptoms in patients with ADHD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is characterized by tissue fragility, joint hypermobility and a wide range of articular and non-articular manifestations, which often appear in infancy. The clinical picture of EDS-HT/JHS is poorly known by the medical community, as is the presence of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) problems in affected children. Aim: The present work reviews the clinical and empirical evidence for ESSENCE difficulties in children with EDS-HT/1E1S. Method: A narrative review of the literature was undertaken following a comprehensive search of scientific online databases and reference lists. This included publications of quantitative and qualitative research. Results: Motor abnormality, hyperactivity/hypoactivity, inattention, speech/language, social interaction, behavioral, sleep, feeding and emotional problems are ESSENCE difficulties for which there is some evidence of an association with EDS-HT/JHS. Conclusion: Children with EDS-HT/JHS present ESSENCE problems that often coexist and tend to be recognized before the HDCT. Clinicians encountering children with ESSENCE problems should consider the possibility of an underlying HDCT such as EDS-HT/JHS, probably influencing neurodevelopmental attributes in a subgroup of children. Awareness of these interconnected clinical problems might help improve early referral, diagnosis and treatment of EDS-HT/JHS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been conceptualized in this article using a framework depicting the affects of these shifts on learning environments that may change schooling and impact society. These trends provide new challenges for educational researchers at national and international levels, requiring attention to the interrelationships among the various components in an educational system. New evidence, which builds on earlier claims of an increasing digital divide between developing and developed countries, has shown that this phenomenon is much more complex than was previously thought. We suggest that a promising way to maximize the knowledge and impact of researching IT in education is to establish longitudinal programmatic research sustained through the establishment of E-learning observatories, which can bring together expertise across a range of disciplines. A major challenge in forming a clear and coherent strategy for researching IT in education lies in the fact that there are multiple stakeholders with differing aims, goals and objectives. Therefore, reciprocal relationships are needed in which practice informs research and research informs practice with support and guidance from policymakers.;"[Cox, M.

PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students' feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive.

We assessed the effectiveness of biodiversity education workshops in influencing knowledge, beliefs, personal norms and conservation behaviors among Chilean winegrowers. We used a switching replication design with pre, post and follow-up tests to measure the impact of two workshop formats on 164 participants at four wineries. Environmental knowledge increased after workshops and persisted over time. Perceived ability to reduce threats to biodiversity also increased, but only significantly at one winery. No differences were found between the conventional workshop, more focused on technology transfer, and the participatory format. The limited effect of the workshops on variables influencing behavior change suggests modifications are needed.

Drawing on research across four schools, this article examines how the dynamics between state-led top-down prescriptive guidelines interface with teacher practice, school objectives, and existing racializing dynamics to produce diverse educational outcomes. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research involving over 100 pupils and teachers, this article identifies two key in-school processes that work to undercut official policy effectiveness. First, state policies do little to challenge staff and institutionalized racism, thereby perpetuating the marking of Indigenous pupils as Other. Combined with lack of political will and resources for teacher training and lesson preparation, this leaves educational inequalities in place. Second, the institutional allocation of time and resources to intercultural education reinforces widespread devaluation of indigenous knowledge among teachers, educators and public opinion. Nevertheless, the study also found that in certain schools these conditions did not prevent the adoption of pedagogies that affirmed Indigenous difference and challenged the dominance of whiteness. Informed by a critical theorization of the power and unmarked nature of racial inequality, this article argues that whiteness is neither recognized nor challenged in rural secondary schools in southern Chile, despite its ubiquity and pervasive influence on curriculum, pedagogies and institutional arrangements.;"[Webb, Andrew] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Macul, Chile; [Radcliffe, Sarah] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England";;Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Macul, Chile.;Andrew.webb@uc.cl;;Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670;;;;41;5;5;1;33;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1361-3324;1470-109X;;RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK;Race Ethn.

In its commitment to provide education for all to age 18, Chile recently expanded its system of schools for teenage dropouts and has funded research on how best to educate these youth. This article, based on data from a national sample of 18 recently established Second Opportunity Centers, describes student characteristics, their ambitions for their education and future, and their evaluation of their experience to date. Using a review of principally North American research findings as a guide, the study analyzes factors linked with grade repetition and withdrawal from school to suggest strategies that may be effective in increasing retention of students. This article concludes that, given multiple causes of school failure, reintegration into the education system requires multiple strategies.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar; Gonzalez, Luis; Castillo, Dante] Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA USA";;Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Traslavina 450, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;pirata14@hotmail.com;Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019;"Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136";National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of Chile (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT [1161433];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development of Chile (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT Project No. 1161433.;;60;2;3;2;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0013-1245;1552-3535;;EDUC URBAN SOC;Educ.

In the first part of the article, central orientations in conceptualizing mathematics teacher knowledge are identified and the more serious limitations of the grounds on which they stand are explicated. In the second part of the article, alternative views are offered to each of these orientations that direct attention to underexplored issues about what makes mathematics teacher knowledge specialized. Collectively, these alternative views suggest that specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge cannot be comprehensively accounted for by what' teachers know, but rather by how' teachers' knowing comes into being. We conclude that it is not a kind of knowledge but a style of knowing that signifies specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge.;"[Scheiner, Thorsten] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Scheiner, Thorsten] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Scheiner, Thorsten] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Montes, Miguel A.; Carrillo, Jose] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain; [Godino, Juan D.] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Pino-Fan, Luis R.] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile";;"Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.; Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.";t.scheiner@auckland.ac.nz;"Scheiner, Thorsten/AAC-5903-2019; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/AAF-3293-2021; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/AAF-8804-2020; Pino-Fan, Luis R./Q-5687-2019; Carrillo-Yañez, José/J-4854-2016; Montes, Miguel/J-6841-2014";"Scheiner, Thorsten/0000-0002-1118-5958; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/0000-0003-3181-0797; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/0000-0003-3181-0797; Pino-Fan, Luis R./0000-0003-4060-7408; Carrillo-Yañez, José/0000-0001-7906-416X; Montes, Miguel/0000-0003-3181-0797";"Macquarie University; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150014];  [EDU2013-44047-P];  [EDU2016-74848-P]";Writing was done while the first author, Thorsten Scheiner, was a Klaus Murmann Fellow of the Foundation of German Business and completed while he was recipient of the Research Excellent Scholarship of Macquarie University.

Its early inception in 1813 resulted from the necessity of consolidating a republican order, as shown by the different projects between 1810 and 1813. During its first years, a revolutionary rhetoric emphasising discontinuities with the colonial past prevailed. Yet, after the consolidation of independence, institutional and intellectual links to the inherited Catholic tradition heavily affected the definite shape of the Instituto. In this context, the negotiations with the Catholic church and the role played by the moderate Juan Egana explain the fact that the model of republic related to the Instituto in its first decades focused on virtue and morality.;Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Liberal Arts, Santiago, Chile;;Ruz, AB (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Liberal Arts, Santiago, Chile.;afbaeza@gmail.com;;Baeza, Andres/0000-0001-7532-848X;;;;23;6;6;0;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0030-9230;;;PAEDAGOG HIST;Paedagog.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional, competencies have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural bottlenecks in the educational and social system. Finally, the lessons learned after more than 15 years of implementing technology in Chilean schools are presented and fully discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Regarding the first layer, there is much to learn from science teachers and science teacher educators when they are organised in sites of learning that can be spaces of hope, beginnings, and becoming, as is illustrated in the case of these two self-organised communities. Regarding the second layer, we discuss the value of dialogue and the possibilities it offers to develop ideas for science education in a way that might be democratising, emancipatory, and offering counter-narratives in a neoliberal Chile. By engaging in this dialogue revisiting the practices of our communities, we gained a sense of agency within the field of science education. However, we realised that we need to move towards a critical view within our communities, and more contextual and transformative science education by translating these sites of hope to our educational praxis today. For us, this relates both to developing a collective view of how to make science education provide pedagogical conditions and experiences for critical and engaged citizenship and thinking how we can act and engage with different settings in solidarity. One way of moving towards this is by developing a political knowledge of our disciplines through a collective scientific conscientisation. Our communities are the departure points to achieve this.";"[Torres-Olave, Betzabe] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Gonzalez, Paulina Bravo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Torres-Olave, B (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.;b.torresolave@bristol.ac.uk;;Torres-Olave, Betzabe/0000-0003-3599-1310;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID)/Scholarship Programme/Doctorado Becas Chile [2017 -72180111, 2015 -72160217];This work was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID)/Scholarship Programme/Doctorado Becas Chile/2017 -72180111, and Doctorado Becas Chile/2015 -72160217.;;79;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1871-1502;1871-1510;;CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT;Cult.

It is necessary to detail the precise actions that the teacher must perform in order to apply the proposed strategies for the integration of digital and non-digital resources. It is not about teacher training; it is about giving teachers the tools to structure their classes and empower them beyond the training process. Every aspect of the class should be specified, leaving what finally will be performed to the teacher. We conclude that an adequate orchestration helps to guide the teacher through the work to be performed in the classroom, allowing a shift from an instructor-centered arrangement, in which the teacher radiates knowledge before a passive class of students, to one where the students actively participate, with the teacher acting as a mediator.

It does so by comparing the effect of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) on the digital skills of Chilean students compared with mathematics and language. This comparison is made using national standardized tests. The marginal effect of a group of variables measuring student ESCS was compared both as a whole and separately using multivariate linear regression analysis. The results show that the marginal effect of ESCS as a whole on students digital skills was equal to the effect on mathematics and greater than the effect on language. Furthermore, the results show that the parents' level of education was the most relevant factor of ESCS for explaining student performance on the digital test, more so than for mathematics and language. These findings challenge the belief that the Internet would reduce economic, social and cultural inequalities in new generations. Instead, they reveal that the gap among Chilean students tends to perpetuate or widen when comparing performance in mathematics and language with performance in the digital domain. At the same time, by comparing national test results, this paper offers empirical evidence for the existence of a second digital divide in the field of education, a concept which is widely discussed at a theoretical level but with little empirical support to date.

In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed that assists in the design and classroom integration of educational games. The framework addresses both the educational dimension and the ludic dimension. The educational dimension employs Bloom's revised taxonomy to define learning objectives and applies the classroom multiplayer presential game (CMPG) pedagogical model while the ludic dimension determines the gaming elements subject to constraints imposed by the educational dimension. With a view to validating the framework, a game for teaching electrostatics was designed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An evaluation based on pre/post testing found that the game increased the average number of correct answers by students participating in the experiment from 6.11 to 10.00, a result found to be statistically significant. Thus validated, the framework offers a promising basis for further exploration through the development of other games and fine-tuning of its components. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These effects were studied using a sample of 1274 students from economically disadvantaged schools in Chile. The videogames were specifically designed to address the educational goals of the first and second years of school, for basic mathematics and reading comprehension. The sample was divided into experimental groups (EG), internal control groups (IC) and external control groups (EC). Students in the EG groups, used the experimental video games during an average of 30 h over a 3-month period. They were evaluated on their acquisition of reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematical skills, and on their motivation to use video games. Teachers' expectations of change due to the use of video games, their technological transfer, and handling of classroom dynamics, were assessed through ad hoc tests and classroom observations. The results show significant differences between the EG and IC groups in relation to the EC group in Math, Reading Comprehension and Spelling, but no significant differences in these aspects were found between the EG and the IC groups. Teacher reports and classroom observations confirm an improvement in motivation to learn, and a positive technological transfer of the experimental tool. Although further studies regarding the effects of learning through videogame use are imperative, positive effects on motivation and classroom dynamics, indicate that the introduction of educational video games can be a useful tool in promoting learning within the classroom.

New learning objects are usually assessed when students actually use the materials. To improve quality assurance in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not only considering student feedback, but also integrating other perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3 teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall quality of the learning objects.;"[Madariaga, Leonardo] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Engn Design Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 3939, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Gutierrez, Ivan; Barahona, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Madariaga, L (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Engn Design Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 3939, Santiago, Chile.;leonardo.madariaga@usm.cl;"Madariaga, Leonardo/M-2447-2017; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";"Madariaga, Leonardo/0000-0001-9338-5840; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983";ANID/FONDECYT [1180024];The research results informed in this report were supported by ANID/FONDECYT 1180024.;;75;1;1;11;48;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

A Course Management System (CMS), according to Social Constructivism framework, is an opportunity for fostering learning through interaction in a virtual environment for learning; hence, stimulating the use of a CMS for communication purposes seems quite appropriate. A quantitative analysis of 63.06% of the virtual classrooms was conducted, using the users log database to describe five variables: Participation, Informational Interaction Level, Communicational Interaction Level, and the use of Informational Resources and Communicational Resources in the CMS. An assessment of the first 2 years of implementation of Moodle in a campus confirmed prominence levels of interaction and resources that favor Information over Communication purposes in the use of the CMS. It is not conclusive whether this necessarily implies more or better learning; a profound qualitative study would be needed to answer these questions. Teachers and students show different behaviors in the face of this new ICT campus resource, while faculty members appear to have behaved in an erratic manner, students show steady levels of CMS usage.

Expanding on current scholarship, the article calls attention to the way everyday sensory experiences in schools models time in peculiar ways that have serious educational implications. On the one hand, based on the work of Katya Mandoki, we discuss how schedules and classroom movements tend to project an ominous sense of time, where students' sensibilities are neglected in favour of objective, regular and efficient rhythms. On the other hand, based on Yuriko Saito's account of Japanese garden design, we offer an alternative understanding of time that incorporates interruption, delay and 'unwrapping' as means to an enriched experience. The article concludes by identifying new questions and pedagogical orientations that contribute to reconsidering how schools teach to perceive, conceive and live time.;"[Marini, Guillermo; Rodriguez Merchan, Juan David] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Teoria & Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Marini, G (corresponding author), Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;gmarini@uc.cl;;Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151;;;;30;0;0;3;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0309-8249;1467-9752;;J PHILOS EDUC;J.

However, their appearance and growth pathways have had significant disparities. Design/methodology/approach Global and local agendas have had a strong influence on Chilean higher education institutions. A relevant signal has been the creation of the SCN, formed by 21 Chilean universities, whose vision is to help shape a fair and environmentally healthy civilization contributing from the higher education realm. This work adopts a survey design methodological approach. It describes the following resulting components obtained from the aggregated data: (a) emergence processes and environments, (b) governance models and operational mechanisms, (c) networks and collaboration, and (d) final products generated, for sustainability governing entities within universities in Chile. Findings The main findings indicate that at the institutional level, the Cleaner Production Agreement for higher education institutions and the creation of the SCN have been key drivers in the formalization of several entities leading the sustainability efforts within Chilean universities. Also, regarding the degree of commitment to sustainability, the most active internal stakeholder corresponds to students.

Making use of the features of Single Display Groupware and of Multiple Mice we propose a computer-supported collaborative learning approach for big groups within the classroom. The approach uses a multiple classification matrix and our application was built for language-learning (in this case Spanish). The basic collaboration mechanism that the approach is based upon is silent collaboration, in which students-through suggestions and exchanges-must compare their ideas to those of their classmates. An exploratory experimental study was performed along with a quantitative and qualitative study that analyzed ease of use of the software, described how the conditions for collaborative learning were achieved, evaluated the achievements in learning under the defined language objectives, and analyzed the impact of silent and spoken collaboration.

The teacher makes use of stored knowledge to choose the required contents so that the system automatically generates exercises. These exercises are completed and evaluated in real time, according to the student's reality, being able to mediate with the pupil to achieve the maximum session utilization. Control of the learning process is distributed among the student, the teacher, and the system, The student may choose the activities he/she likes to carry out, within a sub-group specified by the teacher, whereas the system specifies the exercise complexity, on the basis of the pupils performance. This work is grounded on knowledge re-utilization that makes use of pre-defined knowledge structures. These structures can be edited by a teacher to generate activities. These are carried out by a simulator, controlled by an expert system, that interacts with the student adjusting to the pupil's needs.

Three MSGs were developed and played by teams of four students in order to solve problems collaboratively. A quasi-experimental design was used. The data shows that the experimental group achieved a higher perception of their own collaboration skills and a higher score in the plan execution dimension of the problem solving cycle than did the non-equivalent control group, revealing that MSG-based learning activities may contribute to such learning improvements. This challenges future research to identify under which conditions learning activities based on mobile serious games can promote the development of higher order skills. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to what many people think, Lavoisier concluded that any change in volume in this experiment is negligible; moreover, the explanation relating oxygen consumption in the air with its change in volume is known to be wrong. In this work we briefly review the history behind the candle experiment and its relationship with some typical erroneous explanations. One of the key factors behind Lavoisier's success was the use of experiments carefully designed to test different hypotheses. Following these steps, we performed several closed volume experiments where the candle wick was replaced by a capillary stainless steel cylinder supported and heated by a nichrome filament connected to an external power supply. Our recorded experiments are displayed as web pages, designed with the purpose that the reader can easily visualize and analyze modern versions of Lavoisier's experiments. These experiments clearly show an initial phase of complete combustion, followed by a phase of incomplete combustion with elemental carbon or soot rising to the top of the vessel, and a final phase where the hot artificial wick only evaporates a white steam of wax that cannot ignite because no oxygen is left in the closed atmosphere.

Methods Cross-sectional and analytical study conducted on 726 first-year university students who replied three questionnaires: Youth Risk Behavior Survey, WHO Quality of Life-BREF scale, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results There were differences in overall quality of life (p < .001) and level of satisfaction in health (p < .01) according to screen exposure time. These results follow a linear trend for all the quality of life domains (p < .01), and they indicate that there is an inverse association between screen time and quality of life. Conclusion There is an inverse association between screen time and quality of life in university students. Students with a longer screen exposure time showed a lower quality of life, specifically in the domains of social relationships and psychological health, regardless of sex, physical activity, or socioeconomic level.;"[Lavados-Romo, Pamela; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Preclin Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Lavados-Romo, Pamela; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar; Morales, Gladys; Munoz, Sergio; Balboa-Castillo, Teresa] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Res Ctr Cardiometab & Nutr Epidemiol EPICYN, Temuco, Chile; [Morales, Gladys; Munoz, Sergio; Balboa-Castillo, Teresa] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Temuco, Chile";;Balboa-Castillo, T (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Res Ctr Cardiometab & Nutr Epidemiol EPICYN, Temuco, Chile.;teresa.balboa@ufrontera.cl;;"Morales, Gladys/0000-0001-7194-8833; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar/0000-0003-3359-4100; Munoz, Sergio/0000-0001-8383-6599";Universidad de La Frontera [IAF17-0009];This paper was supported by Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco-Chile [Project/Grant number IAF17-0009].;;48;0;0;5;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0744-8481;1940-3208;;J AM COLL HEALTH;J.

Most search engines base their algorithms on a resource's text or popularity, requiring teachers to navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource. This makes searching for resources a tedious and cumbersome task. Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aim to facilitate the discovery of quality resources. Nevertheless, the abundance and variety of content make searching a complex task. Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content by determining clusters of similar users and inferring users' interest in a resource, assembling clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both. Probabilistic model-based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make it possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with various degrees of probability. In this paper, we used recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers over the course of four years and under natural conditions. We found that a hybrid recommendation, the Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset. In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommender's accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results.;"[Peralta, Montserrat; Alarcon, Rosa; Pichara, Karim E.; Mery, Tomas; Cano, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Bozo, Jorge] Univ Catlica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile";;Alarcon, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;"mperalt1@uc.cl; rosa.alarcon@gmail.com; kpb@ing.puc.cl; tmery1@ing.puc.cl; ralarcon@ing.puc.cl; jorge.bozo@ucn.cl";;Bozo, Jorge/0000-0003-4073-5039;UC-Fundacion Chile ERAR: Evaluating Digital Learning Resources for Potential Recommendation project;The authors would like to thank Fundacion Chile - Educar Chile for making available the learning resources repository for this research.

This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for estimating the value of a new educational technology in three steps: benefit analysis, through the administration of a well-designed experiment; cost analysis, which incorporates costs to weigh against the benefits; and feasibility analysis, which introduces real-world concerns that may affect the ability to actually implement the technology. To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is used where portable educational video games were introduced into first and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in mathematics and language. This paper demonstrates the importance of all three steps in the evaluation process and provides a framework for future analyses. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of the interventions in promoting abstinent behavior reported in 12 controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the analysis indicated a very small overall effect of the interventions in abstinent behavior. Moderator analysis could only be pursued partially because of limited information in primary research studies. Parental participation in the program, age of the participants, virgin-status of the sample, grade level, percentage of females, scope of the implementation and year of publication of the study were associated with variations in effect sizes for abstinent behavior in univariate tests. However, only parental participation and percentage of females were significant in the weighted least-squares regression analysis. The richness of a meta-analytic approach appears limited by the quality of the primary research. Unfortunately, most of the research does not employ designs to provide conclusive evidence of program effects.

The model consists of five elements: the domain model, the student model, the pedagogical model, and the dynamic and static projection of learning. The system, based on stored expert knowledge, guides the child in what he or she is able to do and able to learn. Success is dynamically evaluated in order to constantly adjust the teaching methodology. The system contrasts with previous work by giving the teacher a major role, so that the expert system, the child and the educator form a conceptual triangle.

Il s'agit d'une experience educative developpee par un groupe de professeurs dans un quartier peripherique de Santiago du Chili. Cette initiative s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un mouvement syndical, social et pedagogique, le Mouvement de Consolidation de l'Education Publique. L'article a pour objet de visibiliser la constitution de la categorie sujet enseignant' dans cette experience particuliere. L'origine du mouvement se situe dans les principes definis par un mouvement educatif des premieres decades du XXeme siecle. L'experience a ete reconnue et valorisee, sous certains aspects, par la politique experimentale du Ministere de l'Education de la Republique du Chili. La proposition educative dont rend compte cette experience a reussi a s'inserer dans un processus social de transformations plus globales: des enfants et adolescents qui vivaient dans des conditions de vulnerabilite ont accede peu a peu au systeme scolaire, parvenant meme, dans certains cas, a s'incorporer a l'education superieure. Pour reconstruire les evenements historiques, on a eu recours a l'histoire orale, a travers des entretiens avec cinq professeurs protagonistes de cette experience. L'analyse de l'experience permet de montrer que la categorie sujet enseignant' emerge de l'articulation de quatre dimensions interdependantes, a savoir: la communaute, la politique educative, les pairs et la salle de classe. On en conclut que, dans des conjonctures historiques determinees, les sujets enseignants' creent de nouvelles pratiques dans tous ces domaines, qui transforment le systeme educatif. La possibilite se manifeste alors de construire un systeme educatif comptant sur la participation de la communaute educative, incorporant la culture locale et coherente a un projet de transformation sociale nationale.

Rigorous criteria were considered in the questionnaire's design and validation in order to achieve this objective: theoretical review, expert judgment, cognitive interview, pilot test, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The instrument was administered to 231 middle school students in Concepcion, Chile. Participants responded to the instrument after observing and interacting with science content using augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. After conducting the analyses, a latent structure with a good fit for the data was obtained, consisting of 16 items that underlie the latent variables, interactivity, presence, and flow.

However, most of the research has been done with children beyond the ages of early childhood. This could be due to the common and erroneous belief that young children have not developed the capacity to work collaboratively toward a given aim. In this paper we show how small group co-located collaborative learning on a single display computer improves oral language, logical-mathematical and social skills in pre-school children. Considering that early childhood teachers have a responsibility to provide a supportive environment, teacher mediation is essential in order to achieve collaborative learning. Thus, teachers were trained in the use of the technology and strategies for effective collaborative learning. The study was implemented in 10 kindergarten classrooms with 268 children between the ages of 5 and 6 years old. A group of 5 kindergarten classrooms with equivalent characteristics participated as a comparison group.

For a week, Smartphone devices which beeped seven times a day were given to School Principals and Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units, who then answered closed questions about their current agenda. Six municipal schools in a district of the V Region of Chile participated in the study. The main results support the notion that, at the time of data collection, most school Principals and Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units were working alone, and if they were interacting with other people, they were always in command. Following underlying assumed roles, most school principals reported performing administrative tasks, while Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units mainly addressed instructional issues, fostering a rigid framework for the assignment of tasks. Follow-up semi-structured interviews confirmed that participants were not working as a team but rather alone on important issues and urgent matters. Participants regarded the use of the device as a very practical and useful tool to analyze their daily practices. Results are discussed focusing on the use of portable technology to address methodological issues faced when approaching research on educational leadership from a distributed leadership perspective.

J;Bellolio, C;;;;Bellolio, Cristobal;;;Disaggregating the Creationist Challenge to Liberal Neutrality;JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"SCIENCE; RELIGION";In the US and elsewhere, creationist groups have challenged the mandatory science curriculum because it introduces the theory of evolution as the true story of biodiversity. This paper disaggregates this challenge in two distinctive levels. On the substantive level, creationists claim that Darwinian evolution is not value-neutral, as most scientists portray it, but it works as a philosophically-loaded theory that amounts to naturalism, which is a comprehensive doctrine that undermines traditional theism. Creationists then contend that its exclusive teaching violates the liberal promise of religious neutrality. To restore metaphysical fairness, they propose to include non-naturalistic theories into the official curriculum as a way of balance. On the epistemic level, creationists criticise liberal institutions-from courts of justice to educational boards and executive officials-that demarcate science in a way in which supernatural hypotheses can never compete for the best factual explanation. Under the guise of a purely methodological naturalism, they argue, liberals are opting for a cognitive filter that is biased against the belief that God intervenes in cosmic history. To restore epistemological fairness, they propose that theories that suggest supernatural agency should be rehabilitated and eventually included in the science curriculum. In these two distinct levels, the creationist claim is advanced as a logical implication of political liberalism's purported commitment to religious impartiality.;[Bellolio, Cristobal] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Hernando de Aguirre 1738, Santiago, Chile;;Bellolio, C (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Hernando de Aguirre 1738, Santiago, Chile.;cristobal.bellolio@uai.cl;Bellolio, Cristóbal/M-3111-2019;Bellolio, Cristóbal/0000-0002-7547-7773;;;;69;0;0;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0309-8249;1467-9752;;J PHILOS EDUC;J.

To support such activities, the Kelluwen platform provides a complementary micro-blogging tool called Worklog. In this study, we analyze data collected from Worklog messages generated by 101 cohorts of students from different schools and different levels, who participated in Kelluwen activities. We first used machine learning techniques to discover three types of messages which coincide with three dialogic functions; referential, phatic, and emotional. We then analyze how different factors of the cohort and group setup relate to the presence of different dialogic functions in Worklog. Results show the positive effect of pairing groups of students from different schools, and the positive influence of teacher participation.

However, there is no clear methodology for guiding the design of these types of games. To remedy this, we propose a structured methodology for the design of conceptual physics games that explicitly integrates the principles of the intrinsic integration approach for designing instructional games (Habgood & Ainsworth, 2011) with an atomic analysis of the structure of games (Cook, 2007; Cousins, 2005; Koster, 2005). To test this approach, we redesigned an existing game to teach electrostatics and compared the educational effectiveness of the original and redesigned versions. Our studies also compared an endogenous fantasy version of the game with a non-fantasy version. Our results showed that students who played the game which had been redesigned using the Atomic Intrinsic Integration Approach achieved a statistically significant improvement in results and showed fewer conceptual problems than the students who played the original version. The fantasy and non-fantasy versions, however, did not display any significant differences in outcomes. Based on the analysis and redesign of the game, we defined one possible methodology to assist in the design of games for the conceptual understanding of physics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a conceptual history approach allowed us to analyse the meanings attributed to the concept of quality in the design and implementation of two evaluation systems: The Educational Quality Assessment System (SECE, Spanish initials) and the Educational Quality Measurement System (SIMCE, Spanish initials). The findings show a transformation in meaning for the concept of quality. It moved from the operationalisation, management, and improvement of school systems to equating quality with the results of educational evaluations. This new definition of quality resulted from decisions by the Chilean State, which simplified its complexity and helped manage the new school system. An implication of this semantic transformation is the understanding of quality as a tool used to rank schools.;"[Galioto, Carmelo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile; [Perez Navarro, Camila] Univ OHiggins, Inst Educ Sci, Rancagua, Chile";;Galioto, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile.;cgalioto@uc.cl;;;;;;76;0;0;3;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0030-9230;1477-674X;;PAEDAGOG HIST;Paedagog.

Drawing and interpreting graphs play a key role in the understanding of science, while the lack of these has proved to be a handicap and a limiting factor in the learning of scientific concepts. It has been observed that despite the amount of previous graph-working experience, students of all ages experience a series of difficulties when trying to comprehend graphs or when trying to relate them with physical concepts such as position, velocity and acceleration. Several computational tools have risen to improve the students' understanding of kinematical graphs; however, these approaches fail to develop graph construction skills. On the other hand, Robots have opened new opportunities in learning. Nevertheless, most of their educational applications focus on Robotics related subjects, such as robot programming, robot construction, and artificial intelligence. This paper describes a robotic activity based on face-to-face computer supported collaborative learning. By means of a set of handhelds and a robot wirelessly interconnected, the aim of the activity is to develop graph construction and graph interpretation skills while also reinforcing kinematics concepts. Results show that students using the robotic activity achieve a significant increase in their graph interpreting skills. Moreover, when compared with a similar computer-simulated activity, it proved to be almost twice as effective. Finally, the robotic application proved to be a highly motivating activity for the students, fostering collaboration among them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is not clear what school-related factors most contribute to explaining students' perception of school safety, and how they relate to community-related factors such as neighborhood safety. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors associated with Chilean elementary and middle school students' perceptions of school safety. We used a sample of 5,455 students from low socioeconomic status public schools, and analyzed the predictive value of peer physical and verbal victimization; teacher and school staff victimization; teacher's social support; and perception of safety in the students' neighborhoods on perceptions of school safety. Findings showed that although different forms of school violence, particularly peer physical victimization and physical and sexual victimization from teachers and school staff, contribute to students' perception of school safety, the highest contribution came from students perceiving their neighborhoods as unsafe. In contrast, teacher social support contributed to increased levels of perceived school safety. We discuss the need for school-based interventions that address physical victimization and engage teachers in prosocial and less punitive approaches to foster a positive and safe school climate, and in fostering school-community partnerships.";"[Lopez, Veronica; Ascorra, Paula; Morales, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Lopez, Veronica; Ascorra, Paula; Morales, Macarena] Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Torres-Vallejos, Javier] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos-Parada, Boris; Carrasco, Claudia] Univ Playa Ancha, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gilreath, Tamika D.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bilbao, Marian] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Av El Bosque, Sausalito 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;veronica.lopez@pucv.cl;"Carrasco, Claudia/AAF-6848-2021; Bilbao, M.

Indeed, curricula have already been developed that, through tailored support for peer argumentation. promote both content knowledge and argumentation skills simultaneously. However, we do not yet know how to optimize the occurrence of peer argumentation, although there are suggestions in the literature that computers may have a role to play. Likewise, there are uncertainties about the mechanisms through which the benefits of peer argumentation are achieved, especially whether (and how) there is interdependence across the two types of benefit. In this paper, we report a quasi-experimental study randomized at class level, which addresses these two issues. A total of 502 fourth-grade students and 20 classes and teachers covered a module in science under three conditions: (1) using a curriculum that was already known to promote peer argumentation and content knowledge (standard support). (2) using the same curriculum but with additional computer-based support (computer-enhanced support), and (3) a routinely taught control group. Students' argumentation skills and content knowledge were assessed. Content knowledge was assessed prior to and after the intervention, with immediate and delayed posttests. Multiple regression analyses showed that peer argumentation was indeed most frequent in the computer-enhanced condition. Moreover, on the basis of a multilevel path analysis, we found that individual contributions to peer argumentation had a direct effect on posttest argumentation skills and an indirect effect on posttest content knowledge, both immediate and delayed. The indirect effect of argumentation on delayed posttest content knowledge was mediated by immediate posttest knowledge and posttest argumentation skills.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Singer, Vivian; Moran, Camila; Sanchez, Alvaro; Silva, Maximiliano; Villavicencio, Constanza] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine; Silva, Maximiliano] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England; [Lopez, Patricia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pinochet, Jorge] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Dept Phys, Nunoa, Chile";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;;"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Pinochet, Jorge/0000-0002-5703-5699";Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA [ID14I10094, ID14I20094];This work was supported by Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA ID14I10094 and ID14I20094.

The effects of academic performance and school misconduct on receiving academic and friendship nominations were examined, as well as the interplay between academic and friendship relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which similarity in adolescents' academic performance and school misconduct contributed to the formation and maintenance of academic and friendship relationships was examined. Sex, socioeconomic status, and structural network features were also taken into account. Longitudinal social network analyses (RSiena) indicated that (1) in high-ability classrooms students chose high-achieving peers as academic partners; (2) in high-ability classrooms students avoided deviant peers (i.e., those high in school misconduct) as academic partners; and (3) academic relationships led to friendships, and vice versa, in both high- and low-ability classrooms.

One primary criticism focuses on the artificiality of the results derived from its internal structure because of the ipsative nature of the forced-choice format. This study seeks to contribute to the resolution of this debate. A short version of Kolb's LSI with a forced-choice format and an additional inventory scored on a Likert scale was completed by a sample of students of the University Catolica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile. The data obtained from the two forms of the reduced version of the LSI were compared using principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and the Thurstonian Item Response Theory model. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of four learning mode dimensions. However, they do not support the existence of the learning styles as proposed by Kolb, indicating that said reports are the product of the artificial structure generated by the ipsative forced-choice format.;"[Calderon Carvajal, Carlos; Lay-Lisboa, Siu; Briceno, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Norte, Sch Psychol, Antofagasta, Chile; [Ximenez Gomez, Carmen] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain";;Carvajal, CC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Psychol, Ave Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.;ccalderon@ucn.cl;"Calderón, Carlos/AAT-4733-2021; Ximenez, Carmen/Q-6819-2018";"Calderón, Carlos/0000-0002-9237-3749; Ximenez, Carmen/0000-0003-1337-6309";Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico of Chile, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150182];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was financially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico of Chile, FONDECYT 11150182.;;70;1;1;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0734-2829;1557-5144;;J PSYCHOEDUC ASSESS;J.

Drawing on a trait interaction model, we propose novel idea generation as resulting from the interaction between openness to experience and need for cognition, because the first facilitates expressive intellect, while the second leads to controlled intellect Furthermore, we propose novel idea implementation as a joint function between openness to experience, need for cognition and organizational fairness. This three-way interaction relies on social-exchange and trait activation theories, highlighting that the translation of novel thoughts into implementation depends on contextual activation of individual dispositions. This was supported in a survey study based on a sample of 220 full time employees from diverse organizations. These findings expand theory on personality and creativity, informing work psychologists about how to identify employees with creative potential and how to manage the workplace to foster this potential.

In a randomized trial, the program showed moderate to large impacts on classroom quality but no impacts on targeted child outcomes. To unpack these findings, we examined intervention fidelity (IF) in both treatment and control groups. Specifically, the study examined (a) whether teachers in the treatment group showed greater fidelity to teaching practices prescribed by the intervention, as measured by dosage and adherence, at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten, than their control-group counterparts; and (b) whether language and literacy instructional dosage predicted gains in children's language and literacy outcomes at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten. IF data were coded minute by minute from videotapes of study classrooms collected at the beginning of prekindergarten, the end of prekindergarten, and the end of kindergarten. There were significant and large impacts of the intervention on dosage and adherence. Additionally, small but statistically significant associations were found between 2-year accumulated overall program dosage and children's reading and writing skills at the end of kindergarten. Results reveal that teacher practices changed in response to the intervention, but that increases in time spent on language and literacy instruction were not very substantial. This pattern may explain the absence of an overall impact on children's skills in the experimental study.

First, using a multilevel analytic approach (n=2597), the study shows that, after controlling for socio-demographic variables and the university admission tests, writing skills significantly predict first-year university grades. Second, using information about the performance of students during their first eight semesters in the university (n = 1616), a longitudinal hierarchical analysis showed that writing remains a significant predictor of university grades over time, also after controlling socio-demographic variables and university admissions tests. Moreover, language skills retain or improve their predictive role over time, whereas mathematics skills seem to decrease in their importance. Our results show that writing, and the cognitive skills involved in writing, play a critical role in advanced stages of academic training, consequently offering additional support for the consideration of this ability for university admission purposes.

The study yielded a validated Spanish language version of the PIMRS Teacher Form and offers a model of scale validation for other scholars who are interested in preparing an instrument for use outside of its culture of origin. The researchers used a back translation and expert panel procedure combined with psychometric analysis in order to achieve cultural equivalency for the translation. Psychometric properties of reliability (G Theory test of reliability) and validity (CFA, Rasch analysis) of the new version were assessed and compared to the original version in order to underpin its validity. The validation study employed a sample of 595 teachers and 26 principals in Santiago, Chile. The study yielded both a comprehensive analytical approach to cultural adaptation of survey instruments, as well a scale that can be used in Spanish speaking contexts. The study further demonstrated variability in patterns of instructional leadership practice across several national contexts.;"[Fromm, German; Volante, Paulo] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Fac Educ, Educ Leadership, Santiago, Chile; [Hallinger, Philip] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Educ, Educ Management, Bangkok, Thailand; [Hallinger, Philip] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Educ Leadership & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Wang, Wen Chung] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Educ Psychol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wen Chung] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Assessment Res Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";;Hallinger, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Educ, 244 Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.;hallinger@gmail.com;"Volante, Paulo/AAD-5031-2021; Hallinger, Philip/H-6071-2013";"Wang, Wen-Chung/0000-0001-6022-1567; Hallinger, Philip/0000-0002-5935-7544";Research Grant Council (RGC) of Hong KongHong Kong Research Grants Council [GRF 841711];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support of the Research Grant Council (RGC) of Hong Kong for its support through the General Research Fund (GRF 841711).;;68;9;9;0;20;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

The IE-basic progam is aimed at enhancing domain-general cognitive functioning in a number of areas (systematic perception, self-regulation abilities, conceptual vocabulary, planning, decoding emotions and social relations) as well as transferring learnt principles to daily life domains. Participants were children with DCD, CP, intellectual impairment of genetic origin, autistic spectrum disorder, ADHD or other learning disorders, with a mental age of 5-7 years, from Canada, Chile, Belgium, Italy and Israel. Children in the experimental groups (N = 104) received 27-90 h of the program during 30-45 weeks; the comparison groups (N = 72) received general occupational and sensory-motor therapy. Analysis of the pre- to post-test gain scores demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) advantage of experimental over comparison groups in three WISC-R subtests (Similarities, Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement) and Raven Coloured Matrices. Effect sizes ranged from 0.3 to 0.52. Results suggest that it is possible to improve cognitive functioning of children with developmental disability. No advantage was found for children with specific aetiology. Greater cognitive gains were demonstrated by children who received the program in an educational context where all teachers were committed to the principles of mediated learning.

One of the approaches to this type of innovation consists of using the platforms where MOOCs are hosted for the development of courses that are aligned to their on-campus curricular contents. They are known as Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), which allow online access to knowledge for groups of students with a well-defined profile. The platforms where MOOCs (and SPOCs) are hosted have been designed to support large volumes of data and visits. However, these platforms present important limitations regarding the implementation of collaborative learning activities. To address this problem, this article presents MyMOOCSpace, a cloud-based mobile system aimed at supporting effective collaboration in MOOCs, by combining key aspects of collaboration from the research area of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) with game-based dynamics. MyMOOCSpace has been tested in three quasi-experiments that were run in four Latin-American universities with a total of 68 participants. The objective was to assess its usability and its effect in enhancing collaboration among students in a SPOC. The results obtained on usability show that MyMOOCSpace is easy to use, and that participants felt pleased with while using it.

It has advantages over other previous works published since it is modular, flexible, interactive, easy to use, and the results are closer to the experimental ones because it takes into account real complex effects, such as: motor core saturation, parameter variations with the speed and temperature, sensor signal digital processing, and inverter real voltage waveforms. These results has been successfully applied in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses at the authors' universities for building, identification and characterization of diverse control schemes, analysis of parameter effects, and design and test of new controllers for field oriented control schemes in induction motors. Beside the theoretical and computational basis of the toolbox, simulation results of an indirect field oriented control current regulated pulse width modulation scheme are presented in the article as example.

It is in this context that students use a variety of practices to prepare assessments and exams appropriately. On the other hand, in recent years, higher education institutions have been using the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as an alternative to expand and innovate their traditional classroom practices. In this field, some alternatives have been generated in these platforms to extend their functions beyond the courses proposed. MyMOOCSpace is a cloud-based tool that improves the interaction of students participating in a MOOC course. However, a variation of this tool allows for improved collaboration and preparation of assessments and/or tests for students in a traditional higher education class. This article presents a study using the MyMOOCSpace tool as an alternative to encourage collaboration and preparation of students to take traditional tests or assessments in the field of higher education. To evaluate this application and demonstrate the impact on the results of the evaluations, a case study is presented in which 40 computer engineering students from a Chilean university participated. The results show that MyMOOCSpace generates a positive increase in student interaction regarding the subjects covered in the course, and that it helped them to study and prepare for the final exam of the subject.;"[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Ramirez-Donoso, Luis] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, FICT, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France";;Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DCC, Santiago, Chile.;llramirez@uc.cl;Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014;Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963;"Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile [1000/532/14]; Corfo Project 2030 [14ENI2-26862]; MOOCMaker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161264]";"Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile, Grant number: UBO' H Rect.

Depending on which part is needed to recover, the denser product or the pure liquid, we use the term thickening or clarification to define these operations. Thickener design is compulsory for chemical engineering (CE) curricula and is usually introduced in courses related to unit operations. Thickening design problems are solved by geometric methods (e.g., Coe-Clevenger or Kynch-Roberts methods). However, nowadays, computers play a more and more important role in CE practice. Both specific and general software solutions are essential. Whereas CE-specific software is adequate for graduates and professionals, general mathematical software can also be used in class. They can help to deliver certain competences included in the vast majority of CE curricula. For CE introductory courses, software with integrated functions and friendly interfaces are generally preferred over those that require to be familiarized with programming languages. Here, we describe the use of SMath Studio in 2nd-year engineering courses by nonfamiliarized students. SMath Studio is a comprehensive mathematical notebook, similar to Mathcad, but it is entirely free for personal or commercial use. In this study, student's opinion was surveyed. Around 70 students took part in the two-phase survey. The use of SMath allowed students to better understand the theoretical basis, fostered critical thinking, and increased their motivation to apply this software for solving other engineering problems.;"[Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Navarro-Lopez, Elvira; del Carmen Ceron-Garcia, Maria; Beas-Catena, Alba; Sanchez-Miron, Asterio; Garcia-Camacho, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Beas-Catena, Alba] Univ Concepcion, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Concepcion, Chile; [Ruiz-Ortega, Ana; Beas-Catena, Alba] Andres Bello Univ, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Dept Humanities, Concepcion, Chile";;Gallardo-Rodriguez, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.;jgr285@ual.es;;"Sanchez Miron, Asterio/0000-0001-5119-8035; Gallardo Rodriguez, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2953-7699";University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project) [17-003];University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project)., Grant/Award Number: 17-003;;15;0;0;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Literature shows medical students' deficiencies in these skills. Simulation has been used to train these skills. However, exposing learners to simulation at an early stage may be associated with a high cognitive load and limited learning. This study aims to determine how students experience this load and its interplay with performance and which factors promote and impair learning.Methods: Fifty-six final year medical students participated in a simulated ward round training exercise. Both students' performance and cognitive load were measured to determine if there was any correlation and interviews were carried out to understand which factors support and impair learning.Results: Performance scores revealed deficiencies in ward round skills. Students experienced a cognitive load that weakly correlated with performance. Qualitative findings provided important insights into simulated ward-based learning. It is clear that well-designed clinical scenarios, prioritization tasks, teamwork and feedback support students' learning process whereas distractions impair learning.Conclusions: WRS proved to be a good teaching method to improve clinical skills at this stage as the cognitive load is not too high to impair learning. Hence, including tasks in the simulation design can enhance the learning process.;"[Behrens, Claudia] Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Coquimbo, Chile; [Dolmans, Diana H. J.

However, investigations of perceived stress amongst Spanish-speaking student groups are sparse. This study aimed to (i) describe the translation, adaptation and psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Dental Environment Stressors questionnaire and (ii) to examine the perceived sources of stress and their associations with the students' study year and gender in two dental schools in Latin America. Materials and methods All students officially registered in the dental schools of the University of San Sebastian (USS) in Chile and the Catholic University of Cordoba (CUC) in Argentina were invited to participate in the study. The DES30 questionnaire was adapted in Spanish using translation/back-translation, an expert bilingual committee, and consensus building. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the instrument's internal consistency, and iterated principal factor analysis with promax rotation was employed to explore its underlying factor structure. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate methods were used to examine the patterns of association between individual stressors, factor scores and students' characteristics. Results Three hundred and four students comprised the study's analytical sample, with two-thirds of those being female. The DES30-Sp demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's a similar to=similar to 0.89). A four-factor solution emerged and included academic workload, clinical training, time constraints and self-efficacy beliefs factors. Fear of failing a course or a year, examinations and grades and lack of time for relaxation were amongst the top individual-item stressors reported by students in both schools. Amongst this group of undergraduate dental students, those in Argentina, in higher study year, and females reported higher perceived stress. Conclusions Increased workload, time constraints and some aspects of clinical training were the top stressors of approximately 300 Chilean and Argentinean dental undergraduates. Some variations between schools, males and females and study years were noted. The Spanish version of the DES30 questionnaire performed well, but future studies should evaluate the instrument's properties in larger and more diverse dental student populations.;"[Fonseca, J.; Pizarro, S.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Divaris, K.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Villalba, S.] Catholic Univ Cordoba, Sch Dent, Dept Paediat Dent, Cordoba, Argentina; [Fernandez, M.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Concepcion, Chile; [Codjambassis, A.] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Grad Studies, Off Res & Grad Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Villa-Torres, L.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Polychronopoulou, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Community & Prevent Dent, Athens 11528, Greece";;Divaris, K (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, 228 Brauer Hall,CB 7450, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;divarisk@dentistry.unc.edu;"Divaris, Kimon/E-4706-2011; Divaris, Kimon/AAU-8735-2021";"Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Fernandez, Marcelo/0000-0002-6980-6219";;;;62;20;27;1;45;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

According to these policies, older persons should become full participants in the development process of a society, sharing in its benefits, while policies and actions should promote a positive view of aging. The present paper sets out to report some of the results from the evaluation of four PUMAs offered in 20092010 at four Universities: Autonoma University of Madrid (Spain), Autonoma University of Mexico (Mexico), Catholic University (Chile), and La Habana University (Cuba). With this purpose, a study with quasiexperimental design and nonequivalent control group was carried out. In total, 313 students (75% women, age range 5087) on these four PUMAs and 190 controls (77% female, age range 5091) participated in this evaluation study. Pre- and postexperimental and control comparisons results yielded significant differences in the expected direction: those people attending PUMAs significantly improved their self-perception of aging and group stereotypes, as well as significantly reduced their negative affect, and improving their emotional balance. At the same time, their perception of cultural age stereotypes became more negative. The results are discussed from the point of view of the II International Plan of Action on Aging objectives: the reduction of negative stereotypes and the promotion of the role of PUMAs in active aging.;"[Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio; Marta Santacreu, Lda.; Dolores Zamarron, Maria] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol & Hlth Psychol, Fac Psychol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Caprara, Mariagiovanna] Madrid Open Univ, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Schettini, Rocio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Univ Program Older Adults, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Bustillos, Antonio] Spanish Open Univ, Social Dept, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Mendoza-Nunez, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Orosa, Teresa] Univ La Habana, Fac Psychol, Havana, Cuba; [Kornfeld, Rosita; Rojas, Macarena] Catholic Univ Chile, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Dolores Lopez, Maria] La Salle Univ, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Angeles Molina, Maria] Inst Adv Social Studies, Cordoba, Spain";;Fernandez-Ballesteros, R (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol & Hlth Psychol, Fac Psychol, Ivan Pavlov 6, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.;r.fballesteros@uam.es;"Molina, Mª Ángeles/ABG-9931-2020; Bustillos, Antonio/L-4668-2014; Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio/C-6503-2011; Schettini, Rocío/ABH-1833-2020; Mangeles, Molina/ABH-4292-2020; Zamarrón, Loles/L-4879-2013; Molina, Mª Ángeles/L-2185-2014; Caprara, Mariagiovanna/ABH-4424-2020; SANTACREU, MARTA/AAA-2882-2019; Schettini, Rocío/ABA-8169-2021";"Molina, Mª Ángeles/0000-0001-9354-6763; Bustillos, Antonio/0000-0003-2142-9335; Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio/0000-0001-7357-9082; Schettini, Rocío/0000-0002-5985-5164; Zamarrón, Loles/0000-0001-8500-9765; Caprara, Mariagiovanna/0000-0001-7560-4966; SANTACREU, MARTA/0000-0003-4108-7635; ";;;;36;20;21;2;52;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0360-1277;1521-0472;;EDUC GERONTOL;Educ.

This has heightened the need for media literacy in the region. In this context, the changes that have occurred were analyzed in order to propose a critical agenda from the perspective of teachers. First, a desk research of official sources was carried out to learn about the strategies of the four countries under study: Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Secondly, eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis. The results shed light on the need for relevant ICT training from a media literacy perspective, and strategies to address connectivity gaps, lack of adequate environments and work overload.

Understanding the learning development of educators in Intercultural and Bilingual Education (IBE) preschools for the education of Indigenous peoples is the focus of this study. In this context, the overall research question of this study is: What learning occurs for teachers in IBE preschools in the Metropolitan Region, Chile and how does this learning happen? Using Engestrom's expansive learning model (2001) and an ethnographic approach, this study found peer learning to be a critical but untapped resource for teacher learning in this setting, and also found there to be differences between Mapuche and non Mapuche teachers' understandings of the goals of their learning. Implications point to setting up teacher learning based on a model of peer learning which focuses on Mapuche educators contributing more than they currently do to the learning of non-Mapuche teachers in IBE preschools.;"[Becerra-Lubies, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarr, Villarrica, Chile; [Varghese, Manka] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA";;Becerra-Lubies, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarr, Villarrica, Chile.;rubecerra@uc.cl;;; [CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746];This work was supported by Grant CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746;;51;0;0;4;41;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1367-0050;1747-7522;;INT J BILING EDUC BI;Int.

Generally, the analysis procedures used follow the fragmentation and articulation proposals from the Grounded Theory. The conclusion is that such a system does not answer to a quality concept previously specified. It shows an important conceptual limitation in the health/physical condition relationship.

J;"Hao, J; Humphrey, SL";;;;"Hao, Jing; Humphrey, Sally L.";;;Reading nominalizations in senior science;JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES;;;English;Article;;;;;;;SCHOOL SCIENCE;The paper examines the challenges faced by senior Biology students in reading 'nominalizations' in textbook materials and illustrates how the challenges can be addressed through pedagogical activities. The study draws on emerging descriptions of field and discourse semantics in Systemic Functional Linguistics that are inspired by Halliday's distinction between 'live' and 'dead' grammatical metaphors. It first presents a metalanguage to discriminate functions of nominalization. Two different kinds of 'mismatches' of meaning are discussed, including how field activities are reconstrued through discourse semantic resources, and how discourse semantic resources are remapped as lexicogrammatical resources. The paper attends to nominalization from the perspective of the knowledge that is at stake in its use. In addition to providing linguistic metalanguage, the paper demonstrates pedagogic practices designed to support teachers to make this knowledge visible. These pedagogic practices include cross-mode redescription and Detailed Reading from SFL-informed Reading to Learn pedagogy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The research-pedagogy dialogue;ELT JOURNAL;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Instructed second-language acquisition (ISLA) research endeavours to make positive changes in pedagogical practices. In this regard, there is a recent debate concerning whether teachers are (or should be) willing to engage with research. To investigate the research-pedagogy link, the current case study conducted interviews with 12 EFL teachers in Chile. The findings suggested that teachers' understanding of research was relatively consistent with SLA researchers' practices, although their awareness of instructionally oriented research was low. Teachers were willing to use research because it gave them emotional support and helped them deal with novel pedagogical issues. The use of research was facilitated by external pressure in the current landscape of higher education. However, teachers lacked physical accessibility to research such as time and resources as well as institutional support. They shared invaluable advice to researchers in promoting the research-pedagogy dialogue, such as creating communities of practice and conducting classroom research.;"[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile; [Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist & German Slav Asian & African Langu, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Second Language Studies Doctoral Programme, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile.;"masatoshi.sato@unab.cl; loewens@msu.edu";Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533];This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) awarded to the first author as the co-investigator.;;14;22;23;3;7;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0951-0893;1477-4526;;ELT J;ELT J.;JAN;2019;73;1;;;;;1;10;;10.1093/elt/ccy048;;;10;"Education & Educational Research; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics";"Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)";"Education & Educational Research; Linguistics";HQ7BM;WOS:000462574400001;;Bronze;;;2022-04-06;

These challenges require new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between language and content as well as new pedagogies that incorporate a dual focus on language and content in subject matter instruction. This article describes three professional development contexts in the U. S., where teachers have engaged in language analysis based on functional linguistics ( for example, Halliday & Hasan, 1989; Christie, 1989) that has given them new insights into both content and learning processes. In these contexts, teachers in history classrooms with English Language Learners and teachers of languages other than English in classrooms with heritage speakers needed support to develop students' academic language development in a second language. The functional linguistics metalanguage and analysis skills they developed gave them new ways of approaching the texts read and written in their classrooms and enabled them to recognize how language constructs the content they are teaching, to critically assess how the content is presented in their teaching materials, and to engage students in richer conversation about content.";"[Achugar, Mariana] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Schleppegrell, Mary] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Oteiza, Teresa] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";;Achugar, M (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;;Oteiza, Teresa/R-9310-2019;;;;;49;57;58;1;12;UNIV WAIKATO;HAMILTON;SCH EDUCATION, PRIVATE BAG 3105, HAMILTON, 00000, NEW ZEALAND;1175-8708;;;ENGL TEACH-PRAT CRIT;Eng.

In the construction of results, the units of meaning a) fight for recognition of the right to enjoy territory by bicycle; b) solidarity with others in safe sharing of public roads; c) perception of the environment and d) communication of the bicycling activist movement resulted in the category Pedaling as a human right to active mobility in the city.

This qualitative study aims to analyze how the representation of others' suffering in films affects youths' empathy towards others different from them in terms of generation and cultural distance. We explore how empathy is expressed as semiotic processes of feelings and meanings in a contrastive cross-cultural case study. Using data collected from two college level language classrooms in two different countries (Uruguay and Chile) from two groups (one of regular university students and one of study abroad students), we contrast youths' responses to a film about violations of human rights during the Uruguayan military dictatorship (Migas de Pan, 2016). The film's representation of the violation of human rights experienced by young people during the dictatorship enables audiences to identify with the protagonist in spite of the temporal and cultural distance that separates them. Our findings suggest that the semiotic construction of feelings distinguishes the degree and intensity of youths' understanding of others' experiences. The conclusion discusses how personal trajectories and sociocultural identities influence the meaning making process of past experiences. Finally, we explore possible educational implications of these findings. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It identifies personal, professional and institutional barriers to achieving this social role and considers proposals from the teachers to overcome these barriers. Three focus groups were created and 12 in-depth interviews were carried out. The methods of analysis employed were anchored in the perspectives of fragmentation and articulation, as expressed in grounded theory. The paper concludes that, for some teachers, a dichotomic relationship exists between a physical education that reproduces a traditional approach (linked to sports and physical condition) and some specific social stereotypes, while for other teachers this relationship is a complementary one. There is another perspective that suggests that physical education can help develop the ability among students to comprehend and transform social inequalities.;"[Moreno-Dona, Alberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Escuela Educ Fis, Valparaiso, Chile; [Rivera-Garcia, Enrique; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Educ, E-18071 Granada, Spain";;Moreno-Dona, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Escuela Educ Fis, Grp Estudio Motricidad & Educ, Ave El Bosque 1290, Valparaiso, Chile.;"alberto.mo-reno@ucv.cl; erivera@ugr.es; ctriguer@ugr.es";"Moreno-Doña, Alberto/ABG-2494-2020; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen/B-4116-2014; Rivera-García, Enrique/J-7260-2017";"Moreno-Doña, Alberto/0000-0002-4277-0535; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen/0000-0001-7870-1411; Rivera-García, Enrique/0000-0002-7748-1741";;;;39;5;7;0;22;UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO SUL, ESCOLA EDUC FISICA;PORTO ALEGRE;RUA FELIZARDO, 750 JARDIM BOTANICO, PORTO ALEGRE, CEP90690-200, BRAZIL;0104-754X;;;MOVIMENTO-PORTO ALEG;Movimento;;2014;20;;;;SI;;81;96;;;;;16;"Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics";CC5KI;WOS:000350397100008;;;;;2022-04-06;

Despite their potential to promote comprehension and efficiency, research on the role of help options has lagged. Previous research has found that learners do not often make use of help options. With a focus on the interventions listeners may deem relevant for comprehension and task completion, the aim of this qualitative study is to examine the interactions of language learners as they use, or do not use, these potentially assistive resources. Data were gathered from 15 adult learners of English who worked with a set of Longman English Interactive (c) (2008) listening exercises over three one-hour sessions.

This review surveys the instructed SLA research, both classroom and laboratory-based, that has been conducted primarily within the interactionist approach, beginning with the core constructs of interaction, namely input, negotiation for meaning, and output. The review continues with an overview of specific areas of interaction research. The first investigates interlocutor characteristics, including (a) first language (L1) status, (b) peer interaction, (c) participation structure, (d) second language (L2) proficiency, and (e) individual differences. The second topic is task characteristics, such as task conditions (e.g. information distribution, task goals), task complexity (i.e. simple or complex), and task participation structure (i.e. whole class, small groups or dyads). Next, the review considers various linguistic features that have been researched in relation to interaction and L2 learning. The review then continues with interactional contexts, focusing especially on research into computer-mediated interaction. The review ends with a consideration of methodological issues in interaction research, such as the merits of classroom and lab-based studies, and the various methods for measuring the noticing of linguistic forms during interaction.

This paper aims to discuss the research issues and policy implications critical for achieving such a curriculum goal. A review of literature in the related fields indicates that K-12 schools should take advantage of e-learning to maximize learning opportunities of learners for the development of 21st century skills. We identify six research issues critical for e-learning in school education, namely the realization of developing 21st century skills of learners; the bridging of the gap between curriculum in school and situations in society; the maximization of learning opportunities in the learning process; the collection of evidence of improvement and building awareness of progress; the assessment of 21st century skills; and the provision of teacher development for enculturating learners to develop 21st century skills. We recommend the relevant stakeholders across different countries/regions to consider policies on the goal-setting of curriculum addressing 21st century skills development and bridging gap between school and society; on the availability of digital technology for school education; on the privacy/legal issues of learning data in e-learning process; and on the teacher development for pre-service and in-service teachers.";"[Kong, Siu Cheung; So, Wing Mui Winnie] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chan, Tak-Wai] Natl Cent Univ, Zhongli City, Taiwan; [Griffin, Patrick] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hoppe, Ulrich] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Huang, Ronghuai; Yu, Shengquan] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kinshuk] Athabasca Univ, Athabasca, AB, Canada; [Looi, Chee Kit] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Milrad, Marcelo] Linnaeus Univ, Kalmar, Sweden; [Norris, Cathleen] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Soloway, Elliot] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";;Kong, SC (corresponding author), Hong Kong Inst Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;"sckong@ied.edu.hk; chan@cl.ncu.edu.tw; p.griffin@unimelb.edu.au; hoppe@collide.info; huangrh@bnu.edu.cn; kinshuk@athabascau.ca; cheekit.looi@nie.edu.sg; marcelo.milrad@lnu.se; norris@unt.edu; mn@ing.puc.cl; mike.sharples@open.ac.uk; wiso@ied.edu.hk; soloway@umich.edu; yusq@bnu.edu.cn";"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Looi, Chee-Kit/ABG-9043-2021";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; So, Wing-mui Winnie/0000-0002-9649-074X";;;;34;34;35;1;73;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Adolescents' beliefs about parental legitimacy and obligation to obey declined with age. The steepest decline occurred during early adolescence, particularly in the personal domain. Adolescents who were uninvolved in problem behavior and perceived their parents to be supportive or high in monitoring at Wave 1 were more likely to endorse parental legitimacy and obligation to obey over time. There was little evidence that parenting or problem behavior moderated the normative decline in adolescents' beliefs about parental authority. Findings concerning individual differences in adolescents' endorsement of parental authority are highlighted in this study.;"[Darling, Nancy] Oberlin Coll, Dept Psychol, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Cumsille, Patricio; Martinez, M.

Little is known about the factors explaining this variability, and consequently there is a lack of adequate knowledge about how to utilize this association to improve treatment. The present study had the following objectives: (a) to examine the associations between within-and between-individual variability in alliance and outcome, controlling for previous symptomatic levels; (b) to examine the duration of the alliance-outcome association; and (c) to examine potential moderators of the alliance-outcome association. A total of 547 patients treated in a primary care psychotherapy setting in Chile were randomly assigned to 5 feedback conditions. The alliance-outcome association was analyzed using multilevel models, disentangling changes in alliance within-individuals from alliance between-individuals. Patient and therapist characteristics were examined as potential moderators. Findings suggest that patients who reported a better early alliance also reported a better outcome. Furthermore, patients reporting time-specific improvement in alliance also reported a greater reduction in symptoms. The unique effect of alliance on outcome at one point in time is maintained for a period of 2 weeks. Patients with more severe symptoms and longer treatments benefited more from a good alliance. Therapists identifying themselves as more integrative in their treatment orientation were able to better utilize good alliances for treatment success.

J;Holm-Hadulla, RM;;;;Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M.;;;The Dialectic of Creativity: A Synthesis of Neurobiological, Psychological, Cultural and Practical Aspects of the Creative Process;CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"PSYCHOTHERAPY; PERSPECTIVE";In the beginning of the 21st century, creativity has been highly esteemed not only in the arts and sciences, but also in economy, politics, and individual welfare. Most theories and practical applications stem from individual sciences and frequently conclude with generalizations that cannot be derived from the specific scientific paradigm. It seems necessary to mark the limitations of individual scientific approaches and to detect where interdisciplinary perspectives are indispensable. This article is an attempt to investigate the interdependence and complementarity of neurobiological, psychological, and socio-cultural, as well as practical, aspects of creativity. It is shown that creativity is often a dialectical process apparent in psychological, cultural, and even neurobiological research. The dialectic of order and chaos seems to be a general concept that is conceived differently by the individual sciences and transports different meaning. However, it is shown that different scientific concepts also contain corresponding and complementary knowledge which amplifies scientific perspectives through interdisciplinary interpretation. The dialectics between coherence-incoherence, stabilization-destabilization, construction-deconstruction of cognitions, emotions, and actions are shown to be corresponding and complementary principles. The interdisciplinary interpretation of the findings of individual sciences leads to practical implications.;"[Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M.] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M.] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile";;Holm-Hadulla, RM (corresponding author), Univ Altklinikum, Gartenstr 2, D-691115 Heidelberg, Germany.;Rainer.Holm-Hadulla@stw.uni-heidelberg.de;;;;;;61;19;22;0;28;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-0419;1532-6934;;CREATIVITY RES J;Creativ.

Participants were first- and second-born siblings (M age = 14.94 years for firstborns and M age = 12.46 years for secondborns) from 185 predominantly White, working and middle-class families. In home interviews, siblings reported on their dyadic family relationships. For reports of parent-child warmth but not parent-child conflict, results were consistent with sibling differentiation theory: Increasing differences between siblings over time in parent-child warmth were linked to trajectories of increasing warmth and decreasing conflict in the sibling relationship as reported by firstborns, and increasing warmth in the sibling relationship as reported by secondborns. The findings support the view that sibling differentiation may be a strategy for managing sibling conflict and rivalry.;"Penn State Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Catholic Univ Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;Feinberg, ME (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, 109 S Henderson, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;mfeinberg@psu.edu;Cumsille, Patricio/M-3564-2014;;"EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD029409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01-HD29409] Funding Source: Medline";;;38;63;65;6;36;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0009-3920;1467-8624;;CHILD DEV;Child Dev.;SEP-OCT;2003;74;5;;;;;1261;1274;;10.1111/1467-8624.00606;;;14;"Psychology, Educational; Psychology, Developmental";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Psychology;725HF;WOS:000185537600003;14552397;;;;2022-04-06;

Whilst the directive includes dental practitioners, it is recognised that significant variation exists in curriculum structure, content and scope of practice across institutions. This article aimed to explore pan-European practice in relation to curriculum content, teaching and learning strategies and assessment of pre-clinical dental skills. MethodA request to complete an online questionnaire, in English, was sent electronically to skills leads at all Association of Dental Education in Europe member schools. The questionnaire collected information in relation to institution and country, regulatory requirements to demonstrate safety, details of specific pre-clinical skills courses, learning materials and teaching staff. ResultsForty-eight institutions, from 25 European countries responded. Seven countries (n=7, 28%) reported no requirement to demonstrate student operative safety prior to patient treatment. Several core and operative clinical skills are common to the majority of institutions. The most commonly taught core skills related directly to the clinical environment such as cross-infection control and hand washing. The least common were skills that indirectly related to patient care, such as communication skills and working as a team. ConclusionThere are clear differences within European pre-clinical dental education, and greater efforts are needed to demonstrate that all European students are fit to practice before they start treating patients. Learning outcomes, teaching activities and assessment activities of pre-clinical skills should be shared collaboratively to further standardise curricula.;"[Field, J.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Stone, S.] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Orsini, C.; Crothers, A.] Glasgow Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Orsini, C.] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile; [Hussain, A.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Vital, S.] Univ Paris 05, Montrouge, France; [Walmsley, D.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England";;Field, J (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;j.c.field@sheffield.ac.uk;"Walmsley, Anthony D/V-8585-2018; Vital, Sibylle/AAK-3479-2021; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Field, James/AAG-8901-2021";"Vital, Sibylle/0000-0001-6352-2525; Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Field, James/0000-0002-5462-4156; Walmsley, Damien/0000-0003-4970-0764; Stone, Simon/0000-0002-7426-3159";;;;17;8;8;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Data from three large-scale longitudinal data sets, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, and Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement, were used to answer this question by employing quantile regression analyses. After controlling for demographic variables, child characteristics, and early ability, the findings indicate that self-concept of ability in math and reading predicts later achievement in each respective domain across all quantile levels of achievement. These results were replicated across the three data sets representing different populations and provide robust evidence for the role of self-concept of ability in understanding achievement from early childhood to adolescence across the spectrum of performance (low to high).;"[Ines Susperreguy, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Davis-Kean, Pamela E.; Chen, Meichu] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";;Susperreguy, MI (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;misusper@uc.cl;"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019";"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Davis-Kean, Pamela/0000-0001-8389-6268";"PATHWAYS International Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme for the Comparative Study of Productive Youth Development (Jacobs Foundation) at the Institute of Education, University College London; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [102215/2/13/2]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0322356]; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary ActivitiesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1519686] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G9815508, MC_PC_15018] Funding Source: researchfish";We thank Amy Claessens, Greg Duncan, Mimi Engel, Robert Siegler, and Tyler Watts for their helpful contributions to this project.

Middle-class Chilean mothers and children (N = 875; 52% males) were studied when children were 1, 5, 10, and 16 years (1991-2007). Results indicated that highly depressed mothers provided less emotional and material support to their child across all ages, which related to children's lower IQ. Children with lower mental abilities at age 1 received less learning-material support at age 5, which led to mothers' higher depression at child age 10. Mothers' low support was more strongly linked to maternal depression as children got older.

Methods: Statistical analysis of PHEEM scores from 1563 sets of data, using reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlations of factors derived with the three defined PHEEM subscales. Results: PHEEM was very reliable with an overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.928. Three factors were derived by exploratory factor analysis. Factor One correlated most strongly with the teaching subscale (R=0.802), Factor Two correlated most strongly with the role autonomy subscale (R=0.623) and Factor Three correlated most strongly with the social support subscale (R=0.538). Conclusions: PHEEM is a multi-dimensional instrument. Overall, it is very reliable.

Four groups were identified: one no-risk profile and three risk profiles, impoverished and undereducated, depressed and impoverished, and father-absent and impoverished. All classes differed in EP.

Infants (54% male) were studied at childhood (M-age=10years) and adolescence (M-age=14years). IDA in infancy was related to excessive alcohol use and risky sexual behavior in adolescence through its effect on poor emotion regulation in childhood. Attentional control deficits at age 10 were also related to both infant IDA and heightened risk taking in adolescence.

Aim: The present study explored the relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma among caregivers of autistic children in Latin America. Additionally, explore contextual factors that better explain the perception of stigma when accessing services. Methods and Procedure: Approximately 2500 caregivers from six Latin American countries completed an online survey. Descriptive inferential analysis and a pointbiserial correlation were conducted to understand direct relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma and to test their relationship. Added contextual factors contributing to this relationship were examined through a binary logistic regression. Outcomes and Results: Barriers to accessing services predicted stigma. Contextual factors such as country of residence, frustration experienced by caregivers, gender of autistic child and challenging behaviours had higher odds of experiencing some form of perceived stigma. Conclusions and Implications: These results suggest experiences with stigma to be heavily influenced by environmental factors such cultural differences which in combination with contextual factors could further increase the likelihood of perceiving stigma. When observing stigma within a social-cognitive approach, it is possible that a strong-held adherence to cultural norms, in addition to negative experiences (e.g., frustration) when accessing services, could be influencing caregivers perceived stigma.;"[Montenegro, Maria Cecilia; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Abdul-Chani, Monica] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Psychol, 1720 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Valdez, Daniel] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales Sede Argentina F, Tucuman 1966,C1050 AAN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20,Torre AIRD,2do Piso, Santo Domingo 10109, Dominican Rep; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Av 18 Julio 1824, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA, Domingo Repetto 1145,CP B1640EMQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Presbiteriana Mackenzie UPM, Programa Posgrad Disturbios Desenvolvimento, Rua Consolacao 930, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Ave Libertador Bernardo Higgins 1058, Santiago 8330111, Chile";;Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), 1200 Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.;cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu;"Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022; paula, cristiane/D-8968-2017";"Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rattazzi, Alexia/0000-0001-7993-2123; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; paula, cristiane/0000-0003-0438-9407; Garrido Candela, Gabriela/0000-0001-8841-8425; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422";;;;69;0;0;2;2;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0891-4222;1873-3379;;RES DEV DISABIL;Res.

However, few studies have analysed this relationship regarding children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome (DS). In this paper, we analyse the impact of SES in the neurodevelopmental trajectories of children with DS in comparison with children with TD. Method Cognitive, language, motor and socioemotional development were assessed in 31 children with DS between the ages of 15 and 8o months from high to low SES backgrounds. Data from this group were compared with data from a sample of 72 children with TD randomly selected from the Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood. We analyse and compare these two groups using the developmental trajectories method Results The results show delayed onsets for the four abilities measured in children with DS compared with children with TD from high to low SES. In the comparison of the developmental trajectories, we found that the differences between the neurodevelopmental trajectories in DS and 113 vary according to SES. High SES show differences only in language development, while low SES show significant differences in cognitive, language and socio-emotional development. Conclusions The results indicate that SES is a factor that could impact the developmental trajectories of children with DS. Although the differences between children with DS and with TD are similar at the beginning regardless of SES, the developmental trajectories are slower in children with DS of low SES than in children of high SES. We argue that the differences are related to the complex interaction of several biological and cultural factors associated with SES. Some specific hypotheses about nutrition, health care access, quality of education and parenting practices are presented, but more research in this area is needed to fully understand these results.;"[Arango, P.

The current study assessed the efficacy of an extra-class program, eighteen weeks long, to promote the behavioral and cognitive engagement (self-regulated learning, SRL) of Gypsy children from fourth grade. Gypsy communities were contacted, and the 35 Gypsy children in the 4th grade (10 to 12 years old) participating in the study were randomly distributed in the experimental and control groups. The program used a story-tool to organize the weekly sessions due to the cultural value of stories and the oral transmission of values in Gypsy communities. Children's behavioral engagement and self-regulatory behaviors in the classroom were assessed with an observation protocol. The 35 Gypsy children were observed throughout the duration of the program in 12 five-minute intervals for a total of 60 min. The findings show the efficacy of the program for promoting behavioral engagement and enhancing SRL strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The participants were 61 biology teachers and their corresponding 1,518 high school students (12th grade). The first sample was used to fit the model, and the second sample was used to analyze the consistency of the data derived from the first sample. Using a two-level SEM analysis, we established whether the effects found at the individual level varied significantly at class level. The students' approaches to learning were related to the teachers' approaches to teaching as a function of the hypotheses established in the model, although the effect size was smaller than expected. However, approximately 48 % of the variance of the surface approach and 46 % of the deep approach sat at class level. At the individual level, the results of this study suggest that students' approaches to learning significantly explain their teachers' approaches to teaching and, thus, constitute important contextual variables. At the class level, the way students learn appears to be closely associated with class-related variables. Our data stresses the importance of promoting educational opportunities (e.g., school-based courses) for teachers to reflect upon the teaching methodologies used in class.;"[Rosario, Pedro; Paiva, Olimpia; Pinto, Ricardo] Univ Minho, Dept Psychol, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunez, Jose; Vallejo, Guilermo] Univ Oviedo, Asturias, Spain; [Valle, Antonio] Univ A Coruna, Galicia, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Psychol, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;"prosario@psi.uminho.pt; jcnunezperez@gmail.com; gvallejoseco@gmail.com; olimpiapaiva0212@gmail.com; vallar@udc.es; rmnpslb@gmail.com";"Rosário, Pedro/A-1775-2011; Valle, Antonio/A-6776-2013; Núñez, José Carlos/H-4425-2013; Núñez, José Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Vallejo, Guillermo/B-8233-2011";"Rosário, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Valle, Antonio/0000-0001-8160-9181; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Núñez, José Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Vallejo, Guillermo/0000-0002-8010-6854";;;;78;8;8;1;38;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0256-2928;1878-5174;;EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC;Eur.

It assesses what PBL is, in terms of the range of definitions in use and in light of its origins in specific disciplines such as medicine. It considers experiences (if PBL from the standpoint of students, instructors and managers (e.g. deans), and asks how well stated this method of learning is for use in geography curricula, courses and assignments. It identifies some 'best practices in PBL', as well as some useful sources for those seeking to adopt PBL in geography. It concludes that PBL is not a teaching and learning method to be adopted lightly, and that if the chances of successful implementation are to be maximized, careful attention to course preparation and scenario design is essential. More needs to be known about the circumstances in which applications of PBL have not worked well and also about the nature of the inputs needed from students, teachers and others to real) its benefits.;"Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Christchurch, New Zealand; Samford Univ, Dept Geog, Birmingham, AL 35229 USA; Oxford Brookes Univ, Ctr Geog Higher Educ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; Univ La Serena, Fac Cs Sociales & Econ, La Serena, Chile; Univ Auckland, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Geol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada";;Pawson, E (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand.;eric.pawson@canterbury.ac.nz;;;;;;66;111;112;3;29;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0309-8265;1466-1845;;J GEOGR HIGHER EDUC;J.

The aim of the study is to characterise parental attitudes and styles of fathers of children with intellectual disabilities, and to analyse their relation to the children's adaptive behaviour. Method Eighty-three families (fathers and mothers) answered self-report questionnaires, which assessed parenting styles and attitudes, as well as an adaptive behaviour questionnaire about their children with intellectual disabilities between 4 and 18 years of age. Results Both parents have a tendency towards an authoritative style of parenting. Fathers (versus mothers) perceive greater parental support but are less involved in their children's lives. Among fathers, the authoritative style was a significant contributor to the child's adaptive behaviour, above and beyond the mother's contribution. Conclusions Studies about parenting should include both mothers and fathers, as paternal parenting styles and attitudes are related to children's adaptive behaviour.;"[Sabat, Camila; Arango, Paulina] Univ Los Andes, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Sabat, Camila; Arango, Paulina] Millenium Inst Caregiving Res MICARE, Santiago, Chile; [Burke, Meghan M.] Univ Illinois, Coll Educ, Champaign, IL USA";;"Arango, P (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.; Arango, P (corresponding author), Millenium Inst Caregiving Res MICARE, Santiago, Chile.";parango@uandes.cl;;"Sabat, Camila/0000-0003-3136-6796; Burke, Meghan/0000-0001-5287-2351; Arango, Paulina Sofia/0000-0002-9942-6997";"Fondo de Apoyo a la Investigacion de Area Tematica Prioritaria (FAI ATP) from Universidad de los Andes, Chile [INV-AT-2017-39]; ANID Millennium Science Initiative [ICS2019_024]";This work was funded by the Fondo de Apoyo a la Investigacion de Area Tematica Prioritaria (FAI ATP), grant number: INV-AT-2017-39, from Universidad de los Andes, Chile.

The software is integrated with two commercial finite element softwares. These are the Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) code in SAP2000 and the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) code in ANSYS. GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental knowledge for their future works as engineers. The present interactive virtual environment has great potential to improve the learning process of the analysis of silo structures.;"[Garcia-Macias, Enrique] Univ Perugia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Via G Duranti 93, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Castro-Triguero, Rafael] Univ Cordoba, Dept Mech, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba, Spain; [Saavedra Flores, Erick I.; Yanez, Sergio J.; Hinrechsen, Karen] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ingn Obras Civiles, Ave Ecuador 3659, Santiago 9160000, Chile";;Flores, EIS (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ingn Obras Civiles, Ave Ecuador 3659, Santiago 9160000, Chile.;erick.saavedra@usach.cl;"Yanez, Sergio/Q-7165-2019; García-Macías, Enrique/L-2005-2015; Triguero, Rafael Castro/N-5054-2019";"Yanez, Sergio/0000-0002-8856-0955; García-Macías, Enrique/0000-0001-5557-144X; Triguero, Rafael Castro/0000-0002-2937-1118";;;;35;2;2;1;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

A remarkable aspect is to define equating as a standard statistical inference problem in which the true equating transformation is the parameter of interest that has to be estimated and assessed as any standard evaluation of an estimator of an unknown parameter in statistics. We believe that putting equating methods in a general statistical model framework would be an interesting and useful next step in the area. van der Linden's conceptual article on equating is certainly an important contribution to this task.;"[Gonzalez B, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez B, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Measurement Ctr MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [von Davier, Matthias] Educ Testing Serv, Ctr Global Assessment, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA";;Gonzalez, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"jgonzale@mat.puc.cl; mvondavier@ets.org";González, Jorge/R-7652-2019;"von Davier, Matthias/0000-0003-1298-9701; Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795";;;;21;7;7;0;5;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-0655;;;J EDUC MEAS;J.

J;"Wiberg, M; Gonzalez, J";;;;"Wiberg, Marie; Gonzalez, Jorge";;;Statistical Assessment of Estimated Transformations in Observed-Score Equating;JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT;;;English;Article;;;;;;;BANDWIDTH-SELECTION;Equating methods make use of an appropriate transformation function to map the scores of one test form into the scale of another so that scores are comparable and can be used interchangeably. The equating literature shows that the ways of judging the success of an equating (i.e., the score transformation) might differ depending on the adopted framework. Rather than targeting different parts of the equating process and aiming to evaluate the process from different aspects, this article views the equating transformation as a standard statistical estimator and discusses how this estimator should be assessed in an equating framework. For the kernel equating framework, a numerical illustration shows the potentials of viewing the equating transformation as a statistical estimator as opposed to assessing it using equating-specific criteria. A discussion on how this approach can be used to compare other equating estimators from different frameworks is also included.;"[Wiberg, Marie] Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Fac Math, Casilla 306 Correo 22, Santiago, Chile";;"Wiberg, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.; Gonzalez, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Fac Math, Casilla 306 Correo 22, Santiago, Chile.";"marie.wiberg@umu.se; jorge.gonzalez@mat.uc.cl";"González, Jorge/R-7652-2019; Wiberg, Marie/X-2446-2019";"Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795; Wiberg, Marie/0000-0001-5549-8262";"Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2014-578]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150233]";The research in this article by Marie Wiberg was funded by the Swedish Research Council grant 2014-578.

It defines a family of true transformations that aim at the ideal of equitable equating. van der Linden (this issue) offers a detailed discussion of common issues in observed-score equating relative to this local approach. By assuming an underlying item response theory model, one of the main features of LE is that it adjusts the equated raw scores using conditional distributions of raw scores given an estimate of the ability of interest. In this article, we argue that this feature disappears when using a Rasch model for the estimation of the true transformation, while the one-parameter logistic model and the two-parameter logistic model do provide a local adjustment of the equated score.;"[von Davier, Matthias] Educ Testing Serv, Ctr Global Assessment, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA; [Gonzalez B, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez B, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Measurement Ctr MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [von Davier, Alina A.] Educ Testing Serv, Ctr Adv Psychometr, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA";;von Davier, M (corresponding author), Educ Testing Serv, Ctr Global Assessment, MS-13E, Princeton, NJ 08541 USA.;"mvondavier@ets.org; jgonzale@mat.puc.cl; avondavier@ets.org";González, Jorge/R-7652-2019;"von Davier, Matthias/0000-0003-1298-9701; Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795";;;;14;3;3;0;25;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-0655;;;J EDUC MEAS;J.

In this sense, we will suggest that students' teleological views can be used as the starting point for the construction of knowledge in this area of biology. To establish possible didactic strategies, we will turn to the way Darwin himself dealt with the teleology of former naturalists: Darwin had to modify several aspects of the previous teleological thinking: He had to reform functional biology. We will develop an alternative approach to teleology problem by conceiving of the contemporary student as a pre-Darwinian teleologist. Working from there, we will sketch two possible approaches for dealing with the students' teleological thinking. The first approach seeks to modify the students' intuitive functional biology in order to bring it closer to the modified functional biology developed by Darwin but avoiding the use of notions from evolutionary biology. The second approach involves using theory of natural selection as a guide to reformulate the functional biology of the students.;"[Ginnobili, Santiago; Ariza, Yefrin] Univ Nacl Quilmes UNQ, Ctr Estudios Filosofia & Hist Ciencia CEFHIC, Bernal, Argentina; [Ginnobili, Santiago; Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo] Univ Buenos Aires UBA, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Invest CeFIEC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ariza, Yefrin] Univ Catolica Maule UCM, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Dept Biol & Quim, Talca, Chile";;"Ariza, Y (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Quilmes UNQ, Ctr Estudios Filosofia & Hist Ciencia CEFHIC, Bernal, Argentina.; Ariza, Y (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule UCM, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Dept Biol & Quim, Talca, Chile.";"santi75@gmail.com; leomgalli@gmail.com; angelyefrin@hotmail.com";"; Ariza, Yefrin/Y-6115-2018";"Ginnobili, Santiago/0000-0001-5375-965X; Ariza, Yefrin/0000-0002-1993-7245; Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo/0000-0002-0713-164X";"Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina [0990/19]; Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero, Argentina [32/19 80120190100217TF]; ANPCyT, ArgentinaANPCyT [PICT-2014-1741, PICT-2014-03454]; UBACyT (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina)University of Buenos Aires [20020190201537BA, 20020190200085BA]";This work has been funded by the following research projects: PUNQ, 0990/19 (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina), UNTREF 32/19 80120190100217TF (Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero, Argentina), PICT-2014-1741 (ANPCyT, Argentina), PICT-2014-03454 (ANPCyT, Argentina), and UBACyT 20020190201537BA, 20020190200085BA (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina).;;103;0;0;1;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0926-7220;1573-1901;;SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS;Sci.

However, the lack of valid and reliable instruments to estimate social accountability has limited the possibility of measuring the impact that medical schools have in society. Our aim was to develop an instrument and validate its use for assessing social accountability in Latin American countries. Methods:We used a three-phase mixed methods research design to develop, validate and estimate social accountability in a diverse convenient sample of 49 medical schools from 16 Latin American countries. We used a qualitative framework approach and a Delphi consensus method to design an instrument with high content validity. Finally, we assessed the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results:The Social Accountability Instrument for Latin America (SAIL)contained 21 items in four domains: mission and quality improvement, public policy, community engagement, and professional integrity. Its reliability index, estimated using Cronbach's alpha, was very high (0.96). Most of the medical schools that had ranked over the 80th percentile on traditional national academic estimates did not reach the 80th percentile using SAIL. Conclusions:There are validity arguments (content and reliability) to support the measurement of social accountability using the SAIL instrument. Its application showed that it provides a complementary dimension to that traditionally obtained when estimating quality in medical schools.;"[Puschel, Klaus; Sapag, Jaime; Moore, Philippa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Family Med, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo; Diaz, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo; Fuentes-Lopez, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hlth Sci, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna Ave, Santiago, Chile; [de la Jara, Jorge Jimenez] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Publ Hlth, Santiago, Chile; [Burdick, William; Norcini, John] Fdn Adv Int Med Educ & Res, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Burdick, William] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Campos, Henry] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Valdez, Jorge E.] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Med, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Llosa, Maria Paola] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Sch Med, Lima, Peru; [Lamus-Lemus, Francisco] Univ La Sabana, Dept Med Educ, Cundinamarca, Colombia; [Yulitta, Horacio] Argentinean Paediat Soc, Evaluat Profess Board, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Grez, Marcela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile";;Riquelme, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hlth Sci, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna Ave, Santiago, Chile.;a.riquelme.perez@gmail.com;Yulitta, Horacio/ABF-8296-2021;"Diaz, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-8540-4930; MOORE, PHILIPPA/0000-0002-3578-7240";School of Medicine Pontificia Universidad Cat~olica de Chile [14-518];This work was supported by School of Medicine Pontificia Universidad Cat~olica de Chile [Grant funding 14-518].;;33;3;3;0;5;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-159X;1466-187X;;MED TEACH;Med.

However, we still do not know many specific details regarding how students and teachers learn particular aspects of NOS and what are the most important feature traits of instruction. In this context, the main objective of this review is to analyze articles from nine main science education journals that consider the teaching of NOS to K-12 students, pre-service, and in-service science teachers in search of patterns in teaching and learning NOS. After reviewing 52 studies in nine journals that included data regarding participants' views of NOS before and after an intervention, the main findings were as follows: (1) some aspects of NOS (empirical basis, observation and inference, and creativity) are easier to learn than others (tentativeness, theory and law, and social and cultural embeddedness), and subjective aspects of NOS and the scientific method seemed to be difficult for participants to understand; (2) the interventions most frequently lasted 5 to 8weeks for students, one semester for pre-service teachers, and 1year for experienced teachers; and (3) most of the interventions incorporated both decontextualized and contextualized activities. Given the substantial diversity in the methods and intervention designs used and the variables studied, it was not possible to infer a pattern of more-effective NOS teaching strategies from the reviewed studies. Future investigation should focus on (a) disentangling whether a difference exists between the easy and difficult aspects of learning NOS and formulating a theoretical explanation for distinguishing the two types of aspects and (b) assessing the effectiveness of different kinds of courses (e.g., history of science, NOS or informal) and strategies (e.g., hands-on vs. drama activities; SSI vs. HOS).";"[Cofre, Hernan; Nunez, Paola] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Cofre, Hernan; Nunez, Paola; Valencia, Martina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Didact Ciencias Expt, Valparaiso, Chile; [Santibanez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pavez, Jose M.] Univ Georgia, Coll Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Vergara, Claudia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile";;"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.; Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Didact Ciencias Expt, Valparaiso, Chile.";hernan.cofre@pucv.cl;;"Valencia, Martina/0000-0002-8144-5882; Pavez, Jose/0000-0002-4946-5496";;;;97;22;24;8;63;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0926-7220;1573-1901;;SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS;Sci.

Higher Education institutions need their students to have basic understandings of the subjects to be imparted in the first semesters, but since they come with different backgrounds and prior knowledge, this is not always possible and many students struggle in their first courses. This paper presents the results of students' adoption and learning outcomes of using four MOOCs as a complementary study resource for an on-campus calculus diagnostic exam. Over 700 newly admitted university students had to take a mandatory diagnostic exam on four calculus topics before classes started. MOOCs were proposed as a voluntary support for studying these subjects. Following a mixed method analysis, we studied why and when the students used the online courses and we also measured the effects of its use in terms of the students' diagnostic exam grades and learning outcomes. The results show that students mostly used the MOOCs to study the subjects that were not covered in their secondary studies. Students who were active in these course topics obtained better scores, having more chances of passing the diagnostic exam than students who did not study with the MOOCs. Furthermore, students not only used the MOOCs for studying for the exam, but also for refreshing concepts for future courses.;"[Hernandez, Josefina; Rodriguez, Fernanda; Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 486, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Tolouse III Paul Sabatier, IRIT, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, Tolouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";;Hernandez, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 486, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile.;"jmherna1@uc.cl; mfrodri3@uc.cl; ihillige@ing.puc.cl; mar.perez@uc.cl";"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; HERNANDEZ, JOSEFINA/0000-0002-2422-3634";"Proyecto de Iniciacio_n Fondecyt [11150231]; Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy [14EN12-26862]; Erasmusp Programme of the European Union, MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]";This work was been supported in part by the Proyecto de Iniciacio_n Fondecyt under Grant 2015 No. 11150231, in part by the Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy under Grant 14EN12-26862, and in part by the Erasmusp Programme of the European Union, MOOC-Maker under Grant 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.t;;28;3;3;0;19;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Recommendations by healthcare providers, family and friends have been associated with early detection strategies among US-based Latina populations, but little is known about other Latin American populations. Furthermore, less is known about mechanisms underlying this relationship. In this study, we sought to (i) understand if different types of recommendations were associated with subsequent plans to obtain a mammogram and (ii) assess the potential mediating roles of perceived importance of these recommendations and self-efficacy. Our sample included 250 women residing in a low-income, urban area of Santiago, Chile, and who had participated in a 6-month intervention to increase mammography screening, but remained noncompliant. Women who received family recommendations were more likely to indicate they planned to receive a mammogram in the next 6 months. Perceived self-efficacy mediated this relationship, such that women who received a family recommendation appeared to be more likely to plan to get a mammogram because of increased perceived capabilities to do so. Future research should consider the cultural context of family and self-efficacy in the development of screening interventions for Latinas.;"[Molina, Yamile; Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera; Thompson, Beti] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Canc Prevent Program, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Molina, Yamile] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL USA; [Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera; Pueschel, Klaus] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Family & Community Med, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Thompson, Beti] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA";;Molina, Y (corresponding author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Canc Prevent Program, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.;ymolina@fhcrc.org;Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera/ABC-3719-2021;Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera/0000-0002-2493-9974;"FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R03 TW007900] Funding Source: Medline; NCI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA148143, P50 CA148143, U54 CA153502] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R03TW007900] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA148143, U54CA153502] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";;;38;16;16;0;8;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1153;1465-3648;;HEALTH EDUC RES;Health Educ.

This is partially due to the lack of any assessment instrument to measure understandings about scientific inquiry. However, a valid and reliable assessment has recently been developed and published, Views About Scientific Inquiry (VASI; Lederman et al. [2014], Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51, 65-83). The purpose of this large-scale international project was to collect the first baseline data on what beginning middle school students have learned about scientific inquiry during their elementary school years. Eighteen countries/regions spanning six continents including 2,634 students participated in the study. The participating countries/regions were: Australia, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Mainland China, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. In many countries, science is not formally taught until middle school, which is the rationale for choosing seventh grade students for this investigation. This baseline data will simultaneously provide information on what, if anything, students learn about inquiry in elementary school, as well as their beginning knowledge as they enter secondary school. It is important to note that collecting data from all of the approximately 200 countries globally was not humanly possible, and it was also not possible to collect data from every region of each country. The results overwhelmingly show that students around the world at the beginning of grade seven have very little understandings about scientific inquiry. Some countries do show reasonable understandings in certain aspects but the overall picture of understandings of scientific inquiry is not what is hoped for after completing 6 years of elementary education in any country.";"[Lederman, Judith; Lederman, Norman; Jimenez, Juan] IIT, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Bartels, Selina] Valparaiso Univ, Dept Educ, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA; [Akubo, Mark] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Aly, Shereen; EL-Deghaidy, Heba; ElZorkani, Ahmed] Amer Univ Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt; [Bao, Chengcheng; Lv, Bin; Wei, Fangbing; Wu, Zhifeng; Xiao, Huang] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Jinhua, Peoples R China; [Blanquet, Estelle] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; [Blanquet, Estelle] ESPE dAquitaine, Merignac, France; [Blonder, Ron] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [Soares de Andrade, Mariana Bologna] Univ Estadual Londrina, Londrina, Brazil; [Buntting, Catherine; Hume, Anne; Saunders, Kathy] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Cakir, Mustafa; Han-Tosunoglu, Cigdem; Irez, Serhat; Kivilcan Dogan, Ozgur] Marmara Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gaigher, Estelle] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Guo, Shuchen; Liu, Cheng; Liu, Enshan] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hakanen, Arvi; Lavonen, Jari] Helsingin Yliopisto, Helsinki, Finland; [Hamed Al-Lal, Soraya; Rivero Garcia, Ana] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Hattingh, Annemarie; Kay, Gillian] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Kremer, Kerstin; Neumann, Irene; Voitle, Frauke] IPN, Kiel, Germany; [Kuo, Pi-Chu] Natl Pingtung Univ, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Lin, Shu-Fen] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Changhua, Taiwan; [Liu, Shiang-Yao] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Mamlok-Naaman, Rachel] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [McDonald, Christine] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Pan, Yaozhen] Zhejiang Int Studies Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Picholle, Eric] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; [Rundgren, Carl-Johan; von Gyllenpalm, Jakob] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Santibanez-Gomez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile; [Schwartz, Renee] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Wishart, Jocelyn] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Yalaki, Yalcin] Hacettepe Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Zhou, Qiaoxue] Shanghai Jingyang Middle Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China";;Lederman, J (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.;ledermanj@iit.edu;"bartels, selina/AAK-9801-2020; Han-Tosunoglu, Cigdem/AAA-3583-2019; Yalaki, Yalcin/F-8639-2011; Schwartz, Renee S/Z-1610-2019; Dogan, Ozgur Kivilcan/G-2550-2013; Rivero, Ana AR/S-7384-2016; Akubo, Mark/AAF-5889-2019; Hume, Anne/H-9601-2013; irez, serhat/AAA-7473-2019; XIAO, HUANG/AAK-4252-2020; Kremer, Kerstin/AAA-9037-2020; Buntting, Cathy/AAI-1110-2020";"Yalaki, Yalcin/0000-0003-0939-4766; Dogan, Ozgur Kivilcan/0000-0002-3213-2345; Rivero, Ana AR/0000-0002-3130-6905; Hume, Anne/0000-0002-9565-8045; irez, serhat/0000-0003-3294-4666; Kremer, Kerstin/0000-0003-2305-3650; Lederman, Judith/0000-0002-0515-9913; Lin, Shu-Fen/0000-0002-4037-4846; Buntting, Cathy/0000-0002-1507-9415; Han Tosunoglu, Cigdem/0000-0002-5904-656X; Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953; Lederman, Norman/0000-0003-0957-3887; Wishart, Jocelyn/0000-0002-8593-3728";;;;71;23;24;3;134;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-4308;1098-2736;;J RES SCI TEACH;J.

The aim was to identify cultural factors relevant to breast and cervical cancer screening, develop an instrument to assess them and examine its preliminary psychometric properties among Latin American (Latino) and non-Latino White (Anglo) women in Southern California. Seventy-eight Latino and Anglo women participated in semi-structured interviews, which were content coded based on Triandis' methods for the analysis of subjective culture. Based on the emerging cultural elements, items relevant to cancer screening were developed and pilot tested with 161 participants. After the instrument was refined, 314 Latino and Anglo women from various socioeconomic backgrounds completed the CCSS and data were factor analyzed resulting in five cultural factors: cancer screening fatalism, negative beliefs about health professionals, catastrophic disease expectations, symptomatic deterrents and sociocultural deterrents. The instrument demonstrated measurement equivalence, adequate reliability and predictive validity. The research and the CCSS are discussed in terms of implications for the study of culture in relation to health disparities and the development of evidence-based interventions with culturally diverse populations and their health professionals.;"[Betancourt, Hector; Flynn, Patricia M.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA; [Betancourt, Hector] Univ La Frontera, Dept Psychol, Temuco, Chile; [Riggs, Matt] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Psychol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Garberoglio, Carlos] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Dept Gen & Oncol Surg, Duarte, CA 91010 USA";;Betancourt, H (corresponding author), Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA.;hbetancourt@llu.edu;;;NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R21CA101867] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER;;;48;36;41;0;11;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1153;1465-3648;;HEALTH EDUC RES;Health Educ.

This article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology teachers' understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training. Teachers' views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews, and in the second session we collected information about teachers' perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers' understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated NOS.

Often, developers (generally, educators who know the subjects they teach but lack of the technical and programming skills required to build Internet-based educational applications) end up discarding the idea of exploring these new teaching and learning experiences mainly due to the technical issues that must be mastered. To tackle this problem, authors present a novel technique that allows developers to create remote labs in a quick, didactical, and straightforward way. This framework is based on the use of two well-known software tools in the scope of engineering education, Easy Java Simulations and LabVIEW. The development exploits a new feature of Easy Java Simulations known as EJS-elements that enables Java developers to create and integrate their own authoring libraries (elements) into EJS, thus increasing its application possibilities. Particularly, the EJS element here presented allows to LabVIEW programs be controlled from EJS applications through a communication network. This paper presents the element creation details and how this can be used to create web-enabled experimentation environments for educational purposes. A step by step example of development of a remote lab for automatic control education is described.;"[Chacon, Jesus; Sanchez, Jose; Dormido, Sebastian] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Informat & Automat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Vargas, Hector; Farias, Gonzalo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Chacon, J (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Dept Informat & Automat, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.;"jchacon@bec.uned.es; hector.vargas@ucv.cl; gonzalo.farias@ucv.cl; jsanchez@dia.uned.es; sdormido@dia.uned.es";"Bencomo, Sebastian Dormido/K-6918-2014; Sánchez-Moreno, José/K-8662-2014; Chacon Sombria, Jesus/K-7925-2014";"Bencomo, Sebastian Dormido/0000-0002-2405-8771; Sánchez-Moreno, José/0000-0002-6702-3771; Chacon Sombria, Jesus/0000-0003-0898-3462";"Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [DPI2011-27818-C02-02, DPI2012-31303]; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission; Chilean National Commission for Research, Science and Technology (CONICYT) through Fondecyt Initiation ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121437]";This work has been funded by the National Plan Projects DPI2011-27818-C02-02 and DPI2012-31303 of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER funds.

However, engineering mobile learning applications for outdoor usage poses severe challenges. The requirements of these applications are challenging, as many different aspects need to be catered, such as resource access and sharing, communication between peers, group management, activity flow, etc. Robustness is particularly important for learning scenarios to guarantee undisturbed and smooth user experiences, pushing the technological aspects in the background. Despite significant research in the field of mobile learning, very few efforts have focused on collaborative mobile learning requirements from a software engineering perspective. This paper focuses on aspects of the software architecture, aiming to address the challenges related to resource sharing in collaborative mobile learning activities. This includes elements such as autonomy for personal interactive learning, richness for large group collaborative learning (indoor and outdoor), as well as robustness of the learning system. Additionally, we present self-adaptation as a solution to mitigate risks of resource unavailability and organization failures that arise from environment and system dynamism. Our evaluation provides indications regarding the system correctness with respect to resource sharing and collaboration concerns, and offers qualitative evidence of self-adaptation benefits for collaborative mobile learning applications.;"[de la Iglesia, Didac Gil] Linnaeus Univ, Media Technol, Kronoberg, Sweden; [Felipe Calderon, Juan; Nussbaum, Miguel] Escuela Ingn PUC, Dept Ciencia Computac, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Weyns, Danny] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Vaxjo, Smaland, Sweden; [Milrad, Marcelo] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Learning & Knowledge Technol CeLeKT, S-35195 Vaxjo, Kronoberg, Sweden";;de la Iglesia, DG (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Media Technol, Kronoberg, Sweden.;"didac.gil-de-la-iglesia@lnu.se; jfcalder@ing.puc.cl; danny.weyns@lnu.se; marcelo.milrad@lnu.se; mn@ing.puc.cl";"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Weyns, Danny/J-1267-2018";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Weyns, Danny/0000-0002-1162-0817";Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [CIE01-CONICYT];This work was supported by Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [Grant CIE01-CONICYT].;;45;12;12;1;41;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Evidence from seventh-grade students;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Working memory; Visuo-spatial skills; Computer use; Video games; Digital divide; Chile";"VIDEO GAME; FIELD-DEPENDENCE; INTERNET; GENDER; SKILLS; CAPACITY";"The main purpose of this study was to assess whether seventh-grade students use of information and communication technology (ICT) was related to performance on working memory tasks. In addition, the study tested whether the relationship between ICT use and performance on working memory tasks interacted with seventh-grade students' socioeconomic level and gender. 275 students recruited from 30 Chilean schools were grouped according to their self-reported use of PC, the Internet, Chat and Video games. To assess students' working memory performance, they were tested with a digit span test and a visuo-spatial measure. Only one of our two dependent variables reflected a relationship between specific profiles of ICT use and working memory. Higher scores on the digits span test were related to those user profiles combining PC use and video game play, that is, those identified as Full users and as PC and Console Garners. We did not find an interaction effect of gender and ICT use or an interaction effect of socioeconomic level and ICT use. There are three possible explanations for these results: first, a proclivity of students with higher working memory capacity to engage in technology use; second, an impact on working memory of potential differences in multitasking; and, third, an impact on working memory of video game play. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously since scores on the GEFT, our visuo-spatial working memory measure, were not related to any profile of technology use. As serious educational games become more regularly used at school, previous differences in video game experience become growingly important. Future research must study whether the intended benefits of serious educational games are being mediated by individual differences in previous exposure to video games and other information and computer technologies, with independence of the directionality of the relationship between video game play and working memory.

The design of this kind of game, however, is a complex process that must consider instruction strategies, methodology, usability and ludic aspects. This article's aim is to develop and systematize guidelines for the design of CMPGs. To develop these guidelines we used a three-step process: evaluating an initial implementation of a CMPG and finding its problems; defining guidelines that can help overcome these problems; and redesigning the game based on the guidelines before testing it in a real class scenario to assess how helpful the guidelines were in solving the initial problems. From the initial evaluation of the game, we developed a series of guidelines to overcome the existing problems that can be classified into six categories: On-screen information, Game mechanics, Game progression, Methodology, Collaboration, and Holism. After redesigning the game with these guidelines we performed a field study to see the behavior of the new CMPG, where we measured how well the guidelines were applied in the game-play and the effectiveness in regard to the learning level reached by the students. Our results indicate that the guidelines are a valuable tool in the design of CMPGs that foster learning, which was shown both in the results of the observations and in the significant increase in learning. Although the design guidelines can be seen as general principles, we conclude that they have to be considered differently for different games, and that even during a specific game the importance of each guideline may vary throughout the different quests.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is philosophical, conceptual and theoretical and in proffering a bold thesis, has an argumentative character appropriate to that style. Findings Three stages can be identified over the past 200 years in the relationship between the university and the matter of social responsibility, being successively tacit, weak and now hybrid. In the present stage, new spaces are opening for the university to transcend social responsibility, moving to a worldly and earthly responsibility. However, this new stage is having to contend against the university in an age of cognitive capitalism. As such, a large but hitherto unnoticed culture war is present, the outcome of which is unclear. Research limitations/implications The scholarship informing this paper is wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary (history, social theory, philosophy, critical higher education studies, literature on the idea of the university, comparative higher education, ethics and sociology of knowledge), as it has to be in sustaining the large thesis being contended for, and it has broad hinterlands, which can only lightly be intimated. Practical implications The key implication is that the idea of social responsibility is currently being construed too narrowly and that, therefore, universities - in developing their corporate strategies and missions - should be more ambitious and set their responsibility goals against horizons that go well beyond the social realm. Originality/value The thesis developed here is original in offering a three-stage theory of a 200-year evolution of the socially responsible European university. A new stage of an Earthly responsibility is glimpsed but it is having to contend with a continuing performative university, so leading to a hidden culture war and such that the future of university social responsibility is in doubt.;"[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile";;Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, London, England.;"ron.barnett@ucl.ac.uk; carolina.guzman.uta@gmail.com";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;Fondecyt projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1200633];This work was supported by Fondecyt project 1200633.;;57;1;1;1;3;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1467-6370;1758-6739;;INT J SUST HIGHER ED;Int.

Method: Participants completed an online survey in fall 2012 that assessed childhood bullying victimization and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: Students reporting childhood bullying victimization who indicated they were unable to defend themselves had greater symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who reported victimization but indicated they were able to defend themselves. Qualitative analyses explored why students perceived they could not defend themselves, including factors related to themselves and aggressors. Conclusion: For college students, feeling unable to defend oneself during childhood bullying victimization may be a focus for intervention and help explain diverse college outcomes associated with bullying victimization.;"[Oblath, Rachel; Guzman, Javier; Holt, Melissa] Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Counseling Psychol & Appl Human Dev, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Green, Jennifer Greif] Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Teaching & Learning, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Guzman, Javier] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Concepcion, Chile; [Felix, Erika D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Counseling Clin & Sch Psychol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Furlong, Michael J.; Sharkey, Jill] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Int Ctr Sch Based Youth Dev, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";;Green, JG (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, 2 Silber Way, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;jggreen@bu.edu;Sharkey, Jill/AAE-7017-2020;"Green, Jennifer/0000-0002-3541-4989; Furlong, Michael/0000-0001-5011-4565";;;;51;4;4;3;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0744-8481;1940-3208;;J AM COLL HEALTH;J.

However, current SLEs have two limitations: (1) not all of these characteristics are included, particularly lacking collaborative knowledge construction, in most cases; and (2) most SLEs are designed to support learning activities outdoors, but not indoors. This paper presents the implementation of an SLE that overcomes these two limitations. This SLE is based on bidirectional Quick Response (QR) codes, which are enhanced QR codes that not only provide information when scanned but also collect usergenerated content. This Bidirectional SLE is evaluated in an experiment in which it is compared with an equivalent Traditional SLE, which is built upon traditional QR codes. The purpose of this comparison is to understand if using bidirectional QR codes as a mechanism to support collaborative knowledge construction in indoor settings has an impact on students' learning outcomes and on their impression of the learning experience. Two hundred fifty-three students participated in this experiment. Data collected from this experiment indicate that the students who worked in the Bidirectional SLE (1) received better scores, providing better and more complete answers, and (2) evaluated their learning experience better than their peers' who worked in the Traditional SLE. Finally, a cross-analysis of these results including teachers' opinions led to a set of lessons learned about the design of SLEs to support collaborative knowledge construction.

Both of them provide their students with e-learning platforms. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions are the tools used to measure the acceptance and use of web-based learning platforms and cultural diversity of respondents, respectively. In summary, we can affirm that the sample of tertiary Spanish and Chilean students are culturally different with regard to some of Hofstede's dimensions, but their behavior of acceptance of e-learning technology globally matches according to the TAM model.

We conjectured that these two different emphases could be fruitful combined in a research and development process aimed at producing effective CSCL practices. We explored this possibility in a project that adapted a CSCL tool from Chile to serve as the basis of an effective 3-week classroom module for primary school mathematics in the United States. To go from tool to module, we addressed curricular fit, training materials, pedagogical guidance, formative and summative assessments, and logistical support. In conducting the project, we found that effectiveness and contextual research could be conducted simultaneously and yielded complementary insight to this design process, which enabled our project to rapidly move from the base tool towards complete classroom modules. An experiment we conducted after our design iterations showed that students who used the modules learned more about the target content, fractions.

Different theoretical frameworks and assessment instruments have emerged for measuring this skill. However, more applied studies on its implementation and evaluation in real-life educational settings are required. In this sense, pre-post experimental designs are essential for identifying new methods for developing collaborative problem-solving skills. To do so, equivalent tests are needed to facilitate consistent score interpretations and reduce the practice effect. In the present study, a Design-Based Research approach is used to design and validate an assessment tool with two equivalent forms based on a framework proposed by the OECD and applied to a collaborative activity. A total of 719 students aged between 10 and 13 years old participated in the different stages of the study. The results show that the proposed instrument effectively measures the problem-solving dimension of collaborative problem-solving skills among students of this age. Moreover, the results from the test were equivalent for both forms and across genders. Finally, there were no significant differences when assessing collaborative problem-solving in human-human groups versus human-agent groups using the proposed instrument. For future work, we recommend including other data sources than just text-based conversations. This would allow us to capture the rich social interactions present in this type of activity. Future work should also consider exploring the extent to which skills could be trained. This could be done in an experimental design assessed using the equivalent forms of the proposed instrument as a pre- and post-test. Doing so would provide a more accurate measure of students' collaborative skills.;"[Rojas, Matias; Nussbaum, Miguel; Guerrero, Orlando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Santiago, Chile; [Greiff, Samuel; Krieger, Florian; Westhuizen, Lindie Van Der] Univ Luxembourg, Cognit Sci & Assessment, 2 Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg";;Rojas, M (corresponding author), Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;mirojas1@uc.cl;;"van der Westhuizen, Lindie/0000-0003-1906-1965; Rojas, Matias/0000-0002-9055-4167; Greiff, Samuel/0000-0003-2900-3734";FONDECYT/CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [FONDECYT 1180024];This work was supported by FONDECYT/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1180024].;;83;1;1;34;34;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Data used is from the PISA 2009 test. Special attention is given to potential bias problems when the computer use is an endogenous variable. Few studies in this area address this issue: existing literature has shown that different types of computer use have different implications on performance. The limitations of observational data have also been emphasized to establish cause-effect relations between computer use and academic performance. It is important, however, to consider the computer use endogeneity hypothesis (above all at home) since students decide on the frequency of computer use at home. The results found show that by controlling for endogeneity, computer use for reading is not related to reading performance neither in digital or printed format, with the exception of Chile that shows a negative relation in the case of reading from a printed format. The results considering endogeneity differ considerably from results when endogeneity is not taken into account. The work shows the relevance of experimental type studies in order to make sound statements with regard to the computer use and academic performance relation. In turn, school reading activities in a digital environment are suggested that could have an impact on reading performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants: A sample of 4,710 university students responded anonymously to an online questionnaire. Methods: The risk and protective factors assessed were: specific COVID-related functional difficulties, levels of social support, and trust in the university authorities and the government in handling the crisis. Results: The most frequent COVID-19 related difficulties were: worry for the health of family members (64.4%) and difficulties with online learning (63.2%). Almost half of the students (47.3%) reported that they needed at least a little help. Hierarchical regression analyses for coping and need for help showed that COVID-related difficulties predicted lower levels of perceived coping and a higher need for help. Conclusions: Universities need to build specific services for students to provide concrete support throughout this continuous health crisis.;"[Schiff, Miriam; Pat-Horenczyk, Ruth; Benbenishty, Rami] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Paul Baerwald Sch Social Work & Social Welf, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Benbenishty, Rami] Andres Bello Natl Univ, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Schiff, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Paul Baerwald Sch Social Work & Social Welf, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.;Miriam.schiff@mail.huji.ac.il;;;;;;54;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0744-8481;1940-3208;;J AM COLL HEALTH;J.

The central hypothesis of this work is that students attending schools with high digital development have higher levels of subjective well-being. To test this hypothesis, two quantitative empirical studies carried out in Chile are used as sources of information. The first one is the 2013 National Survey of School Well-being, applied to 15-year-old students (4964 cases) from 191 schools, and the second one is the 2012 National Census of Educational Computing. Subsequently, after both sources are merged, a descriptive analysis and an explanatory model are created based on the dependent variable Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and the independent variables School Digital Development Index (SDDI) and attributes of establishment and subjects.

Sixth-grade students selected from four schools located in Santiago, Chile read a two-paragraph text on a computer screen and were asked either to read it (read-only group), highlight text as they read (highlighting group), type notes from the text into a textbox as they read (notetaking group), fill in an interactive graphic organizer (graphic organizer group), highlight first and then take notes from the text (highlighting + notetaking group) or highlight first and then fill in an interactive graphic organizer (highlighting + graphic organizer group). The graphic organizer group, highlighting + graphic organizer group, and highlighting + notetaking group each made significantly more integrative eye movements between the two paragraphs during learning (indicating better learning processes) and produced higher comprehension test scores (indicating better learning outcomes) as compared to the read-only group, whereas the highlighting group and notetaking group did not. Results are consistent with the idea that filling in graphic organizers is a generative learning strategy, whereas highlighting and typing notes into a textbox are not generative learning strategies. Similarly using two learning strategies together (notetaking and highlighting) leads to generative learning even though using either one of those strategies alone does not, so in this case two learning strategies are better than one.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Soledad Loyola, Maria; Mendez, Ester E.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Lab Tecnol Interact, VirtuaLab, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Ingn Ind, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.;"hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; maria.loyola.f@usach.cl; mario.lopez@usach.cl; ester.mendez@usach.cl";Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";"CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT [1151092]; Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile";This study was partially funded by CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT #1151092 and Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile.;;41;10;10;7;50;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Collboard encompasses successive individual and collaborative work phases that prompt active student participation and engagement. It integrates digitally augmented appliances, namely, digital pens as a means to support individual work, and interactive whiteboards as a collaborative knowledge construction space. We report on the conceptual design of Collboard, its different technological and software components, as well as our findings from experiences we conducted in a Swedish school with 12 students from a 7th grade maths class. Findings from the experience provide an indication that Collboard can be well integrated in classroom teaching, and that it can foster the development of collective intelligence, distributed cognition and transmedia navigation in different knowledge domains.

This epistemic relativism is widespread nowadays and is arguably dangerous for our collective future, as the threat of climate change and its denialism clearly shows. In this work, we argue that even though the social character of science is indeed real, it does not entail epistemic relativism with respect to scientific knowledge, but quite the opposite, as there are several characteristic behaviours of this specific human community that were built to increase the reliability of scientific outputs. Crucially, we believe that present-day scientific education is lacking in the description and analysis of these particularities of the scientific community as a social group and that further investing in this area could greatly improve the possibilities of critical analysis of the often very technical issues that the citizens and future citizens of our modern societies have to confront.;"[Fernandez, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Benitez, Federico] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Romero-Maltrana, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile";;Fernandez, N (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;"natalia.fdez.f@gmail.com; federico.benitez.conte@gmail.com; diego.romero@pucv.cl";Benitez, Federico/I-4333-2013;Benitez, Federico/0000-0001-7978-970X;Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [039.374/2001];This study was partially funded by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, Grant No 039.374/2001.;;78;1;1;7;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0926-7220;1573-1901;;SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS;Sci.

We examined whether the current allocation of time to physical activity among young people leads to outcomes that may affect their well being as youth and their longer-term life prospects. Design: The study group comprised a random sample of 1692 high-school students (14.8 +/- 0.7 years old) from urban Santiago, Chile attending private and non-private schools. Setting: We measured physical activity habits accounting for time spent in class, studying and screen-based entertainment, hours of daily recreational activity and hours of weekly scheduled exercise. Obesity and abdominal obesity were diagnosed according to CDC/NCHS 2000, NHANES III and IDF criteria, respectively. Method: Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between current physical activity habits, confounders and the likelihood of suffering from obesity and abdominal obesity. Results: Young people reporting the lowest allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play showed a higher risk of obesity and abdominal obesity. Those reporting moderate allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play were more likely to suffer from central obesity as defined by IDF criteria. Study participants attending partially subsidized schools showed the highest risk of obesity and central obesity. Conclusions: In this sample, young people appear not to be employing optimal strategies for making weight-related choices, since reduced physical activity, obesity and central obesity are proximate causes of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.;"[Correa-Burrows, Paulina] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ Publ Finance 2, Madrid, Spain; [Burrows, Raquel A.] Univ Chile, Inst Nutr & Food Technol, Santiago, Chile";;Correa-Burrows, P (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ URJC, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Vicalvaro,P Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.;paulina.correa.burrows@urjc.es;"Burrows, Raquel/A-8489-2015; Burrows, Raquel/AAF-5660-2019; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/O-7436-2014";"Burrows, Raquel/0000-0001-9155-0689; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/0000-0002-6177-1162";;;;26;2;2;0;12;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0017-8969;1748-8176;;HEALTH EDUC J;Health Educ.

Subsequent to an earlier study of Chilean mothers' attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and adolescent sexual health and education, we conducted a study of fathers' attitudes. Fathers with children aged 9-19 years were recruited at an outpatient clinic in Linares, Chile. Thirty semi-structured face to face interviews were analysed using Grounded Theory methodology. Fathers overall lacked knowledge about HPV and the vaccine. With regards to sex education at home, three salient themes centred on the fathers being part of a 'transition generation.' While fathers expressed positive attitudes towards sex education at home and sought to have more open conversations with their children than they had with their own parents, stereotypical gender roles were barriers to putting these desires into action. Future regional and national sexual health initiatives should engage with gender equity policy change and equip fathers to engage in open, non-judgemental conversation with their children about sex and sexuality.;"[Muresianu, Emma Satterthwaite; Weinstock, Rachel E.; Arams, Ryan; Vorawandthanachai, Thammatat; Ferrera, Alexander; Forero, Juan Pablo] Albert Einstein Coll Med AECOM, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Arams, Ryan] Ventura Cty Med Ctr, Family Med Residency, Ventura, CA USA; [Maita, Yumarlin Torres] Univ Autonoma Chile, Hosp Linares, Dept Child & Adolescent Obstet & Gynaecol, Talca, Chile; [Dolan, Siobhan M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Obstet Gynaecol & Reprod Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA";;Muresianu, ES (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med AECOM, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.;esattert@mail.einstein.yu.edu;;Forero, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-2524-332X;"Global Health Fellowship Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Kuperman International Health Endowment Fund at Albert Einstein College of Medicine";Medical student researchers received travel funding to conduct the interviews from The Global Health Fellowship Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and The Kuperman International Health Endowment Fund at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.;;34;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1468-1811;1472-0825;;SEX EDUC-SEX SOC LEA;Sex Educ.-Sex.

In this article, we propose that these debates are sufficiently interrelated to develop a more unified argument. We will show how a Heideggerian perspective is conceptually rich, in both its heritage, as it draws upon both East-Asian wisdom and western thinking, and its engagement, as it confronts the implications of what Heidegger called a 'technical-era', for offering such a unified critique. The focus of this critique is on instrumental forms of mindfulness (mindfulness 'in' education), which when framed by neoliberalism has rather narrow goals concerning individual well-being and performance. In contrast, more critical and integral forms of mindfulness (mindfulness 'as' education) offer the potential for more holistic and authentic learning. Throughout the article, we discuss how Heideggerian philosophy offers a number of useful concepts (e.g., enframing, Dasein, authenticity, meditative thinking), which are able to both critique the instrumentalisation of approaches like mindfulness by neoliberalism and speak to more holistic education oriented toward more authentic being in the world.;"[Brito, Rodrigo; Joseph, Stephen; Sellman, Edward] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Brito, Rodrigo] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.;rodrigobritopastrana@gmail.com;;Sellman, Edward/0000-0001-9124-5502;;;;61;2;2;4;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0309-8249;1467-9752;;J PHILOS EDUC;J.

Education systems have a role to play in this, especially given the growing evidence of a digital divide. Through this study, we look to identify and characterize factors related to the digital skills of 10th grade Chilean students, as measured by a national standardized test. A mixed methodology was used to explore these factors and provide a more detailed analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a Hierarchical Linear Model to determine which factors explain student performance on the test. In addition to this, a qualitative analysis was also carried out using an exploratory case study. The purpose of this case study was to take a more in-depth look at the characteristics of high and low-performing students on the digital skills test. This was done by analyzing their activities, perceptions and motivations when using technology. The quantitative results revealed that the most important factors in developing digital skills are having access to a computer at home, linguistic capital, socioeconomic status, and years of experience using a computer. The qualitative study also revealed that students who scored highly on the test were generally able to focus and concentrate on their school assignments when using the Internet. These students also adopted cognitive and organizational strategies in order to be more effective. Our findings should be further investigated in order to support the design of school activities that aim to develop students' digital skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper presents an operational definition of ICT skills, an instrument measuring these skills as well as the students' results in the test. The definition of ICT skills used considers Chile's curricular framework, functional and cognitive skills. Specifically, ICT skills were defined as the capacity to solve problems of information, communication and knowledge in digital environments. A performance-based assessment was designed in a virtual environment to measure these skills. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of students were able to solve tasks related to the use of information as consumers, i.e., approximately three quarters of the students were able to search for information and half of them were also able to organize and manage digital information. Additionally, they show that very few students were able to succeed in tasks related to the use of information as producers, i.e., only one third of the students were able to develop their own ideas in a digital environment and less than one fifth were able to refine digital information and create a representation in a digital environment. Socioeconomic group, access, daily use and confidence in doing ICT-related activities were all positively associated with higher scores, showing the need to implement strategies to compensate this inequality, possibly by explicitly defining these aims in the national curriculum.

This research presents the educational, quantitative, and qualitative evaluation of an Augmented Reality and Mobile Pedestrian Navigation app. The software was designed for mobile learning in an educational context, to evaluate its effectiveness when applied as a teaching tool, in comparison to similar tools such as those present in e-learning. A mixed-method analysis was used, with primary school students from Chile as subjects (n = 143). They were split into one control group and one experimental group. The control group worked in an e-learning environment, while the experimental group performed the activity as field work, making use of the app (m-learning). Students were evaluated pretest and posttest using an objective test to measure their level of learning. In parallel, a satisfaction survey was carried out concerning the use of these technologies, in addition to interviews with several students and teachers of the experimental group. Pretest-posttest results indicate that the experimental group outperformed the control group in their learning levels. The results of the interviews and the satisfaction survey show that these technologies, combined with fieldwork, increase the effectiveness of the teaching-learning processes. Further, they promote the interaction of students with contents for learning, and they improve students' performance in the educational process. The main goal is to provide a methodology for the analysis of an ad-hoc designed app. The app is intended to provide an m-learning process for subjects being taught about cultural heritage. The quantitative and qualitative results obtained show that it can be more effective than using similar technologies in e-learning contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In e-PELS, students learn to highlight and outline expository passages based on various types of text structures (such as comparison or cause-and-effect) as well as to paraphrase, self-question, and summarize. The study involved 1041 fourth-grade elementary students from 21 schools distributed in three regions in central Chile. Participant teachers integrated this program into the Spanish language curriculum, instructing their students during thirty sessions of 90 min each during one school semester. Pretest-to-posttest gains in reading comprehension scores were significantly greater for students instructed with this program than for students who received traditional instruction (d = .5), with particularly strong effects for lower-achieving students (d = .7). The findings support the efficacy of direct instruction in specific learning strategies in a computer-based environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a significantly different model of educational software that was derived from a case study of two teachers participating in a software design process. It shows the relationship between particular elements of the teachers' pedagogy and the characteristics of the software design. In this model, the 'classroom atmosphere' is embedded in the human-computer interface scenarios and elements, the 'teaching strategy' in the design of the browsing strategies of the software, and the 'learning strategy' in the particular forms of interaction with the software. The model demonstrates significant links between the study of Pedagogy and the study of Information Technology in Education and has implications for the relationship between those two areas of research and consequently for teacher training, The model proposes a perspective on educational software design that takes into consideration not only learning theories, but also teaching theories and practice.

This two-phase study set out to establish the key components, feasibility and acceptability of a group motivational interviewing intervention, focused on alcohol consumption. Methods: In phase 1, focus groups with 12 students and 8 teachers explored issues with existing health education in Wales. Phase 2 involved the development of a 1-hour group motivational interviewing session to address the issues raised. The session was delivered to two classes of students aged 13-15years, facilitated by two motivational interviewing practitioners. Sessions were observed and audio-recorded and coded by two researchers using the Assessment of Motivational Interviewing Groups Observer Scale (AMIGOS). Student acceptability of the session was captured using a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Sessions were consistent with motivational interviewing principles, providing empathic and focused discussion while maximising participants' autonomy and strengths. The majority of students felt listened to during the session, considered it was helpful and felt that they could learn more from this kind of experience. Conclusion: A group motivational interviewing session, developed based on key components identified during focus groups, was shown to be acceptable to students and feasible to deliver in secondary schools. The approach requires further research to establish sustainable delivery mechanisms.;"[Hawkins, Jemma L.; Bravo, Paulina; Jerzembek, Gabrielle; Whitehead, Sarah; Murphy, Simon] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, DECIPHer, 1-3 Museum Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BD, S Glam, Wales; [Bravo, Paulina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Nursing, Santiago, Chile; [Gobat, Nina; Rollnick, Stephen] Cardiff Univ, Cochrane Inst Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Chanon, Sue; Adams, Orla] Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kelson, Mark] Cardiff Univ, South East Wales Trials Unit, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales";;Hawkins, JL (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, DECIPHer, 1-3 Museum Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BD, S Glam, Wales.;HawkinsJ10@cardiff.ac.uk;"Hawkins, Jemma/A-2417-2012; Kelson, Mark J/E-6753-2016";"Hawkins, Jemma/0000-0002-1998-9547; Kelson, Mark J/0000-0001-7744-3780; Gobat, Nina/0000-0002-1558-557X";"National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (NISCHR); NISCHR through the Wales School of Primary Care Research [505090]; Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer), a UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Public Health Research Centre of Excellence; British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-590-28-0005]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission; Welsh Government; Wellcome Trust under the UK Clinical Research CollaborationWellcome Trust [WT087640MA]; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/N010078/1, MR/K023233/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MR/N010078/1, MR/K023233/1] Funding Source: researchfish";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Phase 1 was supported by the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (NISCHR) funded Public Health Improvement Research Network.

The proposals and experiences of the Society for the Construction of Educational Facilities (1937-1987) in Chile and the Board of Constructions for Technical and Secondary Education (1934-1969) in Portugal are analysed. Established in the 1930s, these centralised bodies managed, organised, and controlled state school building projects in such a way as to achieve uniformity in design, creating architectural identities that embodied both the educational values and the representative character of the State. These bodies were influenced by similar global circumstances, and their activities were guided by the recommendations issued by intergovernmental organisations of the time. Such a situation brought their projects closer together in terms of their functional, aesthetic, technical-constructive characteristics. After examining and identifying the international influences which brought them closer in terms of the educational meanings and values associated with school architecture, the paper identifies the local circumstances that guided the design and construction processes of schools in both countries, bringing fresh geographical insights to school architecture discussion. At the same time, possible global readings of strategies, influences and results are explored, enabling us to understand school architecture as part of a nation's cultural values and as a material expression of the social model of modernity, which will continue to meet the challenges that schools face in twenty-first-century society.;"[Gilles, Claudia Torres] Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile; [Alegre, Alexandra] Univ Lisbon, CITUA, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal";;Gilles, CT (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile.;claudiatorres@uchilefau.cl;"Alegre, Alexandra/AAC-4817-2020; Torres Gilles, Claudia/J-4083-2015";"Alegre, Alexandra/0000-0002-7280-5073; Torres Gilles, Claudia/0000-0002-5577-1385";"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014]";"This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014].";;46;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0030-9230;1477-674X;;PAEDAGOG HIST;Paedagog.

The purpose of this study is to present recent research on organizational change processes in universities. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach applied corresponds to the social issue maturation framework, to identify, describe and assess patterns of change across higher education institutions. The maturation of sustainability in universities can be divided into four stages: emergence, popularization, formalization and maturity. Findings The findings indicate that sustainability processes often begin as ad hoc processes which grow and mature over time as a range of different actors join in. However, sustainability in universities is increasingly connected with sustainability in the private sector and with other public actors. Moreover, there is a growing acknowledgement of the interactions between society, industry and academia. Originality/value The value of the paper is to provide a critical assessment of the potential of living lab projects initiated in Belgium (Brussels) and Chile (Santiago de Chile) to anchor sustainability firmly both in the functioning of the university and in the interactions with the neighborhood. The authors reflect on the requirements and the implementation of these initiatives as a strong indication of mature sustainability integration in, and by way of, universities.;"[Vargas, Luis] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Mac-Lean, Claudia] Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Huge, Jean] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Syst Ecol & Resource Management Unit, Brussels, Belgium";;Mac-Lean, C (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile.;clau.maclean.b@gmail.com;vargas, luis/A-2109-2011;"vargas, Luis/0000-0001-6539-1768; Huge, Jean/0000-0002-3695-547X";"Complex Engineering Systems Institute, ISCI [CONICYT: FB0816]; VLIR-UOS; ARES";L.

This supports the theorization of learning as a socio-cultural practice, framed by Vygotsky and developed by other researchers such as Rogoff, Lave and Wenger. However, there is also evidence that working collaboratively may not be a spontaneous response to working in a group, and that teaching learners how to collaborate, and in particular how to work together to negotiate meaning, is a necessary part of the process of learning collaboratively which can enhance outcomes further. A question for the computer supported collaborative learning community then arises as to whether learning to collaborate can be scaffolded through the use of digital tools, and what such tools might look like. This paper reports on the design of a digital system that aims to support the practice of face-to-face collaboration on open-ended tasks. Findings from trials of the system in classrooms in the UK and Chile show that the model is welcomed both by teachers and pupils, and met its objectives of ensuring greater interaction between class members who did not normally work together, and involvement of all individuals in discussion based activities.

However, the social sciences, especially in Latin America, have only lately become interested in the subject and their approach is still vague. Scientific understanding of global environmental change and the process of designing public policies to face them are characterized by their complexity as well as by epistemic and normative uncertainties. This makes it necessary to problematize the way in which research efforts understand 'the social' of climate change. How do 'the climate' and 'the social' interpenetrate as scientific objects? What does the resulting field look like? Is the combination capable of promoting reflexivity and collaboration on the issue, or does it merely become dispersed with diffuse boundaries? Our paper seeks to answer these and other related questions using Chile as a case study and examining peer-reviewed scientific research on the topic. By combining in-depth qualitative content analysis of each paper with a statistical meta-analysis, we were able to: characterize the key content and forms of such literature; identify divisions and patterns within it; and, discuss some factors and trends that may help explain these. We conclude that the literature displays two competing trends: while it is inclined to become fragmented beyond the scope of the 'mitigation' black box, it also tends to cluster along the lines of methodological distinctions traditionally contested within the social sciences. This, in turn, highlights the persistence of disciplinary divisions within an allegedly interdisciplinary field.";"[Billi, Marco; Blanco, Gustavo; Urquiza, Anahi] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas Latitu, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Urquiza, Anahi] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Av Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;"Billi, M (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.";mbilli@alumnos.uai.cl;"Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/N-8046-2019; Billi, Marco/ABG-2953-2020; Urquiza, Anahí/P-8822-2019";"Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/0000-0002-4980-3424; Urquiza, Anahí/0000-0001-6901-0846; Billi, Marco/0000-0003-3161-6468";"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project [15110009, 15150003]; National PhD Scholarship (Chile) [CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160857, 11180824]; Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile) [NS130017]";"This work has received funding provided by the following institutional grants: Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15110009 (all authors); National PhD Scholarship (Chile) No. CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15150003 (Gustavo Blanco); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 1160857 (Gustavo Blanco); Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile), Project No. NS130017 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 11180824 (Anahi Urquiza).";;73;5;5;1;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0026-4695;1573-1871;;MINERVA;Minerva;SEP;2019;57;3;;;;;293;315;;10.1007/s11024-019-09369-2;;;23;"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics";IW5KO;WOS:000485017600002;;hybrid;;;2022-04-06;

Many of those who would have studied in the United States if this decrease had not occurred would have returned home to serve their countries. To estimate the impact of this loss, a survey was conducted in six major cities in Latin America between 1983 and 1989. Selected local medical students interviewed 554 physicians who had returned home after U.S. training and 60 of their classmates who had not trained there. The findings indicate that the returned physicians had given approximately twice as much time to teaching, research, and medical administration as did those who had not left home. The authors maintain that this and related findings show how the curtailment of opportunities for training foreign nationals in the United States is detrimental to both the aspirations of developing nations and the influence of the United States in world affairs.;"UNIV PERUANA CAYETANO HEREDIA,LIMA,PERU; CATHOLIC UNIV CHILE,SANTIAGO,CHILE; UNIV FED RIO GRANDE SUL,BR-90000 PORTO ALEGRE,RS,BRAZIL; UNIV NACL PEDRO HENRIQUEZ URENA,SANTO DOMINGO,DOMINICAN REP; UNIV CATOLICA CUENCA,CUENCA,ECUADOR; UNIV JAVERIANA,BOGOTA,COLOMBIA";;HARRINGTON, WJ (corresponding author), UNIV MIAMI,SCH MED,DEPT INTERNAL MED R36,POB 016760,MIAMI,FL 33101, USA.;;;;;;;6;2;2;0;0;HANLEY & BELFUS INC;PHILADELPHIA;210 S 13TH ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19107;1040-2446;;;ACAD MED;Acad.

While prior research describes early career researchers' isolation in their institutions, we theorize early career researchers' isolation in their academic fields and reveal how they attempt to mitigate isolation to improve their career prospects. Using a collaborative autoethnographic approach, we generate and analyze a dataset focused on the experiences of 10 early career researchers in a globalizing business academic field known as consumer culture theory. We identify bricolage practices, polycentric governance practices, and integration mechanisms that work to enhance early career researchers' perceptions of agency, and consequently, mitigate their academic isolation. Our findings extend discussions on isolation and its role in new academic careers. Early career researchers, in particular, can benefit from a deeper understanding of practices that can enable them to mitigate isolation and reclaim agency as they engage with global academic fields.;"[Belkhir, Meriam] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Brouard, Myriam] HEC Montreal, Mkt, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Brunk, Katja H.] Europa Univ Viadrina, Mkt, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Dalmoro, Marlon] UNIVATES, Lajeado, RS, Brazil; [Ferreira, Marcia Christina] Brunel Univ London, Mkt & Operat, London, England; [Figueiredo, Bernardo] RMIT Univ, Mkt, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Huff, Aimee Dinnin] Oregon State Univ, Mkt, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Scaraboto, Daiane] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Mkt, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Sibai, Olivier] Birkbeck Univ London, Mkt, London, England; [Smith, Andrew N.] Suffolk Univ, Mkt, Sawyer Sch Business, Boston, MA 02114 USA";;Belkhir, M (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.;;"Ferreira, Marcia Christina/AAQ-1199-2020; Scaraboto, Daiane/AAD-7673-2020";"Ferreira, Marcia Christina/0000-0003-2599-8754; Scaraboto, Daiane/0000-0002-7658-9339; Huff, Aimee Dinnin/0000-0002-8261-3411; Dalmoro, Marlon/0000-0002-6211-0905; Amado Figueiredo, Bernardo/0000-0003-1935-4370";;;;131;13;13;2;14;ACAD MANAGEMENT;BRIARCLIFF MANOR;PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA;1537-260X;;;ACAD MANAG LEARN EDU;Acad.

However, little is known about what students have learned about NOSI during their pre-college school years. The purpose of this large-scale follow-up international project (i.e. 32 countries and regions, spanning six continents and including 3917 students for the high school sample) was to collect data on what exiting high school students have learned about NOSI. Additionally, the study investigated changes in 12th grade students' NOSI understandings compared to seventh grade (i.e. 20 countries and regions) students' understandings from a prior investigation [Lederman et al. (2019). An international collaborative investigation of beginning seventh grade students' understandings of scientific inquiry: Establishing a baseline. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 56(4), 486-515. ]. This study documents and discusses graduating high school students' understandings and compares their understandings to seventh grade students' understandings of the same aspects of scientific inquiry for each country. It is important to note that collecting data from each of the 130+ countries globally was not feasible. Similarly, it was not possible to collect data from every region of each country. A concerted effort was made, however, to provide a relatively representative picture of each country and the world.;"[Lederman, J. S.; Lederman, N.

This depletion effect can be incorporated into cognitive load theory that is concerned with using the properties of human cognitive architecture, especially working memory, when designing instruction. Two experiments were carried out on the spacing effect that occurs when learning that is spaced by temporal gaps between learning episodes is superior to identical, massed learning with no gaps between learning episodes. Using primary school students learning mathematics, it was found that students obtained lower scores on a working memory capacity test (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher ratings of cognitive load (Experiment 2) after massed than after spaced practice. The reduction in working memory capacity may be attributed to working memory resource depletion following the relatively prolonged mental effort associated with massed compared to spaced practice. An expansion of cognitive load theory to incorporate working memory resource depletion along with instructional design implications, including the spacing effect, is discussed.;"[Chen, Ouhao; Sweller, John] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Chen, Ouhao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Early Start Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;"Chen, OH; Sweller, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Chen, OH (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.";"chenouhao_lucky@126.com; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; paas@fsw.eur.nl; j.sweller@unsw.edu.au";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Chen, Ouhao/0000-0001-9645-1946";"CONICYT PAI [82140021]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";"The second author acknowledges partial funding from CONICYT PAI, national funding research program for returning researchers from abroad, 2014, No 82140021; and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB0003.";;30;51;52;8;38;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

Several agents' characteristics may moderate their instructional effectiveness, including appearance, gender, nonverbal communication, motion, and voice. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test hypotheses from diverse theories predicting the effects of these agents' characteristics. We tested predictions of cognitive load theory, cognitive theory of multimedia learning, computers are social actors, social agency theory, uncanny valley, and the action observation network. Our meta-analysis of 32 effect sizes (N = 2104) revealed a small overall effect (g+ = 0.20), showing that learning with multimedia pedagogical agents was more effective than learning without these agents. As predicted by the redundancy effect of cognitive load theory and the coherence principle of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, 2D agents (g+ = 0.38) tended to be more effective than 3D agents (g+ = 0.11). As predicted by the computers are social actors hypothesis, most of the agents' characteristics, including nonverbal communication, motion, and voice, appeared not to moderate their effectiveness. We conclude that multimedia pedagogical agents help learning through multimedia, and that students may be able to learn similarly from different types of agents.;"[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Wong, Rachel M.; Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; rachel.wong@wsu.edu; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu; paas@essb.eur.nl";;Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]";This study is funded from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255.;;107;3;3;23;36;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

In this review article we focus on five of these strategies or solutions to problematic instructional designs in multimedia learning: (a) the multimedia principle (use visualizations and drawings to complement texts); (b) the split-attention effect or spatial contiguity principle (show texts contiguously or integrated with visualizations); (c) the redundancy effect, alike the coherence principle (remove nonessential learning information); (d) the signaling principle (cue or signal essential learning information); and (e) the transient information effect or segmenting principle (segment or control the pace of animations and videos). Usually, both cognitive theories have investigated solutions that instructors, teachers, and designers should pursue to optimize students' learning. Here, in a novel approach, we show that these strategies can also be used by learners who want to self-manage their cognitive load and learning process. We provide several examples of both instructor- and learner-managed solutions aligned with these strategies. When assessing which agent, either the instructor or the learner, was most effective, we observed mixed results in the literature. However, the expertise reversal effect may help predict the direction of these effects: novice students may learn better under instructor-managed conditions, whereas more expert students may learn more under learner-managed conditions.";"[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [de Koning, Bjorn B.; Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fiorella, Logan] Univ Georgia, Dept Educ Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; b.b.dekoning@essb.eur.nl; lfiorella@uga.edu; paas@essb.eur.nl";;Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]";Funding from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255 is gratefully acknowledged.;;168;6;6;27;38;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

This article presents an assessment developed for creativity that provides a score for mathematical creativity (MaC) in addition to a score for general creativity in the numeric domain, or what we might call numerical creativity (NuC). We developed different rating scales for each and then explored how each scoring method accounts for the students' mathematical/numerical and creative skills. The psychometric properties for both scoring approaches were examined. Each method was shown to reflect different relationships with other performance tests. In addition, it is proposed that MaC may provide useful insight into students' levels of adaptive expertise in mathematics, as reflected by their ability to apply mathematical knowledge (i.e., language, operations, concepts) to novel situations, representing an informative supplement to performance indicators of math achievement.;"[Tan, Mei; Mourgues, Catalina; Grigorenko, Elena L.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Mourgues, Catalina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bolden, David S.] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Grigorenko, Elena L.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Grigorenko, Elena L.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia";;Grigorenko, EL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, 230 South Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.;elena.grigorenko@yale.edu;"Mourgues, Catalina/T-5811-2019; Grigorenko, Elena/V-2418-2019";Bolden, David/0000-0002-2717-7266;;;;51;7;12;1;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-0175;2162-6057;;J CREATIVE BEHAV;J.

Two settings for national research grant competitions aimed at early-career scientists are introduced, namely the New Zealand Marsden award and the Chilean Fondecyt award. A framework of five constituent moves is formulated and 36 collected grant proposal abstracts are analyzed for their movestructure patterns and accompanying lexico-grammatical signals. A prototypical movestructure pattern is formulated and exemplified with abstracts from both settings and different disciplines, while key variations on this prototypical pattern are also described and analyzed. The findings suggest that a majority of abstracts are near-prototypical in structure (i.e., showing a single variation on a shared prototype) and therefore collectively maintain and reinforce this prototypical pattern as a common reference even as they individually diverge from it for their own rhetorical purposes.

In this journey, there has been considerable progress nationwide in the education of a generation of children in an intercultural socio-educational environment. However, there still exist challenges for ongoing progress towards specific goals, such as bilingualism in children. Bilingual education policies in Chile have focused mainly on 6-13-year-old children, relegating preschool education (0-6 years), one of the most relevant educational levels in the socio-linguistic revival process, to a secondary role. In this context, we examine top-down official policy documents regarding intercultural education in early childhood, developed between 2007 and 2016. Attempting to identify some of the main foci of the language policies that may influence the implementation in preschools, we present an intertextual and critical language policy analysis of these documents used in intercultural and bilingual preschools. In doing so, we compare the consistencies and locate the implicit inconsistencies in the policy positions on bilingual education in preschools. We conclude the article by outlining suggestions for languages policies and teacher education in Chile, and the possible implications for other countries.;"[Becerra-Lubies, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile; [Mayo, Simona] Univ Nacl San Martin, Ctr Estudios Lenguaje Soc, San Martin, Argentina; [Fones, Aliza] Univ Iowa, Coll Educ, Iowa City, IA USA";;Becerra-Lubies, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile.;rubecerra@uc.cl;;Mayo, Simona/0000-0002-1775-6141;"Grant CONICYT; Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160746]";This work was supported by the Grant CONICYT and Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [grant number 11160746];;58;1;1;8;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1367-0050;1747-7522;;INT J BILING EDUC BI;Int.

Various types of oral CF are first identified, and the results of research revealing CF frequency across instructional contexts are presented. Research on CF preferences is then reviewed, revealing a tendency for learners to prefer receiving CF more than teachers feel they should provide it. Next, theoretical perspectives in support of CF are presented and some contentious issues addressed related to the role of learner uptake, the role of instruction, and the overall purpose of CF: to initiate the acquisition of new knowledge or to consolidate already acquired knowledge. A brief review of laboratory studies assessing the effects of recasts is then presented before we focus on classroom studies assessing the effects of different types of CF. Many variables mediate CF effectiveness: of these, we discuss linguistic targets and learners' age in terms of both previous and prospective research.

This study sought to understand SSWs' views about mental health and trauma in relation to the pandemic and schools reopening. Data came from written responses to open-ended questions on a national survey of SSWs during June-July 2020 (Kelly et al., 2021; Watson et al., 2022). In the national survey, 450 SSWs responded to open-ended questions, providing 115 single-spaced pages of detailed qualitative comments. A unified conceptual model for a trauma-informed school was created by integrating components suggested within the literature. This conceptual model was then used to generate a theory-based coding schema. Responses mapped well onto the conceptual model. Major themes included recognition of COVID-19 and 2020 social unrest as a unique period and potentially traumatic experience; the need for a trauma-informed school response; the challenges of addressing all facets of safety during the pandemic; and the essentiality and difficulty of maintaining school-based relationships during school closures and remote learning. Results demonstrated that SSWs used and discussed key components of a trauma-informed approach. Respondents offered several recommendations for implementing trauma-informed approaches during and after the pandemic, many of which required collaboration from other school staff. Findings provide empirical support for a unified school model that integrates components of a trauma-informed approach found in the literature.

This study aimed to evaluate how dental students are using online video content. Materials and Methods Students from eight Universities (Athens, Birmingham, Brescia, Cardiff, Melbourne, Paris, Sao Paulo and Valdivia) representing three continents were invited to complete a survey on their access and learning from online videos. Results International students behave similarly when studying dental content online. Of 515 respondents, 94.6% use the Internet as a learning tool. It was observed that videos are not frequently recommended during didactic lectures (9.6%). But many students (79.9%) will use YouTube for their learning which includes clinical procedures. Students will check online content before performing procedures for the first time (74.8%), to understand what was explained in class (65.9%) or read in books (59.5%), to relearn clinical techniques (64.7%) and to visualise rare procedures (49.8%). More than half of the students do not fully trust the accuracy or the reliability of online content. This does not prevent students from watching and sharing dental videos with classmates (64.4%). The content watched is not shared with teachers (23.3%) even when it contradicts what was learnt in the school (38.2%). Conclusion This study concludes that students regularly integrate open access digital resources into learning portfolios but are hesitant to inform their teachers about their viewing habits. Students wish to receive critical skills on how to evaluate the material they encounter outside their traditional learning space.";"[da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias; Pereira, Andresa Costa; Walmsley, Anthony Damien] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias; Pereira, Andresa Costa] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil; [Vital, Sibylle] Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Marino, Rodrigo; Ghanim, Aghareed] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Skelton-Macedo, Mary Caroline] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Kavadella, Argyro; Kakaboura, Afrodite] European Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Univ Austral Chile, Valdivia, Chile; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Johnson, Ilona] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, Wales; [Dalessandri, Domenico] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy";;da Silva, MAD (corresponding author), CSTR UFCG Rod,Patos Teixeira S-N, BR-58708110 Patos de Minas, PB, Brazil.;marco.dias@professor.ufcg.edu.br;da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias/K-4730-2012;"da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias/0000-0002-2774-4769; Pereira, Andresa Costa/0000-0002-3654-6123; Marino, Rodrigo/0000-0002-3061-843X; Uribe, Sergio/0000-0003-0684-2025; Skelton-Macedo, Mary Caroline/0000-0002-4189-5088";European UnionEuropean Commission [748609];This manuscript is part of the C2LEARN project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 748609;;38;0;0;1;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Methodologically, these studies have addressed human vocalisation at an individual level. In the present study, we asked whether patterns such as musical intervals can also be found among the voices of people engaging in a conversation as an emerging interpersonal phenomenon. Fifty-six participants were randomly paired and assigned to either a control or a low-trust condition. Frequency ratios were generated by juxtaposing nonlocal fundamental frequency (f0) productions from two people engaged in each given dyadic conversation. Differences were found among conditions, both in terms of interval distribution and precision. These results support the idea that psychological dispositions modulate the musical intervals generated between participants through mutual real-time vocal accommodation. They also underscore the inter-domain use of musical intervals.;"[Robledo, Juan P.; Hurtado, Esteban; Prado, Felipe; Cornejo, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Language Interact & Phenomenol Lab LIF, Santiago, Chile; [Hurtado, Esteban] Univ Diego Portales, UDP INECO Fdn Core Neurosci UIFCoN, Lab Cognit & Social Neurosci, Santiago, Chile; [Roman, Domingo] Univ Santiago Chile, Humanities Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Robledo, Juan P.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Mus, Ctr Mus & Sci, Cambridge, England";;Robledo, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England.;jper2@cam.ac.uk;Cornejo, Carlos/Q-6871-2017;"Cornejo, Carlos/0000-0001-5426-0025; Prado, Felipe/0000-0003-3257-9646";Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [1100863];Ethical approval for this project was given by the Ethical Committee of the Psychology Department of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile as well as by the Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [Grant 1100863].;;52;1;1;0;7;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0305-7356;1741-3087;;PSYCHOL MUSIC;Psychol.

In turn, the perceived importance of environmental sustainability within higher education is growing at a rapid rate. This paper provides a summary of key elements as they apply to dentistry, and provides an introduction to the reader of an early consensus of how sustainability could be included as part of the dental curriculum. Methods The consensus opinion within this paper largely centres around discussion at the ADEE sustainability workshop at the annual conference in Berlin (August 2019). In order to help inform discussions at the workshop, a brief scoping questionnaire was circulated to potential participants regarding their understanding and current teaching practices in sustainability. An infographic was designed to help delegates remember the important elements of sustainable dentistry. Delegates discussed the concept of sustainability alongside the infographic, and how they could link these with the Graduating European Dentist (GED) curriculum. Results The discussions within the workshop largely centred around 4 main themes: Disease prevention and health promotion, Patient education and empowerment, Lean service delivery and Preferential use of strategies with lower environmental impact. Discussion It is apparent that there is a widespread need for teaching materials relating to environmental sustainability; this includes specific learning outcomes relating to the 4 educational domains of the Graduating European Dentist curriculum, and methods for teaching and assessing these outcomes.

Several studies have shown that such victimization exists in multiple contexts and there is considerable variation in prevalence among contexts. This study examined the prevalence of student victimization in public schools by staff members and its relationships with other school-related factors in the context of Kosovo. The sample was designed to represent all students from Grades 6-9 in 13 of Kosovo's 38 municipalities. The sample consisted of 12,040 students from 100 schools, 49.2% of whom were female. They were equally divided between Grades 6 to 9. Overall, more than a quarter of the students reported that a staff member victimized them in the last month. The least prevalent victimization type was sexual-touched or tried to touch you in a sexual manner (2.3%). The most prevalent physical behavior was slapping (15.8%); 12.7% reported being offended or humiliated by a staff member and 8.3% indicated that a staff member cursed them. Boys were victimized significantly more than girls for all types of victimization. The strongest predictors of staff victimization of students were students' involvement in peer-to-peer victimization and risky behaviors, which were correlated with school climate.

Patterns of technology usage illuminate these opportunities and risks. However, no studies have assessed the usage patterns (frequency, duration, and intensity) and related factors in young people with intellectual disabilities. MethodsQuestionnaires on Internet and cell phone usage patterns, the Internet Over-Use Scale and the Cell-Phone Over-Use Scale, as well as the Beck Depression Inventory were filled out in one-on-one interviews of 216 youth with intellectual disabilities. ResultsYoung people with disabilities make more social and recreational rather than educational use of these tools, and show higher rates of excessive use of both technologies than a comparison group of 410 young people without disabilities. Also, their overuse is associated with other unhealthy behaviors.

This methodology is attractive, as it allows institutions to reuse high-quality material developed for MOOCs, while increasing learning flexibility and the students' autonomy. However, the adoption of this methodology is low in general, especially in Engineering courses, as its implementation faces a number of challenges for students. The most salient challenge is the lack of student self-regulatory skills, which may result in frustration and low performance. In this paper, we study how a self-regulatory learning technological scaffold, which provides students with feedback about their activity in the MOOC, affects the engagement and performance of students in an Engineering course following a MOOC-based FC approach. To this end, we design an observational study with the participation of 242 students: 133 students in the experimental group (EG) who used a technological scaffold and 109 in the control group (CG) who did not.

Participants: 1,212 students from the Universidad de La Frontera, Chile (mean age 18.7 +/- 2.15) were surveyed in January-March 2018. Methods: Participants completed a cross-sectional self-report survey to evaluate QOL using the WHOQOL-BREF scale and eating habits with a food habits survey. Results: Students reporting a better healthy eating habits score also presented a higher QOL. Eating breakfast and eating home-cooked meals is a protective factor for QOL in each domain. The consumption of sweet snacks was shown to be a risk factor for the physical health and environment domains. The consumption of fast food is shown as the greatest risk factor in the physical domain. Conclusion: Healthy and unhealthy eating habits are associated with different dimensions of QOL.

The current mixed-method study compared the effects of a specific implementation of whole-class interactive instruction, Single Display Groupware (SDG), with traditional classical instruction of geometry, for 69 third-grade students. In SDG students work in groups that share one area on a large display screen in front of the class. Each individual student in a group has a mouse and together the students in each group need to perform assignments by using silent collaboration. In the current study, the assignment for the students was to identify and create different kinds of triangles. Outcomes of interest were learning gains (quantitative) and effectiveness of silent collaboration (qualitative). Learning gains were significantly higher for students in the SDG condition than for students following traditional instruction. An analysis of emerging activity patterns showed that students found natural ways to silently collaborate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to test risk and protective factor assumptions of the IPM using a prospective cohort study with 12months separating baseline from follow-up. Participants were students in grades 8 and 9 in the national Icelandic school system enrolled in the spring of 2018 and 2019 (N=2165). Participants self-reported their experiences of cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use and seven risk and protective factors. Analyses were conducted with generalized linear modeling with extension to general estimating equations with correlated outcomes data. Both individual main-effects models and collective models including all main-effects were tested. Out of 28 individual main-effects models, 23 produced findings consistent with study premises (P<0.05). Multiple main-effects models largely sustained the findings of the individual main-effects models. Findings support the assumption that the risk and protective factors commonly emphasized in the IPM are associated with the four different substance use outcomes in the hypothesized direction. Communities that plan to implement the IPM among adolescents might consider these factors in their work.;"[Kristjansson, Alfgeir L.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Kristjansson, Alfgeir L.; Thorisdottir, Ingibjorg E.; Allegrante, John P.; Sigfusson, Jon; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Reykjavik Univ, Lceland Ctr Social Res & Anal, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Lilly, Christa L.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Thorisdottir, Ingibjorg E.; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Reykjavik Univ, Dept Psychol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Allegrante, John P.; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Dept Hlth & Behav Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Allegrante, John P.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Sociomed Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Mann, Michael J.] Boise State Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Dept Community & Environm Hlth, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Soriano, Humberto E.] P Univ Catolica, Div Pediat, Santiago 8330024, RM, Chile";;"Kristjansson, AL (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.; Kristjansson, AL (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Lceland Ctr Social Res & Anal, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.";alkristjansson@hsc.wvu.edu;;;"European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-CoG-2014-647860]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [2U54GM104942-02]";This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) award ERC-CoG-2014-647860 and by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) award 2U54GM104942-02.;;39;2;2;2;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1153;1465-3648;;HEALTH EDUC RES;Health Educ.

Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills, but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and promote greater cognitive learning. This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and participation experience measures.;"[Feng, Zhenan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Amor, Robert] Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lovreglio, Ruggiero] Massey Univ, Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso, Chile";;Feng, ZA (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.;zfen124@aucklanduni.ac.nz;"Lovreglio, Ruggiero/AAH-7275-2019; Amor, Robert/L-9611-2019; Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo/AAA-4172-2022; Feng, Zhenan/N-1336-2018";"Lovreglio, Ruggiero/0000-0003-4596-7656; Amor, Robert/0000-0002-4329-9044; Feng, Zhenan/0000-0001-7513-8942";;;;68;96;96;24;136;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

This problem is present not only in instructional pictures concerning the curricular topics (e.g., science, technology, engineering and mathematics: STEM), but also in those depicting extracurricular tasks (e.g., human movement tasks). When factors such as appeal, media, realism, size, and interaction are not tightly controlled between statics and animations, researchers may often be comparing apples with oranges. In this review, we provide a categorization of these confounding variables and offer some possible solutions to generate more tightly controlled studies. Future research could consider these biases and solutions, in order to design more equivalent visualizations. As a result, more conclusive evidence could be obtained identifying the boundary conditions for when static or dynamic images are more suitable for educational purposes, across both curricular and extracurricular tasks.

SRL is critical in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance, as is commonly the case in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Learners can be trained to engage in SRL and actively supported with prompts and activities. However, effective implementation of learner support systems in MOOCs requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in online behavior. Moreover, identifying learner characteristics that are predictive of weaker SRL skills can advance efforts to provide targeted support without obtrusive survey instruments. We investigated SRL in a sample of 4,831 learners across six MOOCs based on individual records of overall course achievement, interactions with course content, and survey responses. We found that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking was associated with lower goal attainment. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. Several learner characteristics, including demographics and motivation, predicted learners' SRL skills. We discuss implications for theory and the development of learning environments that provide adaptive support. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is still a dearth of research on developing CPS skills among elementary-school students. Our research therefore looks at how elementary school students' regulation skills and emotions are supported by a collaborative game using a collaboration script to scaffold group awareness. An intervention was carried out with a sample of 223 students aged between 10 and 13. The experimental group worked collaboratively in sub-groups, scaffolded by the game, while the control group attended regular lessons. The students' attitudes towards collaboration were evaluated before and after the intervention. In addition to this, a focus group was held a week after the intervention, which involved 32 students from both groups. The quantitative analysis revealed that attitudes towards collaboration improved significantly among students in the experimental group. This difference can be explained by a combination of the intervention, the students' initial attitudes, and their respective GPAs. The qualitative analysis provided evidence of the regulation processes and emotions that emerge when combining a collaboration script with group awareness tools during CPS activities. Furthermore, the results highlighted the relationship between these tools and positive emotions (i.e., satisfaction), co-regulation, and shared regulation. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the co-regulation process required by the game and a shift in emotions from frustration to satisfaction. This work provides evidence of how scaffolding group awareness using a collaboration script supports regulation skills and emotions, thus promoting the development of Collaborative Problem-Solving skills.;"[Rojas, Matias; Nussbaum, Miguel; Guerrero, Orlando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Santiago, Chile; [Greiff, Samuel] Univ Luxembourg, Cognit Sci & Assessment, 2,Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Del Rio, Rodrigo] Harvard Univ, Romance Languages & Literatures, Boylston Hall, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Alvares, Danilo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile";;Rojas, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile.;mirojas1@uc.cl;;;Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico / Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [FONDECYT 1180024];This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico / Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [FONDECYT 1180024].;;94;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1556-1607;1556-1615;;INT J COMP-SUPP COLL;Int.

The test was applied to a sample of 828 in-service teachers in Chile, together with a characterization questionnaire. Results showed that very few Chilean teachers mastered all the tasks and that only one third were able to provide students with orientations in solving information and communication tasks, revealing that the majority are not playing a mediation role in a digital environment. In relation to explaining variables, science and younger teachers with more years of teaching experience performed better in the test. Nevertheless the low explanation provided by the variables included suggests that variables that have previously accounted for teachers ICT integration are not as good in predicting TIDE capacity. This shows the relevance of developing mixed methods research that together with quantitative data provides qualitative data to help explain this capacity in greater depth.;"[Claro, Magdalena; Salinas, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Study Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Santiago, Chile; [Cabello-Hutt, Tania] Univ N Carolina, Dept Sociol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [San Martin, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Math, Santiago, Chile; [San Martin, Ernesto] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Preiss, David D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, MIDE UC Measurement Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Jara, Ignacio] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Claro, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.;"mclarot@uc.cl; asalinase@uc.cl; tjcabell@uc.cl; esanmart@mat.puc.cl; davidpreiss@uc.cl; sfvalenz@uc.cl; ijarav@uc.cl";"Salinas, Alvaro/F-9959-2012; San+Martín, Ernesto/AAQ-2374-2021; Preiss, David Daniel/E-6906-2012";"Salinas, Alvaro/0000-0001-9655-761X; Preiss, David Daniel/0000-0002-4646-5060; Claro, Magdalena/0000-0002-4974-4380";Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF-CONICYT) [D10I1037];Research supported by the Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF-CONICYT), under the grant D10I1037.;;56;58;66;12;121;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Consequently, when learning from dynamic pictures, students must process in working memory the current images while trying to remember the images that left the screen. This additional activity in working memory may lead dynamic pictures to be less suitable instructional materials than comparable static pictures, which are more permanent. In order to directly show the influence of transient visual information on dynamic learning environments, we designed a well-matched comparison between a permanent and a transient presentation of an abstract-symbol memory task on the computer. In the task, 104 university students (50% females) had to memorize the type, color, and position of the symbols in a rectangular configuration. In addition, an embodied cognition factor was included where the symbols in the task were either shown with a precision grasping static hand or not. We also assessed how individual characteristics (spatial ability, spatial memory span, and gender) influenced performance. Results showed that (a) permanent outperformed transient presentations, (b) observing hands hindered learning, and (c) high spatial ability and high spatial memory span were beneficial, but gender did not affect performance.

In order to produce a working document for the dental educator, this paper focuses on those methods where IT can assist in the education and competence development of dental students and dentists (e.g. e-learning, distance learning, simulations and computer-based assessment). Web pages and other information-gathering devices have become an essential part of our daily life, as they provide extensive information on all aspects of our society. This is mirrored in dental education where there are many different tools available, as listed in this report. IT offers added value to traditional teaching methods and examples are provided. In spite of the continuing debate on the learning effectiveness of e-learning applications, students request such approaches as an adjunct to the traditional delivery of learning materials. Faculty require support to enable them to effectively use the technology to the benefit of their students. This support should be provided by the institution and it is suggested that, where possible, institutions should appoint an e-learning champion with good interpersonal skills to support and encourage faculty change. From a global prospective, all students and faculty should have access to e-learning tools. This report encourages open access to e-learning material, platforms and programs. The quality of such learning materials must have well defined learning objectives and involve peer review to ensure content validity, accuracy, currency, the use of evidence-based data and the use of best practices. To ensure that the developers' intellectual rights are protected, the original content needs to be secure from unauthorized changes. Strategies and recommendations on how to improve the quality of e-learning are outlined. In the area of assessment, traditional examination schemes can be enriched by IT, whilst the Internet can provide many innovative approaches. Future trends in IT will evolve around improved uptake and access facilitated by the technology (hardware and software). The use of Web 2.0 shows considerable promise and this may have implications on a global level. For example, the one-laptop-per-child project is the best example of what Web 2.0 can do: minimal use of hardware to maximize use of the Internet structure. In essence, simple technology can overcome many of the barriers to learning. IT will always remain exciting, as it is always changing and the users, whether dental students, educators or patients are like chameleons adapting to the ever-changing landscape.;"[Mattheos, N.; Attstrom, R.] Malmo Univ Hosp, Ctr Oral Hlth Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Mattheos, N.] Univ Bern, Sch Dent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Stefanovic, N.] Univ Belgrade, Fac Stomatol, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Apse, P.; Care, R.] Riga Stradina Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Buchanan, J.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Brown, P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Camilleri, A.] Univ Malta, Fac Dent Surg, Msida, Malta; [Fabrikant, E.] Moscow State Univ Med & Dent, Moscow, Russia; [Gundersen, S.] Univ Oslo, Fac Dent, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Honkala, S.] Finnish Dent Soc Apollonia, Helsinki, Finland; [Johnson, L.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jonas, I.] Univ Dent Sch, Freiburg, Germany; [Kavadella, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Athens, Greece; [Moreira, J.] Inst Super Ciencias Dentarias, Oporto, Portugal; [Peroz, I.; Seemann, R.] Charite, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Perryer, D.

This concern has increased the study of the phenomena, which has resulted in many scientific publications. Mobbing has been characterised as an emerging risk at work. The aim of this longitudinal study was to analyse the influence of mobbing on depressive symptoms in a sample of employees working with people with intellectual disabilities (ID). MethodThe sample consisted of 372 Spanish employees working with people with ID at 61 job centres in the Valencian Community (Spain). Seventy-nine (21.2%) participants were men, and 293 were (78.8%) women. Mobbing was evaluated by the Mobbing-UNIPSICO scale, and depressive symptoms were measured using the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale. Using analyses of variance (anova), we tested the differences in depressive symptoms according to the mobbing criteria indicated by Leymann, that is, frequency and duration at Time 1 and Time 2. ResultsEmployees who met the mobbing criteria: frequency (at least once a week) and duration (at least 6 months) at the two study times presented significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than employees who met mobbing criteria at Time 1, but did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 2, and employees who did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 1 or Time 2. ConclusionsWe conclude that permanence of mobbing from Time 1 to Time 2 increases depressive symptoms.;"[Figueiredo-Ferraz, H.; Gil-Monte, P.

Methods Ninety-five adolescents with DS (44.2% girls) and a control group of 113 adolescents (47.8% girls), aged between 11 and 18 years old, from the UP & DOWN study were included in this substudy. Serum C-reactive protein, C3 and C4 complement factors, total proteins, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, insulin, cortisol, leptin, adiponectin, galactin-3 and visfatin were analysed; homeostatic model assessment index was calculated. In order to evaluate adiposity, we measured the following body fat variables: weight, height, waist circumference and skinfold thicknesses. Birth weight was obtained by questionnaire. In addition, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body fat percentage (BF%) were calculated. Results Down syndrome group showed higher levels of body mass index, WHtR, waist circumference, BF% and lower birth weight than controls (P < 0.001). In the general linear model in the total sample, WHtR was positively associated with C3 and C4 (P < 0.001) as well as with leptin levels (P = 0.015). BF% was positively associated with total proteins (P = 0.093) and leptin levels (P < 0.001). DS was positively associated with total proteins (P < 0.001), C3 (P = 0.047) and C4 (P = 0.019). Despite the higher levels of adiposity found in DS group, no direct association was found between BF% and leptin levels, comparing with the control group. Conclusions These findings suggest that abdominal obesity should be controlled in adolescents because of its relationship with acute phase-inflammatory biomarkers but especially in DS adolescents who may show a peculiar metabolic status according to their relationship between adiposity and inflammatory biomarkers.";"[Gutierrez-Hervas, A.] Univ Alicante, Nursing Dept, Alicante, Spain; [Gutierrez-Hervas, A.; Gomez-Martinez, S.; Marcos, A.] CSIC, Inst Food Sci Technol & Nutr ICTAN, Dept Nutr & Metab DAIN, Madrid, Spain; [Izquierdo-Gomez, R.; Perez-Bey, A.; Castro-Pinero, J.] Univ Cadiz, Fac Educ Sci, Dept Phys Educ, Puerto Real, Spain; [Izquierdo-Gomez, R.] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Phys Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Veiga, O.

Method The ISRPID was produced through a virtual Delphi group with 37 professionals and relatives of people with ID from four continents and was refined in small pilot groups with persons with ID in Argentina. It has 30 items and can be self-administered or completed by a proxy. Versions in three languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) are available. Following its development, the ISRPID was applied in Chile to 705 persons with ID and to a control group of 524 college students without ID. Results Statistical analysis showed that family relationships, community participation, living arrangements and level of disability affect the experience of rights among people with ID. Importantly, with structured supports, people with ID appear able to exercise their rights to a level comparable to that of their peers without ID. Conclusions With further development, the ISRPID may be an appropriate scale to monitor the exercise of rights contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at an individual or group level.;"[Aznar, A.

Item Response Theory Approach to Differential Item Functioning;EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT;;;English;Article;;;;;;"differential item functioning; bias; SAT; item response theory; standardization approach";"STANDARDIZATION APPROACH; BIAS; MODEL; SAT";The relationship between differential item functioning (DIF) and item difficulty on the SAT is such that more difficult items tended to exhibit DIF in favor of the focal group (usually minority groups). These results were reported by Kulick and Hu, and Freedle and have been enthusiastically discussed by more recent literature. Examining the validity of the original reports of this systematic relationship is important so that we can move on to investigating more effectively its causes and the consequences associated to test score use. This article explores the hypothesis that the observed relationship between DIF and item difficulty observed in the SAT could be because of one of the following explanations: (a) the confounding of DIF and impact by the shortcomings of the standardization approach and/or (b) by random guessing. The relationship between DIF and item difficulty is examined using item response theory, which better controls for differences between impact and DIF than the standardization approach and also allows us to test the importance of guessing. The results obtained generally find evidence in support of the relationship between item difficulty and DIF suggesting that the phenomenon reported by earlier research is not a mere artifact of the statistical methodologies used to study DIF.;"[Veronica Santelices, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Wilson, Mark] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";;Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Hernando de Aguirre 959 Depto 307, Santiago, Chile.;vsanteli@uc.cl;"; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015";"WILSON, MARK R./0000-0002-0425-5305; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670";UC ACCORD;The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by UC ACCORD through a dissertation fellowship.;;56;14;14;0;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0013-1644;;;EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS;Educ.

In this work, we investigated whether gender imbalance in the participant samples of these studies may have contributed to the mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized experiments in which groups of students learning through dynamic visualizations were compared to groups receiving static visualizations. Our sample focused on tasks that could be categorized as either biologically secondary tasks (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics: STEM) or biologically primary tasks (manipulative-procedural). The meta-analysis of 46 studies (82 effect sizes and 5474 participants) revealed an overall small-sized effect (g+=0.23) showing that dynamic visualizations were more effective than static visualizations. Regarding potential moderators, we observed that gender was influential: the dynamic visualizations were more effective on samples with less females and more males (g+=0.36). We also observed that educational level, learning domain, media compared, and reporting reliability measures moderated the results. We concluded that because many visualization studies have used samples with a gender imbalance, this may be a significant factor in explaining why instructional dynamic and static visualizations seem to vary in their effectiveness. Our findings also support considering the gender variable in research about cognitive load theory and instructional visualizations.;"[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Wong, Mona] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ayres, Paul] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ, Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; wpsmona@hku.hk; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu; p.ayres@unsw.edu.au; paas@essb.eur.nl";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Wong, Mona/R-9026-2019";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Wong, Mona/0000-0002-5595-6371";PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003];Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.;;108;28;28;1;16;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

Candidate performances on both test versions were double-marked and analysed using both classical test theory and many-facet Rasch measurement. To gain an insight into students' perceptions of the two modes of delivery, we also asked candidates to complete a questionnaire after sitting each version. The many-facet Rash analysis showed no significant difference in the difficulty of the two versions of test. Nonetheless, there was a significant preference among candidates for the face-to-face version across a number of different features of the test.;"[Kormos, Judit] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist, Lancaster LA1 4YT, England; [Kiddle, Thom] Chilean British Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Kormos, J (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist, Lancaster LA1 4YT, England.;j.kormos@lancaster.ac.uk;;Kormos, Judit/0000-0002-2643-7222;;;;35;10;10;1;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;1543-4303;;;LANG ASSESS Q;Lang.

The objective was to ascertain what effects, if any, using the direct or indirect format for the operating activities section of the cash flow statement has, if any, on a loan decision and on the ratings of various attributes of the cash flow statement. Students were pretested on their accounting skills with a few simple calculations, then asked to make the loan decision and finally requested to give their opinion of the financial statements in general and of the statement of cash flows in particular. Format had only a minor effect on the loan decision itself but significantly more favorable comments on user friendliness were received on the direct format than on the indirect. Significant differences were found, however, as regards the loan decisions between the students who had correctly done the calculations and those who had not, to such a degree that the effects of in-numeracy became the main contribution to knowledge of this research. We find that the ability to perform accurate calculations, a fundamental foundation of financial numeracy, has an effect on financial decision making that has been ignored in previous studies of financial statement users and uses. This has significant implications for accounting and investing practice, and opens up an important field of research in accounting which can learn from what has already been studied on the effects of innumeracy in the health management field.;"[Donleavy, G.

Many articles have proposed predictive models in order to early detect learners at risk to alleviate this issue. Nevertheless, existing models do not consider complex high-level variables, such as self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, which can have an important effect on learners' success. In addition, predictions are often carried out in instructor-paced MOOCs, where contents are released gradually, but not in self-paced MOOCs, where all materials are available from the beginning and users can enroll at any time. For self-paced MOOCs, existing predictive models are limited in the way they deal with the flexibility offered by the course start date, which is learner dependent. Therefore, they need to be adapted so as to predict with little information short after each learner starts engaging with the MOOC. To solve these issues, this paper contributes with the study of how SRL strategies could be included in predictive models for self-paced MOOCs. Particularly, self-reported and event-based SRL strategies are evaluated and compared to measure their effect for dropout prediction. Also, the paper contributes with a new methodology to analyze self-paced MOOCs when carrying out a temporal analysis to discover how early prediction models can serve to detect learners at risk. Results of this article show that event-based SRL strategies show a very high predictive power, although variables related to learners' interactions with exercises are still the best predictors. That is, event-based SRL strategies can be useful to predict if e.g., variables related to learners' interactions with exercises are not available. Furthermore, results show that this methodology serves to achieve early powerful predictions from about 25 to 33% of the theoretical course duration. The proposed methodology presents a new approach to predict dropouts in self-paced MOOCs, considering complex variables that go beyond the classic trace-data directly captured by the MOOC platforms.;"[Manuel Moreno-Marcos, Pedro; Munoz-Merino, Pedro J.; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Delgado Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Vicu Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Av 12 Abril & Agustin Cueva, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Tolouse III Paul Sabatier, Route Narbonne, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Ave Etudiant, Toulouse, France";;Moreno-Marcos, PM (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.;"pemoreno@it.uc3m.es; pedmume@it.uc3m.es; jorge.maldonado@ucuenca.edu.ec; mar.perez@uc.cl; calario@it.uc3m.es; cdk@it.uc3m.es";"Marcos, Pedro Manuel Moreno/J-4252-2018; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/E-1678-2011";"Marcos, Pedro Manuel Moreno/0000-0003-0835-1414; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/0000-0002-2552-4674; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X";"Erasmusthorn Programme of the European Union, through the project LALA [586120-EPP-12017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/project Smartlet [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM [S2018/TCS4307]; European Structural Fund (FSE); European Structural Fund (FEDER); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, under an FPU fellowship [FPU016/00526]; CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL 2016 [21160081]; Direccion de Investigacion de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido [DIUC_XVIII_2019_54]";This work has been co-funded by the Erasmusthorn Programme of the European Union, through the project LALA (586120-EPP-12017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), by FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/project Smartlet (TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R), and by the Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM (S2018/TCS4307).

The one digital model that represents a paradigm shift is that of digital fanfiction, in which readers create spinoffs of their favorite books with different media online. Given the need for improvement in reading and writing skills among elementary schoolers, and the research supporting the objective of strengthening the link between reading and writing, the aim of this study is to propose and examine how digital tools may build on the concept of literary interactivity, in particular that of fanfiction, to provide a canvas for co-construction, so that readers may be more directly engaged with the texts they read and, as such, the narratives they build. To this end, we built a tablet-based tool for supporting third graders' incipient literacy learning through a reading-to-writing model that facilitated the multimodal co-construction of a narrative via a gaming mechanism, and maintained users' engagement during a 45-min activity. A design-based approach was used to test and hone the tool in two independent studies, involving a total of 237 third-graders. We learned that gaming mechanisms show promise for supporting narrative construction and for fostering multimodal narrative construction. In a more general sense we learned that interactive, co-constructive tools in a technological format can serve as bridges between elementary schoolers' reading and writing. Our tool in particular additionally fostered fictional storytelling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using longitudinal data (n=1,362), this study tested the extent to which mathematics self-concepts, school placement, executive functioning, and proficiency in fractions and division account for the association between mathematics achievement in first grade and at age 15. As hypothesized, a strong longitudinal association between first-grade and adolescent mathematics achievement was present (=.36) even after controlling for a host of background characteristics, including cognitive skills and reading ability. The mediators accounted for 39% of this association, with mathematics self-concept, gifted and talented placement, and knowledge of fractions and division serving as significant mediators.;"[Watts, Tyler W.; Duncan, Greg J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Chen, Meichu; Davis-Kean, Pamela E.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Claessens, Amy] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Duckworth, Kathryn] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Engel, Mimi] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA; [Siegler, Robert] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Siegler, Robert] Beijing Normal Univ, Siegler Ctr Innovat Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Susperreguy, Maria I.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Watts, TW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, 2031 Educ Bldg, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;twatts@uci.edu;"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019";"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Engel, Mimi/0000-0001-7527-1815; Davis-Kean, Pamela/0000-0001-8389-6268";"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0322356]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [HD065704 P01]; Institute of Educational Sciences [R324C100004]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [P01HD065704] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The authors are grateful to the NSF-supported Center for the Analysis of Pathways from Childhood to Adulthood (Grant 0322356), the NICHD-supported Irvine Network on Interventions in Development (Grant HD065704 P01), and the Institute of Educational Sciences (Grant R324C100004) for research support.

The identification of the different ways of conceiving, prioritising and implementing these concepts by service providers can help to drive changes to achieve better personal outcomes for this population. The current study aims to identify service providers' perceptions regarding the quality of life of their clients and the quality of services they provide. It also aims to identify similarities and differences of appraisals among professionals, and to identify associations between supports, quality of life and quality of services. Method Data were collected from 22 service providers who attended three focus groups (professionals, direct support staff, and managers) from whom 424 comments were analysed. Service providers were asked about the required support for users, the meaning of quality of life for those users, and about features that should characterise quality services. Thematic analysis was employed and transcripts of the sessions were coded according to the dimensions of models on supports, quality of life and quality of services. Chi-squared tests were utilised to test for potential differences among groups. Results Each professional group has its own priorities concerning required supports. Among the organisation different and potentially conflicting perceptions regarding the meaning of experiencing quality of life coexist. Concerning quality of services, only managers mentioned personal outcomes. Finally, institutionalisation has a negative impact on supports, quality of life and quality of services. Conclusions It is necessary to move beyond a shared awareness of the negative impact of institutionalisation towards the transformation of services in search of personal quality outcomes.;"[Jenaro, C.; Flores, N.] Univ Salamanca, Fac Psicol, INICO Inst Univ Integrac Comunidad, Salamanca 37005, Spain; [Vega, V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Pedag, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Cruz, M.] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Enfermeria, San Luis Potosi, Mexico";;Jenaro, C (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Psicol, INICO Inst Univ Integrac Comunidad, Avda Merced 109-131, Salamanca 37005, Spain.;crisje@usal.es;"Flores, Noelia/H-7492-2013; Jenaro, Cristina/H-6386-2013; Vega Cordova, Vanessa/H-6680-2013";"Flores, Noelia/0000-0001-9822-7235; Jenaro, Cristina/0000-0003-2060-1658; Vega Cordova, Vanessa/0000-0003-3333-4798; Perez Rodriguez, Ma. del Carmen/0000-0002-6514-5484";;;;48;6;6;2;26;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0964-2633;1365-2788;;J INTELL DISABIL RES;J.

There is no reliable and valid instrument for assessing QoL in people with ID in Colombia. We investigated the internal structure of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale and tested whether the scale identified the eight interrelated domains of the QoL conceptual framework originally described by. MethodData were collected from 602 adults with moderate levels of ID and respective proxies, who completed the self-report and the report by other scales, respectively. Five measurement models were tested through confirmatory factor analysis. ResultsThe eight correlated dimension model showed the best fit to the data. Reliability and convergent validity of the indicators were satisfactory in both versions of the scale (self-report and proxy report). ConclusionsThis study contributes to research on QoL measurement by providing the first empirical evidence regarding the dimensionality, internal structure and psychometric properties of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale.

To address the gap of empirical studies integrating individual, social environmental, and cultural factors, we examined how motivational factors and environmental responsiveness were jointly related to college students' creative achievement in different nations. Participants were university students from eight culturally and geographically diverse regions: Argentina, Austria, Chile, China, Kosovo, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Overall, the results painted a generally positive picture of the relationship between environmental responsiveness, motivational factors, and creative achievement. By employing structural equation modeling (SEM) and multiple-group SEM (MGSEM) methods, results partially supported the mediation role of motivational factors between environmental responsiveness and creative achievement. In addition, we observed more consistent relationships between parental responsiveness and motivational factors or creative achievement, than lecturer. This held in common across all seven countries which fulfilled the requirements for the SEM process, indicating that parents play a potential vital role in supporting students' motivational aspects and creative achievements, whereas lecturers supporting role is relative to the cultural organizational circumstances. As the first large-scale empirical study with a socio-cultural approach, we invited further discussion and proposed future cross-cultural research of this kind.

Twenty-three men were tested on two separate sessions. CMJ performance variables were obtained against three external loads (0.5-30-60 kg) using three take-off thresholds: 10 N (arbitrary value of 10 N), 5SD (mean value plus 5 standard deviations of the vertical force recorded during the flight phase), and PRF (peak difference between the vertical force trace and 0 N during the flight phase). No significant differences in reliability were observed between the three thresholds (CV and ICC values of one threshold were within 95% CI of the other thresholds). The magnitude of the variables generally differed between the 10 N threshold and the 5SD and PRF thresholds (P < .05), but not between the 5SD and PRF thresholds (P > .05).

(2017) that sensitive responsiveness as defined by Ainsworth, while not uniformly expressed across cultural contexts, is universal. Evidence presented demonstrates that none of the components of sensitive responsiveness (i.e., which partner takes the lead, whose point of view is primary, and the turn-taking structure of interactions) or warmth are universal. Mesman and colleagues' proposal that sensitive responsiveness is providing for infant needs is critiqued. Constructs concerning caregiver quality must be embedded within a nexus of cultural logic, including caregiving practices, based on ecologically valid childrearing values and beliefs. Sensitive responsiveness, as defined by Mesman and attachment theorists, is not universal. Attachment theory and cultural or cross-cultural psychology are not built on common ground.;"[Keller, Heidi] Univ Osnabruck, Osnabruck, Germany; [Bard, Kim] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Morelli, Gilda] Boston Coll, Boston, MA USA; [Chaudhary, Nandita] Univ Delhi, New Delhi, India; [Vicedo, Marga] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rosabal-Coto, Mariano] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Scheidecker, Gabriel] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Murray, Marjorie] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Gottlieb, Alma] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA";;Keller, H (corresponding author), Osnabruck Univ, Dept Human Sci, Seminarstr 20, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany.;heidi.keller@me.com;"Bard, Kim A/H-7862-2019; Rosabal-Coto, Mariano/B-9381-2016";"Bard, Kim A/0000-0002-7956-839X; Scheidecker, Gabriel/0000-0002-4461-1773";;;;53;23;24;1;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0009-3920;1467-8624;;CHILD DEV;Child Dev.;SEP-OCT;2018;89;5;;;;;1921;1928;;10.1111/cdev.13031;;;8;"Psychology, Educational; Psychology, Developmental";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Psychology;GS8CW;WOS:000443935700033;29359316;Green Submitted;;;2022-04-06;

To improve support for learners in their self-regulatory processes, researchers have proposed technological solutions to transform recorded MOOC data into actionable knowledge. However, studies providing empirical evidence on how these solutions impact learners' engagement with the course and their self-regulatory behavior remain scarce. In this article, we present the results of an observational case study in which NoteMyProgress (NMP), a web-based tool designed to support learners' self-regulation in MOOCs, is applied as an intervention in two MOOCs. The main aim of this article is to provide insights into how the support of learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies correlates with course engagement. We performed the evaluation using a sample of 263 learners and utilized distinct data sources in order to propose indicators for learners' engagement with the course and NMP. Results show a positive correlation between learners' final grades with NMP functionalities that support goal setting, organization (note taking), and self-reflection (social comparison) SRL strategies. Furthermore, we found no significant behavioral differences in how learners with low SRL and high SRL profiles engage with the course or NMP. Finally, we discuss how these results relate to prior work and the implications for future technological solutions that seek to promote engagement in MOOCs.;"[Antonio Perez-Alvarez, Ronald] Univ Costa Rica, Dept Business Comp Sci, Puntarenas 60101, Costa Rica; [Antonio Perez-Alvarez, Ronald; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Sapunar-Opazo, Diego; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Comp Sci Dept, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Sharma, Kshitij] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU Alesund, Trondheim Postboks 1517, NO-6025 Alesund, Norway; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Inst Recherce Informat Toulouse, F-31000 Toulouse, France";;Perez-Alvarez, RA (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Dept Business Comp Sci, Puntarenas 60101, Costa Rica.;"raperez13@uc.cl; jjmaldonado@uc.cl; kshitij.sharma@ntnu.no; dasapunar@uc.cl; mar.perez-sanagustin@irit.fr";Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014;"Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X; Perez Alvarez, Ronald/0000-0002-5544-0770";"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ESEPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; LALA [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2CBHE-JP]; CONICYT Doctorado Nacional [2017/21170467, 2016/21160081]; Ph.D. Student Fellowships Universidad de Cuenca, Ecuador [007-2015]; Direccion de Investigation de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under the project Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido [DIUC_XVIII_2019_54]";This work was supported in part by FONDECYT under Grant 11150231, in part by the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), MOOC-Maker under Grant 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ESEPPKA2-CBHE-JP, in part by the LALA under Grant 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2CBHE-JP, in part by the CONICYT Doctorado Nacional 2017/21170467, in part by the CONICYT Doctorado Nacional 2016/21160081, in part by the Ph.D. Student Fellowships Universidad de Cuenca, Ecuador under Grant 007-2015, and in part by Direccion de Investigation de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under the project Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido (DIUC_XVIII_2019_54).

The authors question the critical role of talk as solely providing the rich cognitive stimulation important to school success, and the critical role of primary caregivers as teachers of children's verbal competency.

That way, different services may be needed at various stages of their lifetimes. This study aimed to describe service encounters and hours of service per week for individuals with ASD in Latin American countries and compare the data from three age groups (preschoolers, school-aged, and adolescents). Methods: The data were obtained from an online survey adapted by Red Espectro Autista Latinoamerica (REAL) in 6 different South & Central American countries. The total sample was composed of 2520 caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD. Results: Service encounters for Speech, Occupational, and Behavioral Therapies decreased with patient age, while medication increased. Regardless of the age group, a large proportion of individuals (19-37 %) were not receiving treatment, and those receiving treatment got fewer hours than best practice recommendations. For adolescents, the gaps in treatment are even greater and less consistent. Discussion: Failure to offer timely identification and intervention for ASD will result in more impairment of the individual and the family burden. Although there are several initiatives to develop more resources for this population in Latin-America, the provision of services for ASD is still undervalued. Many such individuals might not be receiving the services they need, while;"[Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA Programa Argentino Ninos Adolescentes &, B1640EMQ, RA-1145 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Dept Montevideo, Bulevar Gen Artigas 1550, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Valdez, Daniel] FLACSO, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Valdez, Daniel] Univ Buenos Aires, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Dev Disorder Program, Rua Consolacao,930Consolacao, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 1058, Santiago, Chile; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Irarrazaval, Matias] Millenium Inst Res Depress & Personal, Avda Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile";;Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.;"cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu; sebastiancukier@panaacea.org; gabrielagarridof86@gmail.com; daniel.valdez@me.com; csilvestrep09@gmail.com; ricardo.garcia.sepulveda@gmail.com; analiarosolimurillo@gmail.com; matias.irarrazaval@minsal.cl; alexiarattazzi@panaacea.org";"paula, cristiane S/D-8968-2017; Montiel, Cecilia/AAP-1153-2020; Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022";"paula, cristiane S/0000-0003-0438-9407; Montiel, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Irarrazaval, Matias/0000-0002-9087-8305; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422";;;;86;5;5;0;3;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-9467;1878-0237;;RES AUTISM SPECT DIS;Res.

The current article evaluates the measurement invariance of the BMSLSS across cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study sampled 7,739 adolescents and emerging adults in 23 countries. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit of configural and partial measurement weights invariance models, indicating similar patterns and strengths in factor loading for both adolescents and emerging adults across various countries. We found insufficient evidence for scalar invariance in both the adolescents' and the emerging adults' samples. A multi-level confirmatory factor analysis indicated configural invariance of the structure at country and individual level. Internal consistency, evaluated by alpha and omega coefficients per country, yielded acceptable results. The translated BMSLSS across different cultural contexts presents good psychometric characteristics similar to what has been reported in the original scale, though scalar invariance remains problematic. Our results indicate that the BMSLSS forms a brief measure of life satisfaction, which has accrued substantial evidence of construct validity, thus suitable for use in cross-cultural surveys with adolescents and emerging adults, although evaluation of degree of invariance must be carried out to ensure its suitability for mean comparisons.;"[Abubakar, Amina; van de Vijver, Fons; He, Jia; Adams, Byron; Celenk, Ozgur; Perdomo, Cristina; Suryani, Angela] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Abubakar, Amina] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Barcelona, Spain; [Aldhafri, Said] Sultan Qaboot Univ, Muscat, Oman; [Aldhafri, Said] Bahcesehir Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arasa, Josephine] US Int Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Boer, Diana] Univ Koblenz Landau, Koblenz, Germany; [Dimitrova, Radosveta] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ferreira, Maria Cristina] Salgado Oliveira Univ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fischer, Ronald] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Fischer, Ronald] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Mbebeb, Fomba Emmanuel] Univ Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon; [Frias, Maria Teresa] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Fresno, Andres; Spencer, Rosario] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Gillath, Omri] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Harb, Charles] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; [Handani, Penny; Pandia, Weny Savitry; Suryani, Angela] Atma Jaya Catholic Univ, Jarkata, Indonesia; [Hapunda, Given] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Kamble, Shanmukh] Karnatak Univ, Dharwad, Karnataka, India; [Kosic, Marianna] Slovene Res Inst, Sci Cultural Inst Mandala, Trieste, Italy; [Looh, Joseph Lah] Univ Buea, Buea, Cameroon; [Mazrui, Lubna; Murugami, Margaret] Kenyatta Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mendia, Rafael Emilio] Univ Rafael Landivar, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Mason-Li, Mei] Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Schachner, Maja] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Sim, Samantha] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Tair, Ergyul] Bulgarian Acad Sci, BG-1040 Sofia, Bulgaria";;Abubakar, A (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Culture Studies, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;A.AbubakarAli@uvt.nl;"van de Vijver, Fons/A-4317-2012; Schachner, Maja/S-2262-2018; Kamble, Shanmukh Vasant/ABE-6993-2021; Gillath, Omri/A-8171-2009; Karakulak, Arzu/K-8481-2019; Aldhafri, Said S./A-9355-2017; Adams, Byron/H-3098-2018; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/B-5095-2011; Fischer, Ronald/G-6447-2017";"van de Vijver, Fons/0000-0003-0220-2485; Aldhafri, Said S./0000-0002-1776-263X; Adams, Byron/0000-0001-5968-1996; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/0000-0002-4638-085X; Fischer, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-3955; Gillath, Omri/0000-0001-8791-227X; kamble, shanmukh/0000-0002-2185-8052; Sembiring Pandia, Weny Savitry/0000-0002-6878-0571; Suryani, Angela Oktavia/0000-0001-5016-4802; Spencer, Rosario/0000-0002-4546-4226";;;;35;21;21;1;32;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0734-2829;1557-5144;;J PSYCHOEDUC ASSESS;J.

Increased distress and mental and medical health concerns are collateral consequences to the disease itself. The Genes to Mental Health (G2MH) Network consortium sought to understand how individuals affected by the rare copy number variations of 22q11.2 deletion and duplication syndrome, associated with neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric conditions, were coping. The article focuses on worry and disruptions in medical care caused by the pandemic. Methods The University of Pennsylvania COVID-19 Stressor List and care disruption questions were circulated by 22 advocacy groups in English and 11 other languages. Results A total of 512 people from 23 countries completed the survey; most were caregivers of affected individuals. Worry about family members acquiring COVID-19 had the highest average endorsed worry, whilst currently having COVID-19 had the lowest rated worry. Total COVID-19 worries were higher in individuals completing the survey towards the end of the study (later pandemic wave); 36% (n = 186) of the sample reported a significant effect on health due to care interruption during the pandemic; 44% of individuals (n = 111) receiving care for their genetic syndrome in a hospital setting reported delaying appointments due to COVID-19 fears; 12% (n = 59) of the sample reported disruptions to treatments; and of those reporting no current disruptions, 59% (n = 269) worried about future disruptions if the pandemic continued. Higher levels of care disruptions were related to higher COVID-19 worries (Ps < 0.005). Minimal differences by respondent type or copy number variation type emerged. Conclusions Widespread medical care disruptions and pandemic-related worries were reported by individuals with 22q11.2 syndrome and their family members. Reported worries were broadly consistent with research results from prior reports in the general population. The long-term effects of COVID-19 worries, interruptions to care and hospital avoidance require further study.";"[White, L. K.; Crowley, T. B.; Barzilay, R.; Gur, R. E.; McDonald-McGinn, D.
