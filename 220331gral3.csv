The case is based on data collected by one of the authors in Argentina. The case is appropriate for senior-level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students. Mr. Gabriel Clusellas is President of Altos de Tinogasta-La Aguadita S.A., a farming/real estate company located on 3000 hectares in the town of Tinogasta, Province of Catamarca, in Argentina. The business model Altos de Tinogasta (hence, AT) is using, and the results the company has achieved so far, are as indicated below: 1. The 3000 hectares are being planted in two crops: olives and grapes. The first harvests will be in 2013. 2. The hectares being planted in olives have been divided up into 216 parcels of 10,000 square meters each; these parcels are being offered to investors at a price of $27,000 per parcel. The hectares being planted in grapes have been divided up into 208 parcels of 2,500 square meters each; these parcels are being offered to investors at a price of $15,000 per parcel. 3. Of the 104 parcels planted in grapes so far, 81 (that is, 78%) have been sold. Of the 108 parcels planted in olives so far, 40 (that is, 37%) have been sold. However, the trend in sales is not reassuring: After a very strong performance in 2010 (a total of 71 parcels were sold that year), only 22 parcels were sold in 2011 while in the first half of 2012, only 8 parcels were sold. To continue developing its infrastructure and to continue planting additional parcels with olives or grapes, AT needs to substantially increase its revenues. 4.4. The objective Mr. Clusellas has set for the company is to generate revenues of at least $2,000,000 within the next 12 months; this would be a very substantial increase in the total revenue of approximately $500,000 generated by sales of plots in 2011. 5. Mr. Clusellas has invited Professor Carlos Aimar to develop (within 30 days) a set of alternatives for achieving the above objective, that is, that over the next 12 months, AT should generate at least $2,000,000 of revenue. Additional data and information in the case include: 1. Regarding Argentina: Historical overview, a sample of recent demographic statistics from the World Bank, (and for benchmarking purposes, comparable statistics for the United States), plus information on the economy of Argentina. 2. Regarding the company: Business model, current marketing strategy, current performance, and numerous factors impacting that performance. 3. Additional information: Information on the activities, interests, and opinions of members of the market AT has targeted, information about competing products (both domestic and international), and information about the real estate industry in Argentina. © 2013 by Jordan Whitney Enterprises, Inc, Arden NC, USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891099402

The evaluation is a process that is being studied from new angles more consciously focused on the person who learns how to learn. To assess the use of strategies during reading we have elaborated an instrument - a questionnaire aimed at evaluating the students' own cognitive and affective procedures through the reading comprehension process in a foreign language. The process of the information includes a list of skills which contains not only decoding, but also applying and extending the interpretation of the written text to other contexts, and the construction of new meaning and senses i. e. the creation of new texts. Therefore, after an exhaustive bibliographical review, four categories with their corresponding items were established: previous knowledge, translation level, interpretation level, and extrapolation level. Finally, we set up the technical characteristics of the questionnaire through statistic methods such as: Alpha of Crombach to validate its reliability, the criterion of experts and factorial analysis which confirmed its validity to evaluate the use of reading strategies in the teaching learning process of a foreign language.","Evaluation; Reading comprehension; Reading strategies",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890628281

The presence of segregation means that students are unevenly distributed throughout the system, concentrating in certain schools according to their social origin. The aim is to assess whether this process can increase educational attainment inequality. Using the PISA 2009 database, multilevel models are estimated in order to examine the effects of schoolś social composition on individual reading performance. The evidence supports the existence of significant compositional effects which help explain test score dispersion. This suggests that young people of low socioeconomic status face a double educational risk: i) an initial disadvantage related to their social and family background; and ii) a high probability of attending a school with a vulnerable student population, where they may be exposed to negative peer effects. The findings support the need to consider the social composition of schools as a key educational policy factor, and the relevance of analyzing ways to promote social inclusion in the system.","2009; Academic achievement; Argentina; Contextual effects; Educational equity; High school; Multilevel analysis; PISA; School segregation; Socioeconomic level",,"Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, NAWCAD","Funding of this research hv the Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division (NA\\'GAD) under Contract No. NOOO3P 92-(XI00 is gratefttllv acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888396615

These pioneers of elementary particle physics in Brazil were thesis advisors at the Brazilian Center of Physics Researches (CBPF), and professors at Rio de Janeiro National Faculty of Philosophy (FNFi). During the military regime of the 1960s and 1970s, a number of government decisions affected higher education institutions in Brazil. One of these determinations was specific to federal institutions of higher education in Rio de Janeiro that were grouped and incorporated to the UFRJ, and determined to transfer to the campus of the Fundão Island. These official acts, altering the teaching staff, and shifting the campuses of public universities have a long history. In the first part these Notes, we present some evidence of the attempts by Lattes in 1968 to install a research laboratory in Fundão Island. This is a little-known initiative because the files of Lattes are nowadays at UNICAMP. In the second part, we comment on the plans of José Leite Lopes at the Institute of Physics of the University of Brazil, current Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, and in particular of his proposal to build an accelerator that would be installed in the Fundão Island.

Participants were 108 children of both sexes (11.3 ± 0.4 years). They were split into two experiments involving the learning of a specific skill: (1) hit the table tennis and (2) putt golf. Both studies involved three groups of different amounts of constant practice prior to varied practice (blocked or random), and also two phases (stabilization and adaptation). Dependent variables were scores (hit the table tennis), and the number of hits the hole (golf putt). The results showed effects of task specificity because they showed the existence of an optimal amount of constant practice (prior to the varied) only for the learning of the hit the table tennis.","Learning; Motor Skill; Practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887069272

When this extended school period was implemented, it became evident that it was necessary to assess the perception and performance of first grade teachers of the nine-year Fundamental Education System in two schools of Curitiba/Paraná, focusing on methodological and relational classroom aspects. Four teachers participated in this study, of which two were private school teachers and two public school teachers. Data was collected from semi-structured interviews with the teachers, from their classroom log books, the researcher's log bookand according to the classroom observation protocol. Data was assessed based on the findings of the following authors: Zabalza (2004), Pozo (2002), Freire (1996), Arroyo (2004), Claxton (2005), and Soares (2007), to mention but a few. During the investigation, it was observed that public administration is concerned with providing theoretical and methodological subsidies for the teaching endeavors. Notwithstanding, it was noted that there are a great number of challenges in relation to the first grade of the Fundamental Education System, especially where the pedagogical practice of literacy and writing skills are concerned. Learning can only be significant in the formal learning environment, which is the school, insofar as the pedagogical practice is aligned with the characteristics and needs of the children, as well as supported by concepts that are conducive to child development and learning, all of which are factors that should impact the students' prior experiences.","First grade of the fundamental education system; Learning; Pedagogical practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886643758

The participants were 348 students from the undergraduate course in dentistry at a Brazilian public university. The instrument on work-related factors that could contribute to osteomuscular symptoms and part of the Nordic questionnaire were used. The psychometric properties of the first instrument were estimated. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that the instrument had a tri-factorial structure (s2 retained: 62.72 percent). The retained factors were repetitiveness, work posture, and external factors. The internal consistency and reproducibility were adequate (α=0.746 to 0.873; p=0.729 to 0.940). Lower mean scores of perceived external factors were observed for the male participants, as well as lower scores in the three dimensions of the instrument for first-year students of the course and for those who did not report pain/discomfort in the neck, feet, and ankles.

In particular, this study focused on conceptions of the solar system and representations of the dynamics of the solar system based on the functional and structural models that students make in school. Using a Euclidean distance-based cluster analysis, six different models of the solar system were identified. The results of this study suggest that these models do not specifically correlate to one school grade. The identified models vary in complexity, not only by the number of components but also by the dynamic interactions and distributions of the elements that comprise the models. This diversity of models shows that students do not simply reproduce the diagrams in their textbooks or the diagrams that they have access to in their environment. Though the oldest children's models approach textbook diagrams in the more complex models, up and down movements are still present in children's explanations of their models. © 2013 The American Astronomical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885930848

In parallel, Heisenberg was the first to propose noncommutative commutation relations between the components of the position operator. Such a possibility was mathematically described by Snyder, studying representations of the (4+1)-De Sitter group. A synthesis of such works is the concept of noncommutative geometry, established with the Moyal product, that arises in the Wigner formalism. In addition, such noncommutativity is found in some limits of string theory, giving rise to the possibility of measurements of spatial noncommutativity in high-energy physics. In this work, we present a pedagogical review of physical theories in noncommutative spaces, from a historical perspective. We emphasize the theory of symmetry group representations in phase space, and point out two important, but not so well-known, aspects: (a) the notion of amplitude of probability and the representation of the Schrödinger equation in phase space (usually, the phase space representation of quantum mechanics is derived from the density matrix and the Liouville-von Neumann equation); and (b) a work of Dirac in 1930, where a formulation of quantum physics was introduced by the first time. © The Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Noncommutative spaces; Quantum mechanics; Wigner functions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885466045

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out using three scientific databases and the five most important journals. Additional information was also reviewed. The search covered the period from January 2000 to December 2012. The models to measure intangibles were analyzed and compared using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Findings: The literature review shows that although such literature is still nascent and relatively scarce, there is growing interest in measuring, reporting, and managing IC for countries as a whole. NIC studies have been published in a small number of journals and more theoretical work is required. There are two main types of methods to assess and report on NIC. Despite the differences among models, their findings tend to converge. Practical implications: The information obtained contributes to the selection of models. This selection can be based on pragmatic considerations, such as the availability of data. Originality/value: There are several models to evaluate intangibles at the country level and different ways to measure them. The paper offers comparative information about the models to aid in selection for managing intangibles at the country level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assessment models; Intangibles; Intellectual capital; Intellectual capital reporting; Knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885451090

An example of the expansion of this mode of teaching is the creation in 2006 by the federal government of the Open University of Brazil (Universidade Aberta do Brasil-UAB) system in response to at least two serious problems faced by the country: low teacher qualification, and the difficulties faced by the population to gain access to higher education. Having these two needs of Brazilian education in mind, a research was carried out seeking to answer the following question:considering the DE in the pedagogy licentiateship courses at the UAB system of the State University of Ceardea ́ (UAB/UECE), how does teacher education contribute to the exercise of the teaching profession? The work has as an objective to identify what is the education background of teachers working at the pedagogy licentiateship at UAB/UECE. For that, the methodology adopted the survey as a research method. The instrument used was an online questionnaire sent by electronic mail and created through the use of a free piece of software called LimeSurvey. The research samplewas taken randomly and was composed of 47 teachers out of a population of 90 teachers. The results show that there is a still a large number of teachers without specific training in DE to work in the course.

Subject area: – A consulting team to an international food packaging company (SDYesBox) is attempting to decide which algorithm is the most useful for selecting two national markets in Central America and the Caribbean. SDYesBox wants to work closely with its immediate customers – manufacturers in the dairy and food industry and their customers (retailers) – to develop and market innovative products to low-income consumers in emerging markets; the “next big opportunity for the dairy industry” according to SDYesBox. Study level/applicability: – New product development and market selection in emerging markets in Latin America. Case overview: – Five algorithms are “on the table” for assessing 14 countries by 12 performance indicators: weighted-benchmarking each country by the country leader's indicator scores; tallying by ignoring indicator weights and selecting the countries having the greatest number of positive standardized scores; applying a conjunctive and lexicographic combination algorithm; and using a “fluency metric” of how quickly consumers can say each country aloud. At least one member of the consulting team is championing one of these five algorithms. Which algorithm do you recommend? Why? Expected learning outcomes: – Learners gain skills, insights, and experience in alternative decision tools for evaluating and selecting choices among emerging markets to enter with new products for low-income (bottom of the pyramid) products ands services.

The theory and methodology of this study are based on Social Literacy New Studies and propose an analysis of documented data concerning the introduction of the nine-year elementary school. The data of the results reveal that the initiative to increase Brazilian students' education is important, but beyond increased schooling, it does not establish a clear strategy that schools should implement at this grade level. The documents describe treating literacy as a social practice, but do not specify that literacy is a part of the broader social literacy. Therefore, the schools need to identify the relationship between phonemic-graphemes and graphemes-phonemic in literacy to create an effective strategy for the social practice of writing. Further, the documents reveal our students' insufficient knowledge about the culture of writing.","Educational politics; Literacy; Nine-year elementary school",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890854716

Finally, it attempts to assess the developments of this strange notion of governmentality within the English-Speaking intellectual world and its relations to present times. The interview has taken place during Colin Gordon's visit to Brazil for the ""International Seminar Max Weber and Michel Foucault: possible convergences"" (May, 2013). It aims to revisit the context in which the governmentality studies have appeared as a specific field of interest and research, in order to put in perspective the progressive spread of this field since the appearance, in 2004, of both Foucault's lectures at Collége de France (Security, Territory, Population and The Birth of Biopolitics) where the notion is introduced. The possibility to know Colin Gordon's ideas about these themes seemed timely not only because of the range of governmentality studies in education in Brazil (something that can be testified by the number of articles, thematic issues and books that are appearing since the 1990s), but also because of the manner in which the notion of governmentality has been taken by the post-colonial studies. In this sense, the notion still seems to be a very useful tool to confront the task of understanding the problems and problematizations that constitute the specificity of our Brazilian modernity.","Governmentality; Governmentality studies; Michel foucault; Political culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890848077

The purpose of this paper is to think about the schooling prescribed and instituted in an incarcerated context, based on a contextualized analysis of representations of prisoners from the prison of Uberlandia (MG). The aim is to contribute with the understanding of the limits and possibilities of school education in the prisons. Utilizing a qualitative and participative method of research, whose core is a bibliographical, documental and field investigation, the paper intends to problematize the official speech and the reality faced by the prisoners. The research subjects were selected at random, based on security criteria set by the prison's head office. Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and a focus group. The results achieved show that the current scenario of schooling in the prisons has several fragilities, not only because it reaches a small number of prisoners in Brazil but mainly because the possibility of having an effective educational action in the prisons is sustained, above all, by the personal commitment of teachers, prison agents and technical staff involved in the task.

Secondly, I describe and discuss, from my own practice, a lesson using dynamic tools for helping prospective teachers to understand the relationship between integration and differentiation within the context of the current literature from Mexico and abroad. While Mexico faces distinct issues within its educational system, challenges in how future mathematics teachers understand mathematical content appear universal. Thus, teaching mathematical content while modelling effective mathematical pedagogical practices is of relevance to all of us striving to enhance the quality of future mathematics teachers. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","dynamic software; education; fundamental theorem of calculus; GeoGebra; Mexico; research",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885958410

After discussing the basic aims of educating cities, the paper focuses on the Latin American experience, giving examples of existing projects within the educating cities initiative. The authors are particularly interested in the contrast between the political intentions of educating cities on the one hand and the social, economic, political and cultural world on the other hand. They observe that in this context there is a danger of the individual being forgotten, which contradicts the actual intention of the educating city concept.

In the PNLD teacher's guide, only in the analysis of some textbooks is there clear information on calculator usage in the classroom. Calculator usage is mainly encouraged in the textbooks of the final years in primary school, mostly with multiplication and division, and distributed in four types of activities: conceptual development, verification of results, results calculation and calculator tool manipulation. Many textbooks have considered the recommendation to use modern technological devices to aid the learning of mathematics, while others still have to assess the value of the calculator as a valid instrument in developing mathematical knowledge. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884138700

On the basis of the interpretative framework, an analysis is made of an excerpt of a regular elementary school class, a school level at which explicit mathematics reasoning rarely arises. The paper contends that teachers and students use schemes based on reasons in order to make mathematical statements credible, but that they also resort-perhaps unconsciously-to epistemic schemes that are governed by extra-rational considerations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Classroom analysis; Mathematics convincement",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880814953

Schools are a promising setting but to date it is unclear how many school-based obesity interventions have been documented in Latin America and what level of evidence can be gathered from such interventions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of papers published between 1965 and December 2010. Interventions were considered eligible if they had a school-based component, were done in Latin America, evaluated an obesity related outcome (body mass index [BMI], weight, %body fat, waist circumference, BMI z-score), and compared youth exposed vs not exposed. RESULTS: Ten studies were identified as having a school-based component. Most interventions had a sample of normal and overweight children. The most successful interventions focused on prevention rather than treatment, had longer follow-ups, a multidisciplinary team, and fewer limitations in execution. Three prevention and 2 treatment interventions found sufficient improvements in obesity-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We found sufficient evidence to recommend school-based interventions to prevent obesity among youth in Latin America. Evidence-based interventions in the school setting should be promoted as an important component for integrated programs, policies, and monitoring frameworks designed to reverse the childhood obesity in the region. © 2013, American School Health Association 83 9 September 2013 10.1111/josh.12080 GENERAL ARTICLE GENERAL ARTICLES Published 2013.

In this study we explore the learning problems that are engendered in children through the use of a language other than their mother tongue in school. A test was conducted in Spanish and Ch?ol, with ten items that focused on linguistic and cultural identity, logic, mathematics, Spanish, history, geography and geometry. Three possible answers were offered, only one of which was correct. The test was administered to 53 fifth-grade children and the same number of sixth-grade students in the Indigenous Education Schools of the Ch?ol region. Between 50 and 70% of the students in both grades obtained six or seven correct answers in both languages. The results suggest that there is a deficiency in the level of knowledge and while we conclude that language does not appear to be a major limitation to learning, nevertheless we cannot rule out that the use of the mother tongue as a means of communication during teaching processes could facilitate meaningful learning.","Bilingualism; Cognitive understanding; Intercultural education; Measurement of knowledge; School performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish; English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882593542

Variables were characterized by descriptive statistics and the comparison between phases was performed by the Student's t-test (p <0.05). Results: the maximum velocities and accelerations of the ankle, knee and hip were lower than found in literature, resulting in slower execution of the karate kick. The velocities and accelerations of the ankle, knee and hip of the attack phase were statistically higher than in the return phase of the kick. It is concluded that the attack phase is faster and more offensive than the return phase, being the variable time important in the implementation of the semicircular kick.","Biomechanics; Karate; Kinematics; Semicircular kick",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882361818

The theoretical framework for the study consists in an ethnomathematics perspective developed in dialogue with ideas from the later works of Wittgenstein and with those of Foucault. From the latter, the main notion utilized here is that of governmentality. The research material includes documents made available by the EAP and questionnaires filled by teachers responsible for formation courses in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The analysis discloses a tension between the pedagogical guidelines offered to teachers and the activities proposed to the pupils in the area of mathematics, and also that the program steers the conduct of teachers, pupils and, more broadly, of the local population. By regulating this population, the program works as a government device that institutes a depoliticized and romantic view of the countryside, trivializes the need for theorization in the conception of educative processes, and situates life in the countryside at a level inferior to that of urban life. This is expressed in a more specific way in the mathematical education, particularly in geometry: strategies are put in motion by EAP in order to reinforce this hierarchizing process, which ultimately is a process of (re)production of inequalities. Therefore, the urban and country populations are signified not only as different, but as unequal.","Escola Ativa Program; Governmentality; Mathematical education; Multi-seriated country schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881621720

Taking this reality into account and the difficulties that many students present in the resolution of exercises involving graphs, the objective of the present research was to propose and investigate an alternative approach to teaching this content, using the software Graphmatica. We developed a pedagogical intervention with 150 third-year high school students in which we used the pedagogical material presented in this paper. Students took a test composed of university entry exam items that allows us to check their learning through this approach, since the percentage of right items was satisfactory.

We noted that, in their first steps into DL, teachers barely used technological resources that typically assist in participants' interactions, and sometimes their practice reflected their face-to-face teaching. Mediations were perceived from the perspective of Activity Theory. This theory studies the subject in activity and their incorporation of new artifacts into their practice, which was constantly changing.

First, we explore the situation in Argentina, where the relationship between the university and society is being redefined. A new form of knowledge transfer to society, focused especially on social movements, is currently being carried out by different programmes at public universities. Second, the Brazilian experience is characterised by the creation of a number of new universities that are attempting to transform the social role of the traditional model of extension programmes to serve local, regional and international development. We contend that as the traditional university approaches to its 1000th anniversary, it urgently requires a radical transformation. The origins and expansion of neoliberal policies of higher education in Mexico constitute the third case in point, in which we argue that the role of international agencies is a key element in the creation and consolidation of the common sense associated with neoliberalism in higher education policies. The experiences and processes discussed in this article constitute important aspects that show the way in which universities and various actors within them can take part in the struggle to resist the consolidation of neoliberal policies in Latin American higher education. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","common sense; higher education; Latin America; neoliberalism",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879646242

Considering that the Brazilian government has been active in trying to include everyone, without exception, to study hearing impairment in the Brazilian educational context means, necessarily, studying the inclusive education proposal and questioning the challenges and perspectives derived from this proposal. This study developed through a quantitative approach and its objective was to map and to determine the number students with hearing impairments enrolled at municipal and state elementary schools of a medium size city in the state of São Paulo, according to data from the Secretaria Municipal de Educação and the Diretoria de Ensino Estadual. These statistics do not conform to the information provided by Microdados do Censo Escolar da Educação Básica, available for the year 2010 from the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP). We argue that in order to provide appropriate policies for educating deaf students, it is necessary to know where these students are enrolled and how many there are. Whether at the municipal, state or national level, these data have not been considered. The study was conducted following two stages: a documentary stage and data analysis. There was wide discrepancy in the data coming from different sources that should have provided the same information. The inclusion of students with deafness in regular schools is a constant and permanent challenge. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to discussions in the field of Special Education, especially to studies related to deaf education, since providing quality education for these students is related to issues such as the number of enrollments. We consider that the data presented in this study is indicative of the way the issue of deaf education has been proposed, suggesting opportunities for revision and orientation regarding acknowledgment and registration of students, such as the deaf students that are enrolled in the public education system.

The aim of this work is to develop a didactic and easy-to-use computational tool in the NEURON simulation environment, which allows graphical visualization of both the passive and active conduction parameters and the geometric characteristics of a cylindrical axon with HH properties. Results: The SENB software offers several advantages for teaching and learning electrophysiology. First, SENB offers ease and flexibility in determining the number of stimuli. Second, SENB allows immediate and simultaneous visualization, in the same window and time frame, of the evolution of the electrophysiological variables. Third, SENB calculates parameters such as time and space constants, stimuli frequency, cellular area and volume, sodium and potassium equilibrium potentials, and propagation velocity of the action potentials. Furthermore, it allows the user to see all this information immediately in the main window. Finally, with just one click SENB can save an image of the main window as evidence.

However, what might count as the context still needs in-depth discussion. In order to contribute to the development of a theoretical framework for understanding mathematics teachers' professional lives, we will draw on one remarkable teacher's identity as a primary mathematics teacher in relation to one political, sociocultural, and pedagogical context.

Traditionally, detection and diagnosis of these children takes place when these difficulties are already evident and are expressed as general learning problems. Unfortunately, little attention is paid to evaluating psychological aspects at preschool age, which from the perspective of historical-cultural theory help prevent later learning difficulties at school. The aim of the present paper is to assess the level of acquisition of previous mathematical abilities in Mexican rural and urban children. 77 preschool children were selected as participants of the study. They were evaluated using the ""Protocol of psychological assessment of school readiness"" (Quintanar & Solovieva, 2003). The Protocol assesses the consolidation of previous mathematical skills through one-to-one correspondence tasks, seriation, and comparison of conjunctions and concrete concepts, among others. The results show that the assessed groups failed to show elementary logic skills. We underline the need to analyze these aspects of psychological development at preschool age, as future school difficulties are related to an absence of proper-guided activities at preschool centres. © 2013 Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Historical-cultural paradigm of development; Intellectual development; Mathematical abilities; New formations of preschool age; Preschool age; Psychological assessment",,"Institute of Infection and Immunity","Tarea: “Dibujo”.

In the studies included in the dossier, qualitative features of psychological development during preschool and early school age are described, and children's difficulties and development possibilities are analyzed with some specific proposals for educational practice. All the studies include empirical data obtained through the administration of either psychological assessment tools or developmental programmes. Such aspects of development as: the relationship between historical-cultural psychology and neuropsychology, internal and egocentric language, symbolic function, play activity as a form of preschool development, and acquisition of initial mathematic abilities are taken into account.

This model assumes the obliquity of the ecliptic as constant, the light beams as parallels, the Earth as spherical, the movement of translation of Earth as uniform circular. Also, this model showed a context of the astronomy whereby the teachers can teach the basic physics. It was built through a relationship between the movement of translation and of rotation of the wave front light, then we found the illumination zone on the Earth, and the illumination time is estimated in a particular latitude with the uniform circular movement of Earth. The present model was confronted with the numerical results of the Geoscience Australia Agency and it is found a maximum percent error of 1; 6%, which was due primarily to the difference between the circular trajectory, in this model, and the real elliptical trajectory. Without the use of spherical trigonometry, it was obtained an analytical model that estimates very close the solar illumination time at any time of the year and at any latitude on Earth.

To this end, it delves into a rarely explored empirical observation: financial resource transfers from national universities to the National Scientific and Technological Research Council (CONICET, for its Spanish acronym) during that period. The intention is to show how, by reallocating funds geared to Science and Technology, CONICET was made to expand and decentralize to the detriment of universities. This was the primary tool used by the military regime to thwart higher education's research development, bolstering research efforts at other realms. Thus, CONICET grew in budget, number of researchers, and staff size, creating new research institutes, while national universities struggled with reduced funding and were forced to shut down their institutes and programs. As a result, CONICET virtually concentrated all scientific research, foregoing the knowledge accumulated at universities, which drove a wedge between both institutions. This military approach to science and technology policy-making is discussed, bearing in mind the notion of dependence-both in terms of the state's intervention in the inner workings of the scientific-university field as well as regarding the role played by international financial support in scientific research development. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Military dictatorship; National Council for Scientific and Technological Research; National universities; Scientific field",,"Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica, Gobierno de Argentina, CNEA; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Consejo Nacional para Investigaciones Científicas y Tecnológicas, CONICIT; Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria, INTA; Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, AECS; INTI International University and Colleges, INTI","In Argentina, the state’s funding for scientific research at public institutions is allocated by the ‘Technical and Scientific Budget Program.’2 This ‘program’ supports a number of research institutions, including Public Universities (UN, for its acronym in Spanish), the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), the National Industrial Technology Institute (INTI), the National Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA), the National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET), and the Armed Forces’ Research and Development Military System (SMID), among others.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878115666

However, most of the research has been done with children beyond the ages of early childhood. This could be due to the common and erroneous belief that young children have not developed the capacity to work collaboratively toward a given aim. In this paper we show how small group co-located collaborative learning on a single display computer improves oral language, logical-mathematical and social skills in pre-school children. Considering that early childhood teachers have a responsibility to provide a supportive environment, teacher mediation is essential in order to achieve collaborative learning. Thus, teachers were trained in the use of the technology and strategies for effective collaborative learning. The study was implemented in 10 kindergarten classrooms with 268 children between the ages of 5 and 6 years old. A group of 5 kindergarten classrooms with equivalent characteristics participated as a comparison group. During the four-month intervention, children worked on collaborative activities at least twice a week. A quasi-experimental approach was used to assess the implementation, including pre- and post-testing.

The navigation problem consists of the four subproblems: world perception, path planning, path generation, and path tracking. This software based on ant colonies has two operational modes: virtual and on-line. In virtual mode, is able to achieve path generation, path planning and virtual path tracking at once, since the virtual mobile robots ""ants"" searches for the objective point generating feasible paths, then generate a set of subgoals to obtain the optimal path, since the optimal path was obtained using a cost function that considers the robot architecture, the optimal trajectory for the robot also is obtained. In on-line mode, the robot is able to sense the world using stereoscopic vision, the map is updated using epipolar geometry, and the on-line navigation problem is handled similar to the virtual mode. The software has many educational skills, since students can learn about path generation, optimal planning and path tracking using the heuristic methodology known as Ant Colony Optimization that recently has had good acceptance for solving discrete optimization planning problems. The platform is also a good tool to learn about stereoscopic vision and epipolar geometry that is one of the best sensing methods in mobile robotics. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ant Colony Optimization; autonomous mobile robot navigation; Fuzzy Logic; path planning; Simple Tuning Algorithm","Autonomous Mobile Robot; Discrete optimization; Navigation problem; Navigation software; Optimal trajectories; Robot architecture; Stereoscopic vision; Tuning algorithm; Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy logic; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Robotics; Students; Navigation",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876138034

This exercise has been presented to Chemical Engineering students to help them relate concepts learned in class and the use of software tools widely available in the practice of engineering. The unit, composed of three distillation columns, is simulated using the equilibrium model and the Peng-Robinson equation of state; it is solved using a multiple-step initialization and the Inside-Out algorithm. An analysis of the system's degrees of freedom is made in order to specify a base case that is used as the starting point for the optimization. The maximization of the stabilized gasoline flow is achieved through the use of the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SPQ) algorithm.

In order to initiate the conceptions reorganization, an initial activity was made in the graphic frame; it seems optimal to start the debates without leading participants to failure. The mathematical core of the workshop was formed by an algebraic method to find tangents to algebraic curves which is close to Descartes' method. The ACODESA methodology allowed some intense debates mainly concerning the local character of a tangent, generating the teachers' cognitive unbalance which is a starting point for the refinement or transformation of their conceptions. On the other hand, the cK¢ model allows to understand the conceptions of participants and to analyze the evolution of their knowings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","ACODESA methodology; Algebraic curve; Conceptions; Knowing; Tangent line",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874761981

In the first study, we investigated the cognitive performance of students with low and typical achievement in mathematics and language. In the second study, we developed an ANN to classify mathematics school achievement. Finally, we tested the adequacy of this network to classify an unknown sample to the ANN. Most of the performance differences in the battery were related to mathematics achievement. The ANN was able to predict mathematics achievement with acceptable accuracy and presented equivalent results in a simulation involving a different sample.

The theoretical framework was based on assessment, youth and adult education and evening class literature. It also considered the complexity of students' social relations inside and outside schools. The research took into consideration learning difficulties in mathematics and the constant threat of repetition and dropout. Results indicated that the promotion of learning among youth and adults - who enter (or return) to high school - depends on the search for pedagogical approaches that are flexible and can consider the previous experiences and expectations they bring to school.

Aims: This work aimed at measuring longitudinally academic motivation, anxiety, depression and social adjustment in first-year medical students and determining the relationships between these variables and academic performance, as measured mainly by grades on regular exams. Methods: Eighty-five first-year medical students (age: 17-25 years) were included after giving informed consent. Beck's Anxiety (BAI) and Beck's Depression (BDI) Inventories, the self-reported Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR) and the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) were applied two months after admission and at the end of the academic year. Results: BAI scores increased throughout the year (7.3±6.6 versus 28.8±6.7; p<0.001), whereas BDI scores did not change (6.8±5.9 versus 6.0±5.4; p>0.10). SAS-SR subscales scores remained stable, except for a decreasing pattern for leisure/social life (1.8±0.4 versus 2.1±0.4; p<0.001). AMS scores for motivation to know (22.2±4.5 versus 19.7±5.5; p<0.001), to accomplish things to know (17.7±5.3 versus 15.4±5.3; p=0.001), to experience to know (18.2±5.2 versus 15.4±5.4; p<0.001) and by identification to know (23.5±3.5 versus 21.8±5.0; p=0.002) decreased significantly. There were no significant correlations between academic performance and the global scores for any of the scales except for the SAS-SR subscale for academic life (r=-0.48, p<0.001). Conclusions: Throughout the academic year, first-year medical students showed increased anxiety, decreased academic motivation and a maladjusted leisure/social life, which however does not seem to affect academic achievement. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.",,"adult; anxiety; article; depression; education; female; human; leisure; male; medical education; medical student; motivation; psychological aspect; social adaptation; socioeconomics; statistics; anxiety; depression; medical student; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Motivation; Social Adjustment; Socioeconomic Factors; Students, Medical; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Motivation; Social Adjustment; Socioeconomic Factors; Students, Medical","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Ministério da Educação, MEC","FM, MM, TLR and FPV were supported by scholarship from the ‘Programa de Educac¸ão Tutorial do Ministério da Educac¸ão’ (PET/MEC).

To further validate their initial findings, in 2012, the authors conducted an online survey of engineering students and engineers. The main conclusion is that engineering students will benefit from learning more about the impact of emotions, culture, diversity and cognitive biases when solving problems. Specifically, the work shows that an augmented problem-solving curriculum needs to include lessons on labelling emotions and cognitive biases, 'evidence-based' data on the importance of culture and diversity and additional practice on estimating conditional probability. © 2013 Copyright SEFI.","cognitive biases; conditional probability; culture and diversity; emotional blocks; problem solving","Cognitive bias; Cognitive science; Conditional probabilities; emotional blocks; Engineering curriculum; Interpersonal intelligence; Social psychology; Teaching problems; Artificial intelligence; Problem solving; Teaching; Curricula",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876297651

The former educates childhood to transform it into what it ought to be. The latter does not form childhood, but makes education childlike. To unfold the philosophical and pedagogical dimensions of this opposition, the first part of the paper highlights the way in which philosophy is presented indirectly in some of Plato's dialogues, beginning with a characterisation that Socrates makes of himself in the dialogue Phaedrus. The second part details Plato's condemnation of writing in the Phaedrus, and draws on the critique by Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze to establish what is at stake in this condemnation. In the third part, the pedagogical and political implications of this condemnation are reviewed, and Plato is placed in a surprising position in relation to his own teacher, Socrates. Finally, through a comparison between childhood and philosophy, the educational value of putting childhood and philosophy together is questioned. Through a number of questions, the paper ends problematising the pedagogical, political and philosophical value of placing the practice of philosophy in the realm of childhood citizenship education. It also recovers the value of philosophy-as a form of questioning and unlearning what we know and affirming the value of not knowing-in a childlike education. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Childhood; Pharmakon; Philosophizing; Plato; Socrates; Writing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876085085

From this, we propose to discuss how future teachers of the discipline interpret mathematical rules they will teach in basic education. For this, we performed a study with students in a graduation course in mathematics in the final stages of training. On the occasion, we required undergraduates to describe how they would teach some mathematical operations, justifying its validity. We found that these undergraduates do not have clarity of mathematical operations that they will have to teach and that some of their mistakes are the same the basic education students. Our theoretical framework is composed mainly by the ideas of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein - that discusses learning and applying rules -, the ideas of the French (re)educator Stella Baruk that discusses, among other things, about the apparent connection between mathematics and magic, as well as other studies that discuss teacher training.","Basic education; Language; Mathematical rules; Teachers of mathematics; Training and teaching practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875475846

It was observed the success of the Action Projects with regard to various aspects evaluated during its planning and execution, as follows: promoting learning beyond the classroom; the perception of the importance to perform group activities, building study groups and applying what was learnt in workshops, both in the construction, production and use of technological resources as in the solidary economy; promoting the appropriation of cultural property, offered by counties and state, by young learners with consequent awareness that this access is a right for all; and, in special, fostering to the interest of the learners for the school activities in order to make them feel co-responsible for their learning. As the result it is seen no temporary school dropouts and a 37% reduction in the number of sporadic absences by students of the Specialization Course. A reflection on the educational activities addressed in this article is the result of a compilation of nine projects developed in a course focusing on youths present in the YAE. This effort is subjected to a liberating theoretical and methodological approach, according to the searched principles, especially at Paulo Freire, which gives it academic rigor and quality.

I examine some aspects of how youths and adults acquire mathematical knowledge and tools, both through elementary-education programs and through engaging in occupations that do not require much schooling. I focus on the concept of proportionality because it cuts across elementary education, it serves as a base for more advanced mathematics, and it is an asset for work and for interaction in different fields of social activity. I explain how the Mexican educational system fails to accomplish one of its fundamental obligations: to ensure that the people it serves obtain the symbolic tools that are necessary for enhancing their mathematical thinking, and their ways of relating to the world. I also explain how some occupational and commercial activities contribute to people's development of mathematical knowledge and skills that are useful for dealing with problems that emerge in specific contexts.

We also aimed to identify the influence of the culture of performativity in the work of these teachers. We interviewed the coordinator, supervisor and four high school teachers from the institution investigated. Our research showed that the most valued skills are directly influenced by the need to obtain good results in internal and external evaluations. The most valued skills were time management, keeping up to date with external evaluations and relating well to students. Another aspect we noticed about the management team was how the faculty aimed to ensure that their students were prepared for the most competitive entrance examinations in the country.","Culture of performativity; Large-scale evaluations; Mathematics education; Mathematics teacher education; Professional skills",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883566762

This is the situation with regard to fiction texts. According to Lajolo (1997), literature is the radar and mirror of the values, emotions, feelings and point of view of societies. Therefore we can pose questions to literary texts to seek historical narratives. In this paper, parts of the literary texts Novelas Paulistanas and Memórias de um Sargento de Milícias have led us to historical research in secondary sources.

This theme merits investigation because of the policies implemented by the Federal Government Access to Higher Education that aim to increase the level of schooling for the population, i.e. ProUni, REUNI and FIES. Eleven higher education institutions of Juiz de Fora were surveyed, of which ten were private and one public. The interviewees were the supervisors of courses in which self-declared students with disabilities were enrolled, and attended regularly, at the time when data was collected. Subsequently, the interviews were analyzed by content analysis. The data showed that there are currently 45 students with disabilities enrolled who regularly attend classes in higher education courses in the city. The private institutions represent 82.2% of this total and the federal public university includes 17.8%. It is deemed greatly relevant to implement further studies that aim to increase information about the inclusion of people with disabilities in the Brazilian school system. This will enable better understanding of these students' process of facing difficulties, advocacy struggles and overcoming barriers until they achieve entrance into the university.

However, it is hard to find tools that can be used to provide clear feedback in developing such research. In this paper, we present the results of using a heuristic tool called heuristic diagram (HD), previously designed by the authors and based on Gowins heuristic Vee, to formatively assess in-service teachers research skills. Two different groups of science and mathematics in-service teachers in a Research Methods Course completed four different HD about their research project throughout the semester. We performed a general analysis based on a scoring rubric of these HD in order to show how teachers research skills were developed throughout the course. Teachers also evaluated their experience of using the HD through a semantic differential analysis and answered an open questionnaire about the advantages and difficulties of using such tool. Overall, the HD seems to be useful to formatively assess research skills because it allows teachers to make their theoretical framework explicit, relate it to the research question and to the methods used to answer it in an integrated and short way. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","In-service teacher education; research skills; teacher researchers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878601680

This reform was accompanied by the creation or expansion of many agencies to support research, both on federal and state levels. Among these agencies are two within the Ministry of Science and Technology: the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), that provides scholarships and resources for individual research projects, and the Studies and Projects Finance Organization (FINEP), intended to finance large-scale projects, infrastructure and innovation. The Ministry of Education incorporates the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education (CAPES), which provides graduate scholarships and evaluates graduate study programs in Brazil.","There are also state agencies that support research and offer scholarships. One important example is São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). The State of São Paulo produces roughly 50% of the published papers and is responsible for 45% of the PhD theses of the country. In São Paulo, the constitution establishes that 1% of the state final revenues belong to FAPESP. This funding model gives the foundation stability and autonomy to a level not duplicated elsewhere in Latin America. In 2011, FAPESP received around $530 million from public revenues and 20,600 research proposals. Projects chosen for funding were selected by a peer-review system. The average turnaround time for a proposal was 74 days and the overall success rate 45%. Other states in Brazil have similar foundations.

This traditional model may turn elementary-level lessons into an extremely theoretical, boring and non-effective process. In this context, research in mathematics elementary education in Mexico indicates the need to analyze alternative pedagogic practices and to find different ways to make mathematics education in early ages less difficult and more attractive. Constructivist theory can provide an alternative for developing pedagogic proposals. The objectives of this research were: (1) develop a computational platform to support the traditional Mexican method of education with practical mathematics problems simulated as part of the daily world environment and to increase the level of students' social involvement through direct collaboration, and (2) analyze how this computational tool affects student motivation, collaboration and discussion. An exploratory case study concerning dimensions of mathematics problem-solving using computer simulations was conducted with 6-8 year old elementary school children. After a theoretical class the children were involved in solving a series of verbal problems, using our computational platform. Sixty third-grade children participated in this case study and data were collected from their responses to questions and interviews in order to explore attitudes toward learning mathematics and assess self-efficacy in this area. The results obtained in this research indicate that the integration of computational tools into conventional method courses provides elements to improve student motivation, collaboration and discussion based on their own exploratory experiences. These results can assist other education programs to incorporate positive attitudes and their own knowledge creation from a constructivist approach using technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Plural marked forms exhibit increased frequency in this period, reversing earlier trends toward loss or stability in a development typical of flows and counterflows in the community. The directionality of most structural and social dimensions does not change, but age patterns shift. Our aim is to investigate how groups of speakers evolve over time. Comparison of same-age groups at different moments does not yield insight and is not conducive to apprehending patterns of evolution because speakers move from one age group to another. We set up age cohorts so as to sample virtually the same universes. Examining age cohorts, we see increased frequency of number concord, although the original pattern of relative usage is preserved. Speakers are on the move, but constrained by social patterns in which they are situated. The pattern is broken precisely by those who were not in it, the unborn in the 1980s, who reverse direction dramatically toward increased usage of concord. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875619437

User generated content often takes the form of short texts (e. g., blog posts, news feeds, snippets, etc). This has motivated an increasing interest on the analysis of short texts and, specifically, on their categorisation. Text categorisation is the task of classifying documents into a certain number of predefined categories. Traditional text classification techniques are mainly based on word frequency statistical analysis and have been proved inadequate for the classification of short texts where word occurrence is too small. On the other hand, the classic approach to text categorization is based on a learning process that requires a large number of labeled training texts to achieve an accurate performance. However labeled documents might not be available, when unlabeled documents can be easily collected. This paper presents an approach to text categorisation which does not need a pre-classified set of training documents. The proposed method only requires the category names as user input. Each one of these categories is defined by means of an ontology of terms modelled by a set of what we call proximity equations. Hence, our method is not category occurrence frequency based, but highly depends on the definition of that category and how the text fits that definition. Therefore, the proposed approach is an appropriate method for short text classification where the frequency of occurrence of a category is very small or even zero. Another feature of our method is that the classification process is based on the ability of an extension of the standard Prolog language, named Bousi~Prolog, for flexible matching and knowledge representation. This declarative approach provides a text classifier which is quick and easy to build, and a classification process which is easy for the user to understand. The results of experiments showed that the proposed method achieved a reasonably useful performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ontologies; Text categorization; Thesauri; Unlabeled short texts",,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: PEIC09-0196-3018, PII1I09-0117-4481, TIN2007-67494, TIN2010-20395; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","Acknowledgments This research was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MEC) under TIN2007-67494 and TIN2010-20395 projects and by the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha under PEIC09-0196-3018 and PII1I09-0117-4481 projects",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874753376

In the first phase of the project, the central organizing ideas of 14 numeration systems were specified. Each system belonged to a different Mesoamerican language. Three aspects of the systems were identified that would have to be accounted for in instructional design. They include using 20 as a multiplicative base.

The explanatory schemata resulting from this standardization tend to destroy individualism and enchantment.

And that is what mathematics education is all about: make the human subject grow intellectually and as a person by means of mathematics. At first sight, mathematics, in its formal guise, seems the opposite of philosophy, because philosophy constructs concepts (meanings), whereas mathematics deals with extensions of concepts (sets). We shall, however, turn this problem into an instrument, using the complementarity of intensions and extensions of theoretical terms as our main device for discussing the relationship between philosophy and mathematics education.

A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 117 elderly or older adults, mostly female (78%), married (53%), retired (82%), and aged on average 65.32. Data collection tools included a questionnaire and a socio-demographic chart of the instrument called Map of Minimum Relationships of the Elderly. These data were entered into the Epidata version 3.1 and the SPSS 17.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Most participants had medium-sized support networks, characterized by 16.80 people who could assist them throughout the year with some of the listed activities (visits, keeping company, helping with household chores, personal care assistance, and financial aid). When the sample was stratified by age, it was found that older subjects had a smaller social network. Individuals in stable relationships had a greater social support network than did single individuals. The variables age and income were correlated with the size of the social support network. According to these correlations, the greater their age, the fewer the social interactions they enjoyed. Alternatively, the higher the family income of respondents, the greater the number of members in their social support network. The results suggest that social support networks shrink along the process of aging, although some variables such as income and marital status act as modulating factors, thus contributing to its continuation or to its steeper decline. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"02/2009 – INEP/MEC","This is a prospective study to identify the characteristics and benefits derived from attending an Open University for Senior Citizens.

The study concludes that, in vulnerability contexts, the process of construction of mathematical knowledge is detached from the student's cultural capital.

It is necessary to investigate factors beyond the school campus and into the neighborhoods that surround schools. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the density of tobacco retailers and the illegal tobacco sales rate within school neighborhoods and smoking behaviors among students. Methods: This study utilized secondary data from the baseline of the Youth Tobacco Access Project. Data were collected from 10,662 students attending 21 middle schools and 19 high schools, in addition to 512 tobacco retailers, all within 24 towns in Illinois during 2002. A random-effects regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the density of tobacco retailers and illegal tobacco sales rates on current smoking and lifetime smoking prevalence. Results: Schools had a range between 0 and 9 tobacco retailers within their neighborhood with a mean of 2.76 retailers (SD=2.45). The illegal sales rate varied from 0% to 100%, with a mean of 13%. The density of tobacco retailers was significantly related to the prevalence of ever smoking among students (b=0.09, t(29)=2.03, p=.051, OR=1.10), but not to current smoking (p>.05); the illegal tobacco sales rate was not related to current smoking or lifetime smoking prevalence (p>.05).

However, investigations of perceived stress amongst Spanish-speaking student groups are sparse. This study aimed to (i) describe the translation, adaptation and psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Dental Environment Stressors questionnaire and (ii) to examine the perceived sources of stress and their associations with the students' study year and gender in two dental schools in Latin America. Materials and methods: All students officially registered in the dental schools of the University of San Sebastian (USS) in Chile and the Catholic University of Cordoba (CUC) in Argentina were invited to participate in the study. The DES30 questionnaire was adapted in Spanish using translation/back-translation, an expert bilingual committee, and consensus building. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the instrument's internal consistency, and iterated principal factor analysis with promax rotation was employed to explore its underlying factor structure. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate methods were used to examine the patterns of association between individual stressors, factor scores and students' characteristics. Results: Three hundred and four students comprised the study's analytical sample, with two-thirds of those being female. The DES30-Sp demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.89). A four-factor solution emerged and included 'academic workload', 'clinical training', 'time constraints' and 'self-efficacy beliefs' factors. 'Fear of failing a course or a year', 'examinations and grades' and 'lack of time for relaxation' were amongst the top individual-item stressors reported by students in both schools. Amongst this group of undergraduate dental students, those in Argentina, in higher study year, and females reported higher perceived stress. Conclusions: Increased workload, time constraints and some aspects of clinical training were the top stressors of approximately 300 Chilean and Argentinean dental undergraduates. Some variations between schools, males and females and study years were noted. The Spanish version of the DES30 questionnaire performed well, but future studies should evaluate the instrument's properties in larger and more diverse dental student populations. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Clinical training; Dental school; Dental students; Factor analysis; Gender differences; Instrument translation; Self-efficacy; Spanish; Stress","analysis of variance; Argentina; article; Chile; comparative study; dental education; dental student; factorial analysis; female; human; male; mental stress; psychological aspect; publication; questionnaire; sex difference; statistics; workload; young adult; Analysis of Variance; Argentina; Chile; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Questionnaires; Schools, Dental; Sex Factors; Stress, Psychological; Students, Dental; Translations; Workload; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871697154

To help students adequately acquire and develop their knowledge and skills, a teacher can plan a scenario that increases the probability for learning to occur. Such a scenario defines pedagogically sound structures that prevent off-task behavior and engage students in more meaningful interactions. The main difficulty in designing effective CL scenarios is transforming the teacher's intentions into elements that constitute the learning scenario. This problem is frequently observed when novice teachers attempt to improve the quality of learning and instruction by blending collaborative activities with individual activities without careful planning. With the goal of helping teachers in planning collaborative scenarios, we have developed an intelligent authoring tool referred to as CHOCOLATO using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. ontologies) in order to represent knowledge about different pedagogies and practices related to collaboration. Through the use of this knowledge, CHOCOLATO can provide intelligent guidance that helps teachers to create theory-based CL scenarios which has proven to be effective in a variety of situations. We evaluated it by conducting two experiments. We were interested in verifying whether the recommendations given by CHOCOLATO help novice teachers to design pedagogically sound CL activities, and if these activities help students to learn collaboratively in real classroom settings. The first experiment had the participation of 58 pre-service teachers that created CL scenarios with and without our authoring tool and the second experiment was carried out in a Brazilian public school together with 218 students. The results suggest that the guidance provided by CHOCOLATO do help novice teachers plan, understand and share CL scenarios more easily. They also suggest that the continuous utilization of well-designed theory-based CL activities create favorable conditions for students (particularly less knowledgeable ones) to improve their overall performance throughout the school year. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The way youths speak, in their role as aggressors or as victims, is examined to determine how they experience violence in a number of different spheres. Repeated group interviews are used to analyze how violence is explained and depicted within the family, at school and in the neighbourhood by two groups of young people (14-17 years old) attending the same school on the outskirts of Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazil. One of the groups involved is identified by the school as violent, and the other, as non-violent. Discourse analysis leads to two conclusions. First, the different contexts of violence infuse a mistrust of institutions, the environment and personal relationships into the subjects’ experience, forming a fabric that clouds future prospects. Second, the group of youths identified as violent have a more simplistic, pessimistic view of reality: They see the world in black and white, and they lay no stock in the possibility that violence can be avoided. Consequently, they use violence and understand violence as a defensive strategy that gives one identity. On the other hand, the group identified as nonviolent feels it possible to intervene in situations with nonviolent tools like words. For the young subjects, violence is a context that they assume; it cancels their ability to identify rules and institutions, but it does not generate an effective interaction strategy. Violence causes their social microcontext (in which action prevails over meaning or meaning equals action) to assume overblown dimensions. Any intervention strategy must take into account this indissoluble unity between meaning and action. © 2013, Ministry Education and Science.

Research on language distribution has predominantly developed a reductionist approach that shrinks the whole field of science to publications only in a limited number of indexed international journals. English is shown as hegemonic in most disciplines, and virtually monopolistic in natural sciences. Appropriate language policies for the Francophonie and other super-central language areas should however not be based on such reductionist views, but rather consider language use in the broad sociological (Bourdieu) and communicational (Gumperz) field of science and higher education as a whole which comprises three subfields: production (doing research), circulation (reception and distribution of results), and human capital building (teaching). Analysis shows that communication is solidly grounded in French in the subfields of production and teaching, whereas English and sometimes other languages increasingly intrude in circulation, namely in the reading and writing of international scientific literature.

To overcome this misconcept it is proposed that in the Chemistry courses addressing the properties of metals, the Band Orbitals are named according to the terminology of the Molecular Orbital Theo-r y, such as: «Band-bonding Orbitals», (OBb), for the subgroup of lower energy orbitals, and «Band-antibonding Orbitals» (OB *), for the one with most energy. This research was developed in two stages: the first, instruments design and exploration, from 2007 to 2009, and the second, confirmation of results, in 2010. The results indicate that: a) the students applied the deduction of metal bond strength correctly, b) highly significant statistical association evidence exists between the terminology used and the responses; being highly significant the proportion of correct answers in the group that used the Molecular Orbital Theory terminology.","Band theory; Bonding-antibonding orbital; Electrical conductivity of metals; Metals; Molecular orbital theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906684361

Some instructors believe that active learning is impossible, or at least extremely difficult to achieve in large lecture sessions. Nevertheless, the truly impressive implementation results of the SCALE-UP learning environment suggest that such beliefs are false (Beichner et al., 2000). In this study, we present a design of an active learning environment with positive effect on students. The design is based on the following elements: (1) helping students to learn from interactive lecture experiment; (2) guiding students to use justified explanation and prediction after observing and exploring a phenomenon; (3) developing a conceptual question sequence designed for use in an interactive lecture with students answering questions in worksheets by writing and drawing; (4) evaluating students' conceptual change and gains by questions related to light reflection, refraction, and image formation in an exam held a week after the active learning session. Data were collected from 95 science freshmen with different secondary school backgrounds. They participated in geometrical optics classes organized for collecting research results during and after only one active learning session. The results have showed that around 60% of the students changed their initial alternative conceptions of vision and of image formation.

It is organized around two basic questions: what are we talking about when we refer to mathematics that teachers need to know well for teaching? Which educational practices can contribute to the appropriation of this fundamental mathematics by future teachers for their professional work? To find the answers, different social practices of mathematics educators were problematized seeking clues in those practices regarding the kind of mathematical knowledge required and mobilized in their work. After that, some historical attempts to address the problem of mathematical education of teachers were reviewed, with Felix Klein, Richard Courant and Bento de Jesus Caraça as references, and some Brazilian and international research regarding the training of mathematics teachers. Based on these studies, this article highlights the existence, in the initial training of mathematics teachers, of a quasi trichotomy among academic mathematics, didactic-pedagogic content and teaching practice in schools. To break with this trichotomic tradition some changes are suggested regarding the practice and research on teacher education. For example, teacher training in mathematics must be guided by the different social practices of mathematics educators. These practices can to be adopted in training and projects in which undergraduates can to be integrated, making contrasts, discussions and investigations about the relationships among their undergraduate training in mathematics, their pedagogical-didactic training related to the content, and the complexity of school practices.","Educational Practices; Mathematics Degree; Mathematics for Teaching; Mathematics Teacher Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893666520

When talking about knowledge itself, the way it is perceived, understood, learnt, remembered and thought, we are talking about metacognition. It is considered a crucial aspect in the development of reflective thought, autonomous learning and construction of knowledge. There exists several tools in literature to measure metacognitive aspects, however, there is no instrument related to metacognitive strategies in the area of mathematics. The objective of this study is to design two inventories, one on general metacognitive strategies and the other, for indefinite integrals from the inventory of metacognitive awareness of adults. Method. This study is focused on the translation of metacognitive awareness of adults (MAI) to Spanish and its adaptation to the general metacognitive strategies and indefinite integrals to develop two inventories. Factor analyses were conducted using SPSS to analyze the validity and reliability of them. Results.

First, using a multilevel analytic approach (n. =. 2597), the study shows that, after controlling for socio-demographic variables and the university admission tests, writing skills significantly predict first-year university grades. Second, using information about the performance of students during their first eight semesters in the university (n. =. 1616), a longitudinal hierarchical analysis showed that writing remains a significant predictor of university grades over time, also after controlling socio-demographic variables and university admissions tests. Moreover, language skills retain or improve their predictive role over time, whereas mathematics skills seem to decrease in their importance.

It was found that the elastic constant k is proportional to f-3, while the natural frequency ω0 is proportional to π -3/2, and decreases as π increases. We also show the diferences obtained in the value of the angular frequency ω when the springs are considered as ideal (massless), taking into account the effective mass of the spring, and considering the influence of the damping of the oscillations. This experiment provides students with the possibility of understanding the differences between theoretical models that include well-known corrections to determine the frequency of oscillations of a spring-mass system. ©Sociedade Brasileira de física.","Damping; Elastic constant; Hooke's law; Simple harmonic motion; Spring-mass system",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888329604

Furthermore, the classroom observations do not reveal any innovative teaching strategies, related to the use of this new technology.

As a case study, a model is constructed for teaching integrability of real functions, based on the evolution of the integral concept. With this aim, it is considered a real bounded function, defined on a closed and bounded interval, that is analyzed according to conditions which ensure or exclude its integration by Cauchy, by Riemann, by Lebesgue or by none of these integrals. The idea of modeling integrals using PN was originated in the context of mathematical classes, as the integral was being taught to first year engineering students.","Integral; Modeling; Petri nets; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883583168

This reality is particularly viewed as a possible vector of virtualization, i.e. as an element that enables the transformation of the perception of the problem involving a particular situation or entity. To do so, we make an association between mathematical modeling and transformations that involve the ways of being denoted by real, possible, current and virtual, through the four Aristotelian causes. Complementing this association, we assume a conception of problem that allows a consolidation among the established relationships and also a conception of reality that sees the cyberworld as one of its dimensions. Finally, we present an example of mathematical modeling from the classroom, aiming to characterize the reality of the cyberworld as a vector of virtualization.","Mathematics education; Problem; Reality; Virtual",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881352361

Although many previous works indicate the presence of general characteristics of this perspective, it is not pointed out as the main reference of the text. In this work, some elements that characterize a Mathematical Modeling activity from the socio-critical perspective are proposed, taking as a starting point some major theoretical frameworks already published about this topic. These elements were used to analyze the experiences reported at the VI National Conference on Modeling in Mathematical Education.","Mathematical modeling; Mathematics education; Sociocritical perspective; VI national conference on modeling in mathematical education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881335117

Mathematics-based discursive acts become identified, as crucial elements in an interpretation of mathematics as discourse. The discursive acts are: (1) technological imagination, (2) hypothetical reasoning, (3) legitimation or justification, (4) realisation, and (5) dissolution of responsibility. Through such acts, mathematics exercises symbolic power and makes possible new forms of symbolic violence.","Analytic duality-interpretation of language; Discursive acts; Discursive interpretation of language; Symbolic power; Symbolic violence",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881328173

A framework of mathematical modelling in a critical mathematics education perspective is presented, emphasizing Paulo Freire's problematizing and liberating conception of education, the critical mathematics education by Ole Skovsmose, and these references in organizing mathematical modelling learning milieu. The methodological approach was qualitative and the main procedure was the analysis of the work report developed by the group. From the analysis, it was possible to notice at least two different ways in which the group interpreted what to be critical means: one that suggests a critical insertion of students in their reality, and another that relied on mathematical certainties to reach the conclusions of the project.","Critical mathematics education; Liberating education; Mathematical modelling; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881325594

These discussions took place at two different times before the implementation of the modelling task in the participants' teaching practice: first, during the general discussion of the planning of the modelling environment, and again when each teacher developed their lesson plans. The general discussion took place during the fifth meeting of the course. The qualitative data was collected through observations made during the meeting. The results suggest that the discussions among the participants converge on two aspects of the planning of the modelling environment: the planning of teachers' actions and the planning of the modelling task. In addition, we observed that teachers, during discussions with the teacher educator, tend to legitimize the teacher educator's discourse in the planning, in this case, when dealing with the dilemma of open versus closed problem-situations. They also had difficulty in presenting elements that can generate a social debate or reflections with the students in a pedagogic practice.","Planning of the mathematical modelling environment; Teacher education; Teachers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881321544

In the analysis, we focused on oral and written reports of a group of students from the Biological Science course at the State University of São Paulo (UNESP).

We believe, however, that it can, provide valid information sufficient in accuracy for policy making. Most importantly, we believe, this method offers a feasible way for national researchers to explore why teachers teach as they do in their country. A fundamental assumption is that once in the classroom most teachers learn little more about teaching. In the absence of any systematic feedback or self-reflection on their experiences, they persist in using practices learned in their initial training. On that basis we invited colleagues in a number of countries to share observations on how teachers teach. The compiled results provide an explanation for low levels of learning in many developing country schools.

It considers two forms of 20th-century socialism, the centrally planned economy and social democracy, in the light of Marx's concept of accumulation. 'Accumulation' names both the logic of capitalism and the dynamic that drives it. A focus on the need to deal with the probability that the accumulation dynamic will falter in the process of moving from capitalism to socialism helps to explain socialism's decline. 'Unbounded organisation' is introduced as a broader concept that includes the 'bounded' social organisation that frames capitalism and its accumulation dynamic as a special case. It helps to both explain the decline of socialism and to suggest how to reverse that decline. It is suggested that the socialism of the future can best be defined not as a certain form of social organisation, but rather as the power of the people to choose the set of economic and other institutions that works best for them. Three of Alexander's contributions to building an unbounded socialism are found in his proposals for grass-roots organising at the neighbourhood level, in his promotion of multilingualism, and in his advocacy of alternative education. © 2013 Copyright The University of Johannesburg.","accumulation; Alexander; central planning; Marxism; social democracy; socialism",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879645133

A ten-meeting program was implemented. Tese meetings were held once a week and lasted approximately fifty minutes. Te proposal consisted of direct, explicit, and systematic teaching by means of instruction sequences, based on the counting procedures used by the students, who were evaluated at two diferent times (pretest and post test). We found that there was improvement in the counting procedures used by the children after the intervention, revealing that the program was effective.

We consider a specific case, corresponding to a very simple situation, where a primary system interacts with a bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature, with an interaction Hamiltonian that resembles the Jaynes-Cummings format. We start with the Born-Markov equation and, tracing out the bath degrees of freedom, we obtain an equation in the Lindblad form. The specific situation is very instructive, for it makes it easy to realize that the Lindblads represent the effect on the main system caused by the interaction with the bath, and that the Markov approximation is a fundamental condition for the emergence of the Lindbladian operator. The formal derivation of the Lindblad equation for a more general case requires the use of quantum dynamical semi-groups and broader considerations regarding the environment and temperature than we have considered in the particular case treated here. © The Sociedade Brasileira de Física.","Lindblad equation; Open quantum systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874985808

The diploma's study called Health Promotion Management is a postgraduate course that facilitates in a synchronically and asynchronically way, the acquisition of knowledge and abilities for the professional performance. It was developed at the international level in the virtual public health campus; it was credited by the National School of Public Health and is part of a PAHO project endorsed by the IberoAmerican Consortium of Universities. Objectives: To present the experience gained during the virtual diploma's study called Health Promotion Management. Methods: A descriptive research was carried out to analyze the two editions of the course taught in the period of June 2010 to November 2011. The whole universe of students (43) and 15 tutors/professors from the faculty participated. Qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied. Results: The highest number of participants included physicians, nurses and pedagogues from 13 Iberoamerican countries. Thirty nine students graduated (90.6 %). The rate of students who remained in the course was 82 %. Eighty five percent stated the benefits of the networked learning model and 95 % pointed out the adequate relationship between what they learned and their professional performance. Conclusions: This diploma's study helps managers, professionals, university professors and non-governmental organization officials to develop the methodological competences needed in learning processes to resolve problems of health promotion and education. The monitoring, the systematic meetings with tutors and the teamwork are the key for teaching success.","Distance education; Formation of human resources; Health promotion; Network education; Virtual campus",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874721654

Paradoxically, the health professionals do not publish the results of their research studies on a systematic basis for a number of reasons; hence, the authors took the decision of giving some thoughts about this situation. Three categories of different factors were identified. They are linked to authors, lack of motivation, time-consuming and knowledge, the organizational climate (lack of systematization and of control by the managers) and to editing process management. Different alternative solutions were provided. It was concluded that extracurricular strategies should be promptly implemented in the undergraduate education and strengthened in the postgraduate education, in addition to the support of managers to scientific production and dissemination by means of particular policies.","Health professionals; Publication; Scientific production; Scientific research",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874710783

Postgraduate EE has been measured in hospital settings. However, there are no instruments available to measure the EE in postgraduate ambulatory settings. Aim: The aim of this study was to develop the ""Ambulatory Care Learning Education Environment Measure"" (ACLEEM). Methods: A mixed methodology was used including three stages: (1) Grounded theory (focus groups); (2) Delphi technique to identify consensus; and (3) Pilot study. Results: Three quota samples of approximately 60 stakeholders were formed, one as Focus Groups and two as Delphi panels. Eight focus groups were carried out including 58 residents (Latin-American Spanish speakers). The results were analysed and 173 items were offered to a National Delphi panel (61 residents and teachers). They reduced in two rounds the number of important items to 54. The 54-item questionnaire was then piloted with 63 residents and refined to the final version of the ACLEEM with 50 items and three domains. Conclusions: The 50-item inventory is a valid instrument to measure the EE in postgraduate ambulatory setting in Chile. Large-scale administration of the ACLEEM questionnaire to evaluate its construct validity and reliability are the next steps to test the psychometric properties of the instrument. © 2013 Informa UK.

We demonstrate the value of an approach that compares results obtained using various measures of race. Using a national probability sample of the Brazilian population that captured race in six formats, we first show how the racial composition of Brazil can shift from majority white to majority black depending on the classification scheme. In addition, using quantile regression, we find that racial disparities are most severe at the upper end of the income distribution; that racial disparities in earnings are larger when race is defined by interviewers rather than self-identified; and that those classified as "" black"" suffer a greater wage penalty than those classified as "" brown."" Our findings extend prior conclusions about racial inequality in Brazil. More generally, our analysis demonstrates that comparison of results across measures represents a neglected source of analytic leverage for advancing empirical knowledge and theoretical understanding of how race, as a multidimensional social construct, contributes to the production of social inequality. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Brazil; Classification; Inequality; Quantile regression; Race; Skin tone",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869097523

These foundations are broadly described by the term relational thinking. In this exploratory study of the mathematical thinking of a selection of Year 7 and Year 8 students in Brazil, we found that when students were asked to solve numerical expressions using four arithmetic operations, most students opted for computational methods. However, when required to show relational thinking, most students did so, but clearly needed further support in this respect.","Algebraic thinking; Curriculum reform; Implications for teaching; Justification; Relational thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870281166

In this paper is describe and analyze the conceptions of learning from reading academic texts that keep college students, freshmen to education science, in the situation of reading to writing with peers. The theoretical assumption is supported by research on conceptions about learning, understood as implicit theories (direct, interpretative and con-structive) and scientific approaches to reading (skills, interactive and transactional). Method. The study assumes a non-experimental design, transactional descriptive. Participants are Argentine university students, freshmen to different areas of educational knowledge. For data collection was a questionnaire of dilemmas, built, tested, reviewed and validated for this research. The data analysis was performed by calculating descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis, based on four categories (concept, conditions, processes and results of learning from reading) and three dimensions analysis (reproductive-direct, interpretative-interactive and constructive-transactional). Results. The answers of the students on the concept, is distributed similarly between interpre-tive-interactive and constructive-transactional theories; regarding the conditions, are mostly linked to a reproductive-direct theory; in relation to processes, are distributed similarly be-tween direct-reproductive, interactive-interpretative and constructive-transactional theory; respect of results, mainly linked with one constructive-transactional theory. On the other hand, the configurations that assume these categories forming conceptions, not fully corre-spond to the conceptual structure of implicit theories of learning, described in investigations that constitute our empirical and conceptual framework. Conclusion. The results obtained show that the conceptions studied are inconsistent when compared with the implicit theories of learning. Different shaped configurations are character-ized by: a) being homogeneous but categorically incomplete in theoretical terms or b) being categorically complete but heterogeneous in theoretical terms, compared with the Implicit Theories about learning. © 2012.

The purpose of this study was to determine technical and pedagogical readiness of faculty and students for the feasibility of offering online medical courses. Methods: This case study was conducted on the main campus of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (Ecuador) using both quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry. Data were gathered using online readiness surveys of faculty (10) and students (25), semi-structured interviews with each faculty member, and a focus group interview of eight students. Results: Based on the descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis, faculty and students had positive attitudes toward online courses and overall were prepared in technological readiness. However, the faculty’s knowledge about online teaching pedagogy and instructional design was insufficient. The results also showed several positive aspects of assessing readiness for online education and provided key information for developing solutions to the problems and challenges faculty and students may face in initiating online medical education. Time and budget were reported as the two biggest barriers to develop and implement online courses. Conclusion: Assessing the readiness of faculty and students to participate in online instruction can be challenging, but it is an essential step to get each individual’s input to address common needs and concerns. This process is very helpful in identifying critical success factors, choosing the right approach and applying timely strategies to ensure smooth transitions to new teaching and learning modalities. © 2012, Springer International Publishing.","Faculty Readiness; Online Medical Curriculum; Online Teaching and Learning; Student Readiness",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901021617

Phase two correlates this efficiency with demand for courses at university entrance. If there is a strong positive association, it can be stated that the State with greatest educational efficiency in mathematics has a greater demand for this course. Results show that the most efficient States in relation to Mathematics are also those where students choose careers more closely related to mathematics, especially various types of engineering courses. Another more troubling result suggests that careers involving teacher-training in exact sciences, such as Physics and Mathematics, are in greater demand in States with less efficiency in Mathematics.","Academic achievement; Basic education; Career choice; Mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875391075

The theoretical assumption is supported by research on conceptions about learning, understood as implicit theories (direct, interpretative and constructive) and scientific approaches to reading (skills, interactive and transactional). Method: The study assumes a non-experimental design, transactional descriptive. Participants are Argentine university students, freshmen to different areas of educational knowledge. For data collection was a questionnaire of dilemmas, built, tested, reviewed and validated for this research. The data analysis was performed by calculating descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis, based on four categories (concept, conditions, processes and results of learning from reading) and three dimensions analysis (reproductive-direct, interpretativeinteractive and constructive-transactional). Results: The answers of the students on the concept, is distributed similarly between interpretive-interactive and constructive-transactional theories; regarding the conditions, are mostly linked to a reproductive-direct theory; in relation to processes, are distributed similarly between direct-reproductive, interactive-interpretative and constructive-transactional theory; respect of results, mainly linked with one constructive-transactional theory. On the other hand, the configurations that assume these categories forming conceptions, not fully correspond to the conceptual structure of implicit theories of learning, described in investigations that constitute our empirical and conceptual framework. Conclusion: The results obtained show that the conceptions studied are inconsistent when compared with the implicit theories of learning. Different shaped configurations are characterized by: a) being homogeneous but categorically incomplete in theoretical terms or b) being categorically complete but heterogeneous in theoretical terms, compared with the Implicit Theories about learning. © Education y Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (Spain).","Academic writing; Conceptions of learning; Reading; University students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875272649

In the experiment reported in this article, there is an observation of interference between a light beam coming from the source and another light beam coming from a mirror reflection. Values of measurements of the wave length of light were close to 700 nm, which is in reasonable agreement with standard experimental values.

Organizational culture is more and more considered as an important factor which links all elements of one organization into one clear whole. Occupational safety is one of the important elements of each organization, first of all starting with care for people's health, as well as the costs of injuries at work, which are very high. In this work the elements of the empiric research of organizational culture have been shown with the aim to consider the influences of management attitudes on organizational culture and its influence on occupational safety. The sample consisted of 801 examinees from 69 companies, 11 industries. We used a quantity research method, a questionnaire. For data and information analysis we used the softer program SPSS, as well as appropriate descriptive statistic methods, a factor analysis, a linear regressive analysis. We determined that the effects such as workplace, number of employees in an organization and the level of education on the attitude towards occupational safety are accomplished indirectly through the top management and their way of managing. The work also consists of the comparative analysis and researches on the problem of the Influence of organizational culture on safety and health system at work in business organizations in Slovenia and companies in Serbia. The contribution of this work is both theoretical and practical. Theoretical contribution is based on collecting information and gaining new knowledge referring to the relation between the top management and safety and health at work and managing security. The practical characteristic of this work is that it can be useful for those ones who create policies on safety and health at work in the country (in profession, legislation and with employers) as well as for the top management and their everyday work. The structure of the research enabled us to make a comparison with another similar research, of other cultural environments and in the world. It means that with its assistance we can module additional part of mosaic, which enables us to understand the behavior of the leading managers in the global competition, connected with managing security and health of employees.","A manager and occupational safety; Occupational safety; Organizational culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874441057

In 2009, undergraduate students in the first and final years of medical school at the University of Santa Catarina answered questionnaires regarding their choice of mode of delivery. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the education process affects decision-making regarding the waay of childbirth preferred by medical students. Methods. A cross-sectional, quantitative study was conducted based on data obtained from questionnaires applied to medical students. The questions addressed four different scenarios in childbirth, as follows: under an uneventful pregnancy; the mode of delivery for a pregnant woman under their care; the best choice as a healthcare manager and lastly, choosing the birth of their own child. For each circumstance, there was an open question to explain their choice. Results: A total of 189 students answered the questionnaires. For any uneventful pregnancy and for a pregnant woman under their care, 8.46% of the students would opt for CS. As a healthcare manager, only 2.64% of the students would recommend CS. For these three scenarios, the answers of the students in the first year did not differ from those given by students in the sixth year. In the case of the student's own or a partner's pregnancy, 41.4% of those in the sixth year and 16.8% of those in the first year would choose a CS. A positive association was found between being a sixth year student and a personal preference for CS according to logistic regression (OR = 2.91; 95%CI: 1.03-8.30). Pain associated with vaginal delivery was usually the reason for choosing a CS. Conclusions: A higher number of sixth year students preferred a CS for their own pregnancy (or their partner's) compared to first year students. Pain associated with vaginal delivery was the most common reason given for haven chosen a CS. The students' preference for childbirth changed over time during their graduation in favor of cesarean sections.

The objectives of this study were 1) develop and implement a discipline based on the WHO's Guide to Good Prescribing; 2) evaluate the course acceptance by students; 3) assess the impact that the Rational Use of Medicines (RUM) knowledge had on the students habits of prescribing medication in the University Hospital. Methods. In 2003, the RUM principal, based in the WHO's Guide to Good Prescribing, was included in the official curriculum of the Botucatu School of Medicine, Brazil, to be taught over a total of 24 hours to students in the 4th year. We analyzed the students' feedback forms about content and teaching methodology filled out immediately after the end of the discipline from 2003 to 2010. In 2010, the use of RUM by past students in their medical practice was assessed through a qualitative approach by a questionnaire with closed-ended rank scaling questions distributed at random and a single semistructured interview for content analysis. Results: The discipline teaches future prescribers to use a logical deductive process, based on accurate and objective information, to adopt strict criteria (efficacy, safety, convenience and cost) on selecting drugs and to write a complete prescription. At the end of it, most students considered the discipline very good due to the opportunity to reflect on different actions involved in the prescribing process and liked the teaching methodology. However, former students report that although they are aware of the RUM concepts they cannot regularly use this knowledge in their daily practice because they are not stimulated or even allowed to do so by neither older residents nor senior medical staff. Conclusions: This discipline is useful to teach RUM to medical students who become aware of the importance of this subject, but the assimilation of the RUM principles in the institution seems to be a long-term process which requires the involvement of a greater number of the academic members. © 2012 Patricio et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Drug; Education; Medical; Prescribing; Prescription; Rational Use of Medicines; Undergraduate","prescription drug; article; clinical practice; curriculum; evaluation; human; medical education; medical student; methodology; program development; psychological aspect; qualitative research; questionnaire; teaching; university hospital; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Hospitals, University; Humans; Physician's Practice Patterns; Prescription Drugs; Program Development; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Students, Medical; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872589553

We estimate discrete-choice multinomial models to identify variables (including teacher characteristics, institutional features and geographical factors) associated with the location of teachers in the first jobs of their careers. Results indicate that teacher markets are regional in scope. Being born in a certain province (sub-area of a region) substantially increases the probability of having a first teaching position in that same province. We also find evidence that the geographic mobility of teachers is quite limited.

Observations were made in the classroom and on the school playground. Five different mathematical situations were used to investigate five numerical principles: one to one correspondence, constant order, cardinality, abstraction and irrelevance of order. It was concluded that the principle of one to one correspondence in these children appears later than in their peers, and the principles of abstraction and irrelevance of order are the least developed in these children. There are children with syndromes such as these enrolled in regular classrooms. In order to ensure inclusion that encourages mathematical success, it is important to gain knowledge about their cognitive abilities and how they appropriate concepts and mathematical content.","Difficulties in learning mathematics; Fragile X syndrome; Numerical count; Prader-Willi syndrome; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869204094

This critical, exploratory study blends these two strands of inquiry by examining critically interview data on the implementation of a public elementary school EFL program in a Mexican state. Program staff and parents were interviewed in an attempt to identify instances of power struggle and ideology that would yield an initial description and data for further research. The results illustrate a number of trends in EFL teaching in Mexico that reflect and reproduce neoliberal ideologies. They also reveal the complexity of power dynamics within different government agents and how they affect language policy. It is suggested that a focus on these dynamics, which we call meso-policy, can yield useful data for LPP scholars to engage in actions tending toward the development of community policy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","community policy; critical ethnography; elementary schools; English-as-a-foreign-language; governmentality; ideology and power; Mexican language policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873678576

However, this construction also introduces many conceptual hurdles for students. The idea of representing the propagation of waves by means of a light ray, which is a line or curve perpendicular to the wavefront, is the main cause of conceptual problems. Likewise, the geometrical optic constructions require a deep understanding of trigonometrical relations, which make the study of optical objects a hard subject. Nowadays, these conceptual problems can be overcome using applets in the presentation of lesson content. Therefore, we propose to create and include new curricular material using GeoGebra software.

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices. © 2011 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a descriptive study using a focus group of practicing pharmacists who participated in continuing education using the internet for the first time. Findings: The participants' descriptions and impressions with regard to online continuing education (CE) experiences were both emphatic and covered all aspects of the process, from accessing the CE site to selecting a topic to reading the content and answering the questions. Pharmacists recognized the importance and advantages of online CE, but demonstrated preference for live CE. Lack of technical skills is still a limitation, especially the lack of internet navigation skills. Research limitations/implications: The recruiting methodology did not result in a sufficient number of participants for the two sessions that were planned which highlighted some of the cultural aspects of the process of inviting professionals to attend and participate in a focus group. Even though only one focus group was conducted, the systematic approach garnered detailed and valuable information. Practical implications: Strong preferences for live CE, the need for socializing, and time-management issues were identified as being barriers to participating in CE that educators, professional associations and CE providers can address. Continuing education designers and providers must carefully design their web pages and courses to increase its quality, to facilitate taking a CE, to increase satisfaction, and to increase recurrent use. Originality/value: The paper presents the reactions of a group of adult professionals as they encounter a new learning experience by means of the internet. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adult learners; Attitudes; Continuing education; Internet; Pharmacy; Professional development; Puerto Rico; Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866845261

From this perspective, the use of emic and etic approaches facilitates the translation of problem situations present in the systems, extracted from the reality of distinct cultural groups, into academic mathematics. Emic knowledge is essential to the intuitive and empathic understanding of the mathematical practices developed by a particular cultural group, while etic knowledge is essential for comparing these practices. We also discuss the dialectical approach to research on ethnomodeling, which uses both emic and etic knowledge through a dialogic process, aiding a fuller understanding of the knowledge of the mathematical practices developed by members of different cultural groups. In this sense, emic knowledge is a valuable source of inspiration for the development of etic hypotheses. In such a dialectical context, a mathematics curriculum based on the ethnomodeling perspective favors the generation of mathematical knowledge to ensure the balanced integration of the effective mastery of educational objectives, which are essential for the recognition and use of students' emic knowledge.","Dialectical approach; Emic approach; Ethnomodeling; Ethnomodels; Etic approach",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874984953

We considered that uncovering their life history would enable us to understand some of the reasons why the number of women identified as gifted is lower than men, why they fail to recognize themselves as gifted or why they hide their giftedness indicators and have trouble building their specific identity as gifted persons. This is a qualitative longitudinal case study. The research instruments were the QIIAHSD-Adult (Questionnaire to Identify Giftedness Indicators-Adults) applied on three separate occasions - 2008, 2009 and 2011 - and a semi-structured interview. We realized that, over the years, both participants have showed progressive acceptance of giftedness indicators after formal identification, as well as of their identity as gifted persons. Their answers revealed that they were building a positive identity as gifted women; the evidence for this is that many indicators not perceived in 2008 emerged in their discourse and attitudes in 2011. Part of this process is based upon contact and exchanges with gifted peers and increased discussion of the theme. Nevertheless, it is also clear that identification was a decisive factor in these women's acceptance and recognition of themselves as gifted. This evidence leads us to defend that, in addition to specialized educational services for gifted students, which are already assured by law, we should also think about specific strategies to nurture giftedness in women.","Giftedness; Identity; Special education; Women",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872335191

This battery was developed to briefly examine orientation, attention, perception, memory, arithmetic abilities, language, praxis, and executive functions, in the context of Brazilian culture. Education was measured by years of study in teaching institutions, and the frequency of RWH was measured by a scale for specific reading and writing items.

One-way analysis of variance indicated significant differences between groups in the attention, memory, arithmetic abilities, language, constructional praxis, problem solving and verbal fluency tasks of NEUPSILIN. Results pointed to the relevance of the frequency of RWH to performance in attention, working memory, executive functions, and language tasks.

Structured methods encompass a range of pedagogical and managerial instruments applied in the educational system. In recent years, several municipalities in the state of São Paulo have contracted out private educational providers to implement these structured methods in their schooling systems. Their pedagogical proposal involves structuring of curriculum content, development of teacher and student textbooks, and the training and supervision of teachers and instructors. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the 4th- and 8th-grade students in the municipalities with structured methods performed better in Portuguese and mathematics than did students in municipalities not exposed to these methods. We find no differences in passing rates. A robustness test supports the assumption that there is no unobserved municipal characteristics associated with proficiency changes over time that may affect the results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Brazil; Quality of education; Structured methods","educational attainment; primary education; student; teacher training; teaching; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864350249

Thus, we aimed to analyze the meanings of values involved in the realization of these school games, focusing in the opening ceremonies. Moreover, we intended to understand the reasons that guide teachers to organize such competitions. For doing so, two schools ceremonies were observed and interviews were made with teachers who organized the competitions.

However, research on students' perceptions of their experiences in these settings has been limited. The objectives of this study were to assess a group of Brazilian dental students' views of their experiences in a service-learning program focusing on pediatric dental care and to explore changes in their perceptions over the course of the program. Data were collected from fifty-five fourth-year dental students, who submitted a total of 185 reports at four points in time. The students spent sixteen of the 128 hours of their pediatric dentistry course in community-based education developing activities linked to pediatric dental care. Two professors rated each report as a positive or negative experience (Kappa 0.7) and recorded whether the students' reports reflected one or more of five types of response. The response types concerned dental treatment practice, multidisciplinary activities, observation of infant/toddler consultations, commitment of the outreach health team, and change of plans due to technical problems. The data showed that the students had a positive first impression after a short stay in a community-service program, but there was a decrease in the students' positive experiences over time (p<0.001).

An Interactive Platform for Learning Calculus (PIAC) that serves as a container for the LU was created following a specific instructional design, namely, the Teaching Unit Model (TUM), which in turn, rules the platform's design, development and implementation. A general perspective on the development of the platform and its LU is presented, including the results of usability and functionality evaluations, which indicate that the platform and the LU comply with different functionality and usability criteria which are fundamental for their introduction into formal university courses. The platform was utilized in a higher education Calculus course.; its effects on different aspects of the learning process were studied. Two experimental groups and two control groups for a total of 102 students taking the Calculus course participated in the study. Results indicated an overall acceptance of using PIAC in class. Important evidence was obtained on the positive effects of using PIAC, not only influencing academic performance of students, but also in motivational aspects of the learning process. The grades obtained in all of academic activities by the groups using PIAC, compared with the control groups, provide solid evidence to the positive influence of the intervention of the technology under the TUM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Evolution at the molecular level, however, is chiefly ruled by random genetic drift. The idea that an advantageous allele may be lost by chance in a natural population is rather difficult to explore in the classroom. Low-cost and hands-on educational resources are needed to make genetic drift more intuitive among students. In this exercise, we use colored beads and the roll of a die to simulate drift and selection jointly affecting the fate of the genetic variants in an evolving population. Our aim is to teach students that natural selection does not determine but simply influences the fate of advantageous alleles because random genetic drift is always present.

The Ministry of Education allocated three-year non-competitive funds to public universities so that undergraduate courses that had been accredited for three years could meet their commitment to fulfill improvement plans. To study this public policy we used the case study method, selecting the most important project in terms of the amount of resources allocated and the number of courses covered: the Project for the Improvement of Teaching Engineering Programs (PROMEI). We analyzed documents and quantitative evidence, in addition to conducting in-depth interviews with key informants and semi-structured interviews with the authorities of academic units. The findings show that the majority of the total degree courses financed by PROMEI were accredited for another three-year period. Moreover, the respondents positively evaluated the impacts of this project to overcome the weaknesses of the engineering programs detected during the accreditation procedure. The positive evaluation of this public policy is related to two factors: first, diverse actors from the engineering community participated in the formulation of the policy; second, the funding items took into account the multiple factors that intervene in order to improve the teaching activity. Finally, it had an additional unexpected effect by contributing to legitimize the quality accreditation procedures.","Higher education policy; Quality accreditation; University change; University funding",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish; Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864818369

The Jefferson Scale of Empathy is the most commonly used measure of empathy worldwide, and to date it has been translated in 39 languages. This study aimed to adapt the Jefferson Scale of Empathy to the Brazilian culture and to test its reliability and validity among Brazilian medical students. Methods. The Portuguese version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy was adapted to Brazil using back-translation techniques. This version was pretested among 39 fifth-year medical students in September 2010. During the final fifth- and sixth-year Objective Structured Clinical Examination (October 2011), 319 students were invited to respond to the scale anonymously. Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis, item-total correlation, and gender comparisons were performed to check the reliability and validity of the scale. Results: The student response rate was 93.7% (299 students). Cronbach's coefficient for the scale was 0.84. A principal component analysis confirmed the construct validity of the scale for three main factors: Compassionate Care (first factor), Ability to Stand in the Patient's Shoes (second factor), and Perspective Taking (third factor). Gender comparisons did not reveal differences in the scores between female and male students. Conclusions: The adapted Brazilian version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy proved to be a valid, reliable instrument for use in national and cross-cultural studies in medical education. © 2012 Paro et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Empathy; Psychometrics; Students, Medical","article; Brazil; clinical competence; clinical education; comparative study; cultural factor; developing country; doctor patient relation; education; empathy; factorial analysis; female; human; internal medicine; language; male; medical education; medical student; psychological aspect; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; sex difference; statistics; teaching hospital; validation study; Brazil; Clinical Clerkship; Clinical Competence; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cultural Characteristics; Developing Countries; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Empathy; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Internal Medicine; Male; Physician-Patient Relations; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Factors; Students, Medical; Translating",,"This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the Brazilian version of the JSE.

I argue that Brazilian research on technology in mathematics education can be divided into four phases, and then present an example that ‘‘blends’’ aspects of the second and third phases. Phase two can be characterized by research with software designed to address traditional mathematics topics, such as functions, while the third phase is characterized by online courses. The data presented show creative solutions for a problem designed for collectives of humans-with-function-software. The paper is analyzed from a perspective that emphasizes the role of different technologies as teachers and professors collaborate to produce knowledge about the use of mathematical software in regular face-to-face classrooms. A model of online education is presented. Finally, the paper discusses how technology may change collaboration and teaching approaches in continuing education, as it allows for greater integration of online learning with teachers’ classroom activities in schools.

We use the theoretical perspective of the documentational approach that focuses, in this case, on the interaction between teacher educators and the resources they use for their online training work. We thus study the following issues: (1) What kinds of resources do online teacher educators need, and how are such resources modified according to the educators’ specific skills and needs? (2) What specific skills are needed for setting up online training for mathematics teachers and how do these skills evolve as teacher education resources are used? We consider both questions simultaneously, while presenting results from a study within a specific teacher training programme in France that proposes ‘‘training paths’’ on a national platform. These ‘‘paths’’ are resources designed for teacher educators. We follow the appropriation of two training paths by two educator teams. The ways in which these educator teams were able to appropriate the paths give insights into the teacher educators’ skills and, as well, into the resources they need. By looking at their use of resources (as online mathematics teacher educators), we observe and analyse professional geneses, leading to the development of new skills. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2012.","Documentational approach; Dynamic geometry; Individualisation; Investigation; Mathematics teacher education; Online resources; Online teacher education; Teacher educators’ professional knowledge; Training path",,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 234870",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902658090

Since these studies focused on Prussia, the open question is not only how the other states eventually adapted to the neo-humanist system, but also how far the Prussian system had to adapt to more classical orientations.

The data that were collected included their performances, interviews pertaining to their practice and stimulated recall interviews. These data were analyzed in terms of the ways of knowing and types of knowledge that are articulated in Davidson and Scripp's (1992) matrix of cognition skills in music. The data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The production of representation (outside the actual performance) showed a structural relationship with the local and global information about the piece. In terms of perception, cognitive skills were essentially dependent on expertise levels. Concerning the ways of knowing as reflection, a number of students were able to identify problems outside of their own performance. However, the solutions to these problems were less often planned. In summary, graduate students tended to rely on procedural knowledge, while the undergraduates generally used declarative knowledge. The results suggest that graduate students are more likely to make tacit decisions rather than verbal decisions. © The Author(s) 2012.","cognition; musical knowledge; musical thinking; performance; piano practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866032046

To illuminate this issue, we compare teacher performance on a mathematics assessment, during mathematics instruction, and by student performance on a state assessment. Poor performance on the written assessment predicted poor classroom performance; likewise, strong performance on the written assessment predicted strong classroom performance. However, classroom performance of teachers in the middle of the written assessment distribution varied considerably.

The aim of this paper is to show how SDG can be used to improve the way resources are used in schools, allowing students to work simultaneously on individual problems at a shared display, and achieve personalized learning with individual feedback within different cultural contexts. We used computational fluency to apply our concept of 'One Mouse per Child'. It consists of a participatory approach that makes use of personal feedback on an interpersonal computer for the whole classroom. This allows for N simultaneous intelligent tutoring systems, where each child advances at his or her own pace, both within a lecture and throughout the curricular units. Each student must solve a series of mathematical exercises, generated according to his or her performance through a set of pedagogical rules incorporated into the system. In this process, the teacher has an active mediating role, intervening when students require attention. Two exploratory studies were performed. The first study was a multicultural experience between two such distanced socio-economic realities as Chile and India. It showed us that even in different environmental conditions, it is possible to implement this technology with minimal equipment (i.e. a computer, a projector, and one mouse per child). The second study was carried out in a third grade class in a low-income school in Santiago de Chile. The students were asked to solve mainly addition exercises. We established statistically relevant results and observed that the software proved most beneficial for the students with the lowest initial results. This happens because the system adapts to the students' needs, reinforcing the content they most need to work on, thus generating a personalized learning process. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arithmetic teaching; Interpersonal computer; Multiple mouse; One Mouse per Child; Shared display",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862850056

The analysis has shown that, although an increase can be noticed in the number of works implemented in the school environment, gaps still exist in relation to studies investigating this characteristic in minority samples (disabled students, students with high skills, the elderly in universities for senior citizens, non formal learning spaces).","Psychology; School education; Scientific production; State-of-the-art",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869417114

The aim of this article is to contribute in this direction, investigating how visual representations can structure geometry activity in the classroom and discussing teaching practices that can facilitate students' visualization of mathematical objects. We present one illustrative episode that shows how drawings of geometrical figures have a powerful role in structuring and modifying the mathematical activity in the classroom. It was selected from a database that we have been building to investigate the learning of mathematics in public elementary schools in Brazil. The framework of Activity Theory helped in the characterization of the episode as a system of interconnected activities. We discuss the changes and transformations perceived in those activities; and we explore the idea of miniature cycles of learning actions to focus on the mathematical learning that is taking place. We describe the dynamics and the complexity of the ongoing activity in the calculation of areas; and, how drawings form a part, and show their influence, in it. We argue that part of this influence was associated with the contradiction between abstract mathematical ideas and their empirical representations, revealed by the tensions perceived in the activities analysed; and, simultaneously, that we could see as an impelling force for the learning of the rules and norms which regulate the use of visual representations in school mathematics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Activity Theory; Drawings; Geometry; Visual representations; Visualization in mathematics education",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG","Acknowledgments The authors want to declare, first of all, their gratitude to the teacher and students involved in this study, for all we have learned with them.

The other two generations articulate the results of the assessments to accountability policies, with the attribution of symbolic or material consequences for the school agents. Taking as a parameter of analysis the objectives and designs of these assessments, as well as studies and researches that produced results about this theme, possible implications for the school curriculum are explored. On the one hand, a discussion is made of the risks that standardized tests, with evaluations that make reference to accountability policies involving weak and strong consequences, may exacerbate the concern of teachers and principals with the preparation for the tests and for the activities they include, leading to a narrowing of the school curriculum. On the other hand, the text points out the potential of the second and third generation assessments to stimulate an informed discussion of school curriculum in terms of the fundamental abilities of reading and mathematics which have not yet been guaranteed to all pupils.","Accountability; Assessment of education; School curriculum",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869770706

Mexico and the Philippines both have voluntary systems of medical education accreditation and large numbers of students who voluntarily take components of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). We investigated the examination performance of Mexican and Philippine citizens who attended medical schools in their home countries by medical school accreditation status. Methods The sample included 5045 individuals (1238 from Mexico, 3807 from the Philippines) who took at least one of the three USMLE components required for Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) certification. We also separately studied 2702 individuals who took all three examinations (589 from Mexico, 2113 from the Philippines). The chi-squared statistic was used to determine whether the associations between outcomes (first attempt pass rate on USMLE components and rate of ECFMG certification) and medical school accreditation (yes/no) were statistically significant. Results For the sample of registrants who took at least one USMLE component, first attempt pass rates on all USMLE components were higher for individuals attending accredited schools, although there were differences in pass rates among the components and between the two countries. The distinction was greatest for USMLE Step 1, for which attending an accredited school was associated with increases in first attempt pass rates of 15.9% for Mexican citizens and 29.2% for Philippine citizens. In registrants from the Philippines who took all three examinations, attending an accredited medical school was also associated with increased success in obtaining ECFMG certification. Conclusions These findings support the value and usefulness of accreditation in Mexico and the Philippines by linking accreditation to improved student outcomes. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2012.",,"accreditation; article; certification; education; female; foreign worker; human; male; medical education; medical student; methodology; Mexico; Philippines; psychological aspect; standard; statistics; United States; Accreditation; Certification; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; Foreign Medical Graduates; Humans; Male; Mexico; Philippines; Students, Medical; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861465325

Our intention is to discuss the ideological function of these biological concepts as tools for the naturalization and scientific legitimation of racial hierarchies during that period. We argue that the examination of these scientific discussions about race from a historical perspective can play the role of a critical platform for students and teachers to think about the role of science in current othering processes, such as those related to biomedical technosciences. If they learn how biological ideas played an ideological function concerning interracial relationships in the past, they can be compelled to ask which ideological functions the biological knowledge they are teaching and learning might play now. If this is properly balanced, they can eventually both value scientific knowledge for its contributions and have a critical appraisal of some of its implications.

The paper analyzes language games of those different forms of life and the school mathematics discipline, highlighting the complex network of learning and powers that makes other mathematics than that known as the mathematics be positioned ""in a void"" in school curricula. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethnomathematics; Mathematics education; Michel Foucault's work; Wittgenstein's later work",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859269847

Two distinctions are crucial for establishing mechanical and formal perspectives: one between appearance and reality, and one between sense and reference. These distinctions include a nomination of what to consider primary and secondary. They establish the grammatical format of a mechanical and a formal world view. Such views become imposed on the domains addressed by means of mathematics and formal languages. Through such impositions symbolic power of mathematics becomes exercised. The idea that mathematics describes as it prioritises is discussed with reference to robotting and surveillance. In general, the symbolic power of mathematics and formal languages is summarised through the observations: that mathematics treats parts and properties as autonomous, that it dismembers what it addresses and destroys the organic unity around things, and that it simplifies things and reduces them to a single feature. But, whatever forms the symbolic power may take, it cannot be evaluated along a single good-bad axis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Appearance and reality; Critical mathematics education; Robotting; Sense and reference; Surveillance; Symbolic power; Symbolic violence",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859269580

The quality of child care environment and of teacher-child interactions appear to influence children's development, but little attention has been paid to the influence of child-care peers. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort, the authors identify patterns of peer group racial-ethnic composition in center-based child care. Bivariate statistics show the relationships among child care quality and racial-ethnic peer-group composition, and a series of regression models assesses the unique contribution of peer-group composition to children's literacy, receptive and expressive language, math skills, and eagerness to learn. The authors find that center-based child care is highly segregated, with children attending care with predominantly same-race-ethnicity peers. This segregation is associated with differences in quality. Hispanic-and white-dominated peer groups have similarly high quality across domains, whereas black-dominated groups have somewhat lower structural quality and caregiver warmth. Other race-ethnicity-dominated groups have the lowest levels of caregiver warmth. Peer segregation is also associated with differences in child development. Children attending Hispanic-dominated care are found to demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on four out of five outcomes. Possible reasons are explored, and implications for social work research, practice, and policy are discussed. © 2012 National Association of Social Workers.","child care; peer context; segregation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866673837

The resulting dissatisfaction with quantitative physical textbook problems seems to influence the attitude towards the role of mathematics in physics education in general. Mathematics is often seen as a tool for calculation which hinders a conceptual understanding of physical principles. However, the role of mathematics cannot be reduced to this technical aspect. Hence, instead of putting mathematics away we delve into the nature of physical science to reveal the strong conceptual relationship between mathematics and physics. Moreover, we suggest that, for both prospective teaching and further research, a focus on deeply exploring such interdependency can significantly improve the understanding of physics. To provide a suitable basis, we develop a new model which can be used for analysing different levels of mathematical reasoning within physics. It is also a guideline for shifting the attention from technical to structural mathematical skills while teaching physics. We demonstrate its applicability for analysing physical-mathematical reasoning processes with an example. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; European Social Fund, ESF; Freistaat Sachsen","Acknowledgments We would like to thank Ulrike Böhm for fruitful discussions, Edward Redish for his valuable remarks, as well as Brian Danielak and Eric Kuo for their help concerning language issues.

The aims of this study were to identify natural segmentation of freshman undergraduate dental students based on demographic, socioeconomic and educational variables, and to subsequently investigate their impact on academic performance of Brazilian undergraduate students. Cluster analysis (two-step algorithm) was used to segment students who entered dental school in the time period from 1999 to 2001 (n=158) into groups based on responses to a questionnaire completed by students at the time of the admission examination. Clustering analysis revealed three natural groups. Age, the parents' level of education, and performance on the first admission test were the most important variables for cluster segmentation. Cluster 1 (n=42; 26.6%) was characterized by female students with higher socioeconomic status and better previous educational indicators. Cluster 2 (n=62; 39.2%) represented disadvantaged socioeconomic profiles, with a predominance of females and older students. Cluster 3 (n=54; 34.2%) showed similar socioeconomic characteristics to cluster 1, except for male prevalence, higher age, and experiencing difficulty in the admission test. Clusters' academic performance was satisfactory in both overall course and course groups (grade point average of at least 7.0), with average ranging from 7.89 (SD=0.44) to 8.13 (SD=0.31) and 7.37 (SD=0.75) to 8.31(SD=0.26), respectively.

Questions that helped us structure the research included: How do students interpret and deal with the concept of solution to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)? To which extent do students use mathematical concepts they have previously studied to answer basic questions related to ODEs? And, to what extent do the students’ answers privilege the use of certain type of representation to explore and examine issues related to ODEs? Results indicate that, in general, students choose one of two methods to verify whether a function represents a solution to a given ODE: a substitution method or by solving directly the given equation. It was observed that they do not rely on concepts associated with the meaning of derivative to make sense and deal with situations that involve basic ODEs’ ideas; rather, they tend to reduce their knowledge of ODEs to the search for an algorithm (analytical approach) to solve particular groups of equations. In addition, there is evidence that students do not use graphic representations to explore meanings and mathematical relations and they experience difficulties to move back and forth from one type of representation to another. © 2012, Drustvo Matematicara Srbije.

The significant results of science and technology in some countries in recent decades can be explained by taking into account the constant attention of the national authorities in these issues. The students in those schools that do better on tests, are more likely to finish high school, and are more likely to seek higher education. These examples are important for all other countries that plan to improve their level of development, especially in Latin American region. In this text we will perform our analysis based on international test scores in mathematics and science subjects for secondary school students PISA and TIMSS. It is known that chemistry among other natural science represents the most difficult subject for students of secondary and higher schools because of the large number of abstract concepts and theories in its curriculum. For this reason there is an important interest of researchers of science education to different aspects of chemical methodology. It is known too that some countries seem to provide more effective education than others.

Research in chemistry education has recognized the importance of writing textbooks within a history and philosophy of science perspective. The objectives of this study are to compare the presentations of: a) Nature of science (NOS) in general chemistry textbooks published in U.S.A. and Venezuela; and b) Atomic structure in textbooks published in Korea, Turkey, U.S.A., and Venezuela. Among other aspects, nature of science deals with: 1) Tentative nature of scientific theories; 2) Theories do not become laws even with additional evidence; 3) There is no universal step-by-step scientific method; 4) Observations are theory laden; 5) Scientific knowledge relies heavily but not entirely on observation, experimental evidence, rational arguments, creativity and skepticism; and 6) Scientific progress is characterized by competition between rival theories. A historical reconstruction of atomic structure shows that the following aspects are important: 1) Cathode rays as charged particles or waves in the ether (Thomson); 2) Determination of mass-to-charge ratio to decide whether cathode rays were ions or a universal charged particle (Thomson); 3) Nuclear atom (Rutherford); 4) Probability of large angle deflections is exceedingly small as the atom is the seat of an intense electric field (Rutherford); 5) Single/compound scattering of alpha particles (Rutherford); 6) Paradoxical stability of the Rutherford model of the atom (Bohr); 7) Evaluation of the hydrogen line spectrum (Bohr); 8) Deep philosophical chasm (Bohr). Results obtained from different publications show that on both topics (NOS and Atomic structure) most textbooks ignore various aspects of history and philosophy of science and their presentations published in different countries have very little differences. It is concluded that in spite of the cultural differences (U.S.A., Venezuela, Turkey & Korea) textbooks present a very similar empiricist epistemology.","History and philosophy of science; Nature of science; Textbooks",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878044694

To account for the above, this research attempts to determine differences in the syntactic complexity of oral discourses produced by boys and girls with ADDH and with typical development at different level of schooling (kindergarten, fourth and eighth grades). A correlational study was carried out with an ex post-facto retrospective design in which 120 children (60 ADDH; 60 control group) studying at private schools and subsidized schools in San Felipe, Chile, participated. After watching a video, each child narrated what it had watched, and its discourse was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Syntactic complexity indices revealed significant differences favoring non-ADDH children when the group was assessed in general despite no statistical significance was proved in the differences within each school level. Also, it was observed that the gap between the scores among ADDH and non-ADDH children within each group increased in the 8th graders in relation to the 4th graders and in the latter in relation to those in kindergarten, that indicate an improvement in the level of syntactic maturity.","ADDH; Late language; Literacy; Syntactic complexity",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877108820

Currently, technology supports the Active Learning model through the Classroom Response Systems, electronic systems that enable the teacher to propose activities to the students and receive back their resolutions, allowing classroom collaboration, discussion and feedback. In order to support a more dynamic, natural and non-invasive use of technology, this work proposes the use of classroom related context information to support a Ubiquitous Classroom Response System (UCRS). In UCRS, teacher and student's context information are gathered and used to set and update mathematical variables and data records, like the affinity factor among students (which defines how productive the collaboration among two students is), the activity difficulty degree (which defines how difficult is for each student solve an activity), and the activity educational factor (which defines how educationally relevant an activity is). These factors allow UCRS to provide smart and dynamic features like the autonomous activity proposal for teachers (which suggests to the teacher the best activity to be offered to students at some time in the class), the automatic student's group formation (which considers the similarity among activities' resolutions and students' affinity factors), and a dynamic help request process among students. © Common Ground, Ricardo Caceffo, Heloisa Vieira da Rocha, All Rights Reserved.","Active learning; Classroom response system; Learning; Ubiquitous computing; Ubiquitous learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875994332

Methods: a retrospective correlational study was carried out in 121 medical graduates. The academic performance was operatively defined as the average mark achieved by each of the students at the end of the 8th semester. At the entrance examination, six areas are assessed, namely Biology, general culture, Spanish, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry, which were all regarded as predictive variables. The simple linear regression analysis used the average mark achieved at the entrance examination as independent variable and the average mark at the end of the 8th semester as the dependent variable; the multivariate analysis was based on the multiple linear regression. Results: the highest average mark and the highest mark at the entrance examination were found in Mathematics, whereas the lowest results were seen in Physics. The correlation between the general average from the entrance test and the academic performance at the end of the 8th semester amounted to 0.409 (p < 0.01), so the determination coefficient was 0.167. Conclusions: the entrance exam should be basically focused on Biology, Spanish, Mathematics and Chemistry, since these are the areas of knowledge where the correlation reached statistically significant results.","Academic performance; Correlation; Entrance exam; Medical students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871418595

Within more traditional and conservative high-tech sectors such as aerospace, however, the literature on open innovation is fairly limited, even more so in the context of emerging economies. This exploratory paper aims to fill this gap by providing some perspectives from a study whose goal is to identify the implications of the innovation openness paradigm to the product development process in the Brazilian aerospace industry. Using information gathered from Brazilian and Canadian aerospace firms, this paper draws an analogy and raises the hypothesis that companies from emerging economies are more prone to open innovation, since they are often heavily dependent on foreign knowledge and expertise. The findings imply that Brazilian firms should bear in mind that innovation openness is an important aspect to consider when designing an innovation strategy.

Objective: to evaluate the quality of the academic results of medical students in the municipal university affiliate in Los Palacios in the 2008-2009 academic year, after an intervention on individual differences. Methods: research-action; the universe of study and the sample was made up of 30 medical students and the study variables were way of entrance in the university, vocational orientation, educational level of parents, children and/or relatives. Summary measures for qualitative data and odd ratios were used. Results: the way of entrance in the university known as Integrated Upgrading Course for Young People increased the risk of failing a test or the risk of not being evaluated by 16 times; having parents who did not attain university degree rose that risk by 6 times; and the lack of adequate vocation increased it by 29 times. After the intervention, the number of students failing a test or not being evaluated was reduced to zero; however, the Integrated Upgrading Course for Young People continued being the way of entering the university that increased by 8 times the evaluation of students as Regular.

The study reveals that in Chile, more qualified novice teachers are more prone to get jobs in socio-economically advantaged schools or in schools with better academic outcomes. In contrast, in disadvantaged schools, it is more likely to find novice teachers with poor results on their exit exams and who come from socioeconomic backgrounds similar to those of the school populations. These findings provide new data to inform Chilean policies. Hence, achieving a more equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers is a challenge for Chile if the aim is to reduce the achievement gap between schools attended by pupils of higher and lower socioeconomic status. Furthermore, these findings might shed some light on the current debate surrounding teacher education policies. A new law will mandate that novice teachers pass the exit exam that until now they have taken voluntarily in order to be hired in any publicly funded school. This study provides support and evidence to inform the debate that will follow in parliament, since we found that novice teachers performing at a very low level-perhaps below the minimum that will be required-have a high probability of ending up working in schools in more disadvantaged areas. On a more general scale, this research also provides a simple but complete methodology that can be used to study issues of teacher distribution elsewhere.","Chile; Initial teacher training; Primary schools; Segmentation; Stratification; Teacher market; Teacher placement; Teacher policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867115883

The objective was also to determine whether there are differential profiles in the use and consumption of media related to the future role of these profiles in the audiovisual literacy of the students. To do this, a non-random sample was used comprising 881 Pedagogy students of both genders studying at seven universities in southern and central Chile. The «media consumption questionnaire» was used for data collection. In general, the distribution of preferences by gender and degree course falls short of representing idiosyncrasy in terms of the media, and reflects outside realities that do not permit participation in citizenry processes to be strengthened in media consumers. In short, the biggest problem is that future teachers do not seem to have the tools that allow them to manage the work of audiovisual literacy since they themselves have difficulties in differentiating between information and persuasion in advertising messages.","Advertising; Audio-visual literacy; Consumption of media; Critique; Pattern; Pedagogy; Students; University",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865391272

The research aims at investigating, in a critical perspective, the main aspects related to the conception and management of this program; the conceptions underpinning its contents and verify to what extent and in which perspective this program has contributed to meeting the requirements that led to its formulation. The theoretical framework of the research is the policy cycle approach (Bowe et al, 1992; Ball, 1994) and also contributions from authors who discuss the literacy process as well as the role of the school and the school knowledge in a critical perspective (Soares, 1998, 2002). It argues that the Program investigated is a necessary initiative, but not enough to construct an effective improvement in the quality of education offered to the working class families, which requires the implementation of other policies that exceed the in-service teacher training strategies.","Education policy; In-service teacher training; Pro-alphabetization program",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864259500

We also think that the results of international evaluations conducted in different countries are a good strategy to identify the different emphases of the various curriculums. Based on the results of the Program of International Student Assessment - PISA2003, a comparison was made between differences in math curriculum emphases in Brazil and Portugal. The methodology used for analysis was Differential Item Functioning (DIF). This methodology enables the identification of items that violate one of the key assumptions of Item Response Theory (IRT), whereby students from different groups, but the same cognitive skill, have the same probability of answering an item correctly. Analysis of 84 items of the mathematics test of the PISA 2003 showed that some items present DIF between Brazilian and Portuguese students. Some items are easier for Brazilian students, in particular as regards the sub-area ""quantity"". On the other hand, the items of the sub-area ""change and relationships"" are apparently easier for students from Portugal. Items involving scientific contexts are easier for students in Portugal, as well, while involving contexts of personal life are easier for Brazilians. The results of this survey demonstrate the relevance and need of expanded debate on curriculum in education mathematics. Understanding the results of the tests of large-scale evaluations can provide new questions about how and what students learn about Mathematics.","Curriculum Learned; Differential Item Functioning; Education Mathematics; PISA2003",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863843119

This can influence their attitude towards schooling and learning, including the learning of mathematics. We interviewed a group of six students from a favela in a large city in the interior of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. We invited the students to look into their future and explore whether or not there could be learning motives that linked mathematics in school to possible out-of-school practices, either in terms of possible future jobs or further studies. We identified some themes in the students' descriptions of their experiences. The first theme is discrimination. The students feel discriminated against due to the fact that they come from a poor neighbourhood. They fear being trapped in some stereotypes. The second theme is escape. There is a strong motivation to begin a new life away from the favela. A third theme concerns the obscurity of mathematics. It seems clear to everybody that education is relevant to ensure a change in life. However, the mathematics lessons do not provide any clues regarding how mathematics might function is this respect. The fourth theme is uncertainty with respect to the future. The students could easily formulate almost unattainable aspirations, while reality might impose some very heavy limitations. In this article we introduce a theoretical framework for discussing the relation between favela students' life conditions in relation to their educational experiences and opportunities. Students' intentions for learning are related to their foregrounds, that is, how they perceive their future possibilities, as made evident to them by their social environment. Students in a favela could experience what we call a borderland position, a relational space where individuals meet their social environment and come to terms with the multiple choices that cultural and economic diversity make available to them.","Borderland Position; Discrimination; Intentionality; Obscurity of Mathematics; Students' Foreground; Uncertainty with Respect to the Future",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863828905

A qualitative research methodology was used, with interpretative analysis of the activities and the proposed instruments, which were organized in a Portfolio Book. The formulation and the application of the research, as well as the analysis of the results and the conclusions, were based on Vygotsky's historical-cultural approach and on other studies regarding mathematical language and the utilization of reading and writing in mathematics classes. The categories that emerged from the analysis of the data were the construction of mathematical knowledge, semantics of the mathematical terms, values and the potentiality of the activities. Considering all the categories, the results indicate that the process can make the relationship among teacher and students more interactive and effective for the construction of mathematical knowledge.","High School Mathematics; Historical-cultural Approach; Mathematics in Contexts; Portfolio Book; Reading and Writing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863809674

The article discusses if the difficulties in mathematics are associated with problems in specific components of working memory, or are related to a general deficit of the system, considering the model proposed by Baddeley and Hicht. It analyzes the diversity found in research results linking working memory to mathematics difficulties, pointing out possible reasons for this situation. It discusses the role that working memory plays in learning mathematics emphasizing that this ability is directly linked to other cognitive processes that are also fundamental to proper mathematical performance, such as processing speed and the recovery of arithmetic facts from long-term memory. The development of more research relating working memory to learning difficulties in mathematics is essential because it enables progress in the processes of prevention and intervention.","Learning Difficulties; Mathematics; Working Memory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863809673

This article aims to study the characteristics of families with and without records of child labor registered in the Bolsa-Escola Program in Belo Horizonte city, and to compare the two groups in order to identify factors possibly associated with child labor. It is a cross-sectional study of 9,252 families that took part in the Program from 2003 to 2006. It were analyzed the characteristics of the home, the mother and family. Among the 9,252 families studied, 1,293 (13.9%) had a record of child labor. There was positive relationship between the occurrence of child labor and the greatest number of people in the house, the absence of the husband at home, low level of maternal education, and labor market insertion of the mother. Despite the consolidation of the Program, child labor still exists in these families. In addition to poverty, other factors may contribute to child labor.","Bolsa-Escola Program; Cash transfer program; Child labor",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863432351

One of the procedures is based on the rates of completion at fundamental, secondary and higher education. This procedure, which relies on knowledge of the population distribution across several age groups and on the number of graduates at each education level, was used in the estimates related to the period before 1962. The other procedure is based on the number of years of schooling declared by the adult population, made available by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and was employed to estimate the number of years of schooling achieved by the education system in earlier periods. The good agreement between the results obtained with the two methods for the period between 1962 and 1999 demonstrates that they are consistent. The combination of the two procedures can give the results for a period of around 90 years, starting in the mid-1920s. The uncertainties of the results estimated both from fluctuations in the data used and from the numerical approximations made, are around 3%. Some of the details of the calculations are presented at the end of the work, in appendixes. The variations in the number of years of schooling, when larger than the uncertainties estimated, are associated to political, social or educational events that characterize the historical period analyzed.","Expected schooling; Secondary education; Years of completed schooling",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862690613

Thus, remarriage becomes a possibility for developing the family group which requires emotional, social and economic reorganization of the family, as well as greater flexibility to negotiate association, space, time and authority. The objective of this article was to describe the structure and dynamics of a stepfamily having a child with cerebral palsy, based on the members' representations of conflict situations. In this case study focused on a family, made up of three members: mother, son and stepfather. A semi-structured interview and the Family System Test (FAST) were applied. The FAST scores showed closeness in the mother-child dyad and distance in the stepfather-stepson dyad, with the hierarchy focused on the mother figure. As to the flexibility of boundaries, the couple's perception indicated rigid boundaries, both for the family and for parental systems, while the child's perception of the family system revealed diffused boundaries. Therefore, some factors highlighted in the literature and evident in this family such as differences in the couple's life cycle, short period of marriage, emotional baggage between mother and son, added to demands of child care, resources and biopsychological provisions, constituted a rigid standard with low flexibility, which made it difficult to include the stepfather in the group, resulting in less commitment to co-parenting in the care and education of the stepchild.","Cerebral palsy; Familiar conflict; Special education; Stepfamily",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861645812

This has led to a number of logistical and didactical challenges, in particular for computer science students. In this paper, the integration of some programmable logic concepts into an introductory digital electronics course is presented. The proposed optional lab develops a printed circuit board that implements a programmable logic block. Another contribution is the collaborative problem-solving methodology used to achieve this goal. Surveys completed by the students, and their final grades, show that the lab has improved the quality of their education and has contributed to a successful integration of programmable logic concepts in an introductory digital electronics course. Because of its demands on students' time and effort, the lab favors the most motivated students. This suggests future research on a proposal for a lab that would be feasible within the time constraints for even the least motivated students. © 2012 IEEE.","Active teaching; collaborative problem solving; digital electronics; engineering education; programmable logic","Collaborative problem solving; Computer science students; Digital electronics; Programmable logic; Technological advances; Time constraints; Undergraduate engineering; Undergraduate engineering students; Computer hardware description languages; Engineering education; Laboratories; Students; E-learning","Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT: PICT-2009-0041","Manuscript received February 07, 2011; revised April 28, 2011 and June 19, 2011; accepted August 01, 2011.

The course is offered as a remedial program for master's degree students of Computer Science. It was designed to meet the particular needs of the students entering the master's degree program, as a response to the lack of understanding of logical language which was identified in several previous cohorts of students at CENIDET. The course addresses mathematical abilities of comprehensive functional use of logical language as a basic ability to be developed for later successful participation in the Master of Computer Science and also for later use in professional contexts of Computer Engineering. Eighteen students distributed throughout Mexico volunteered to participate under the guidance of one instructor. The techno-pedagogical design of the course is grounded on two theoretical approaches. Content-related instructional decisions are supported by different concepts of the second generation of Activity Theory. The concept of Orienting Basis of an Action was particularly useful to define the skills the students were expected to develop. Instructional decisions related to the participants' interaction are underpinned by Slavin's Team Accelerated Instruction model.

The research is guided by the following general questions: How do students construct mathematical knowledge and how do teachers implement the methodology of Math Teaching-Learning-Evaluation through Problem Solving? Historical aspects of Problem Solving are very important in the configuration of the current trends for Problem Solving. One of them is the Methodology of Math Teaching-Learning- Evaluation through Problem Solving, based on clear foundations and an approach of renewal. In addition to that methodology, two aspects have been developed by the group: The conception of Math as a science of pattern and order and Discrete Mathematics. The knowledge constructed and the scientific production of GTERP prove its relevant contribution to intensifying dialogues between research and educational practice, students and teachers, and to increasing the possibilities of that practice particularly in Math work.","Math teaching-learning-evaluation; Problem solving; Research in math education; Research on problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873689803

An experimental methodology is purposed aiming to detect the falling down of oscillation amplitude and to fit these data to a mathematical model. The results show that the simple pendulum, set up by a small volume sphere and oscillating on low speed, can be studied with simplified models.

Data collection involved interviews with personnel from 19 municipal and state Boards of Education, from different regions of the country. The results showed that PCET are offered mainly to teachers who are working in the initial years of the basic schooling, system focusing primary on Portuguese and Mathematic. Two main perspectives were adopted: the individual one, which seeks to solve the difficulties and impasses presented in the classroom; and, the collaborative approach, which focuses predominantly on activities that take place in schools, emphasizing cooperative work. Most of these Boards of Education found that more enduring and systematic modalities of PCET are more productive in promoting teachers' learning, eventually leading them to modify their pedagogical practices. There were also many difficulties in evaluating and monitoring the PCET results. The conclusions indicate that, at the moment, the Boards of Education have to make simultaneous use of modalities aimed at the teacher and at the school as well as to strengthen internal educational policies that are better articulated and more harmonious with other teaching policies. These seem to be the best alternatives to upgrade the knowledge and skills of teachers, helping them to develop themselves in their profession.","Continuos educations; Teacher education; Teachers; Teaching and learning processes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861010243

Between 1994 and 2003 the increase in the number of institutions of higher education was of 118%; of 195% in the number of undergraduate courses, and of 207% in the number of Nursing undergraduate courses in the country. Between 1991 and 2004, the number of places in undergraduate Nursing courses jumped from 7,460 to 70,400, with an uneven distribution among the various Brazilian regions; such increase took place mainly in private institutions, linked to market interest, and without the evaluation and regulation process being fully implemented. Part of the members of the Commission believes that it is necessary to create more courses, since the number of nurses is still insufficient.

At the end of the lesson the student discovered by himself how to duplicate a square using the diagonal of the given one as the side of the new square. We studied empirically the reproducibility of this dialogue in educated adults and adolescents of the 21st century. Our results show a remarkable agreement between Socratic and empiric dialogues. Even in questions in which Meno's slave made a mistake, within an unbounded number of possible erred responses, the vast majority of participants produced the same error as Meno's slave. Our results show that the Socratic dialogue is built on a strong intuition of human knowledge and reasoning which persists more than 24 centuries after its conception, providing one of the most striking demonstrations of universality across time and cultures.

Psychiatry residents, as other specializing physicians, seem to be prone to suffering them. The prevalence of psychological symptoms among psychiatry residents has not been formally studied. Method: The authors studied the presence, frequency, and severity of psychological symptoms among psychiatry residents from a public psychiatric hospital in Mexico City, Mexico. The SLC-90 was answered by 92 residents; data were analyzed by SAS software, and gender differences were established. Results were compared with data from a previous study realized in the general Mexican population. Results: Interpersonal sensitivity, depression, obsessive-compulsive, and somatic worries were seen more frequently or more severely than other categories. Female residents reported symptoms more frequently. Conclusion: A significant portion of psychiatry residents reported psychological symptoms, although they described them as less frequent and less severe than found in the general Mexican population. In spite of this, interpersonal sensitivity was shown as the most severe symptomatic dimension in our sample, unlike findings in the general population.

Some claim that women are rather technophobic and that men are much better users of digital tools, while others argue that women enthusiastically embrace digital communication. This article puts this question to an empirical test. We analyze data sets from 12 Latin American and 13 African countries from 2005 to 2008. This is believed to be the most extensive empirical study in this field so far. The results are surprisingly consistent and revealing: the reason why fewer women access and use ICT is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions with respect to employment, education and income. When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"developing world; digitization; educational development; empowerment; gender issue; health services; information and communication technology; womens employment; womens status; Africa; Latin America","International Development Research Centre, IDRC","The author would like to thank the support of Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), which has been the driving force behind the creation of important statistics throughout the developing world for decades.

Hispanics constituted about 7% of undergraduate computer science and computer engineering graduates and 1% of doctoral graduates in 2007-2008. The small number of Hispanic faculty, combined with the lack of Hispanic role models and mentors, perpetuates a troublesome cycle of underrepresentation in STEM fields. In 2004, seven Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) formed the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) to consolidate their strengths, resources, and concerns with the aim of increasing the number of Hispanics who pursue and complete baccalaureate and advanced degrees in computing areas. To address barriers that hinder students from advancing, CAHSI defined a number of initiatives, based on programs that produced promising results at one or more institutions. These included the following: a CS-0 course that focuses on adoption of a three-unit pre-CS course that uses graphics and animation to engage and prepare students who have no prior experience in computing; a peer mentoring strategy that provides an active, collaborative learning experience for students while creating leadership roles for undergraduates; an undergraduate and graduate student research model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team, and professional skills and knowledge required for research and cooperative work; and a mentoring framework for engaging undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and onto the professoriate. CAHSI plays a critical role in evaluating, documenting, and disseminating effective practices that achieve its mission. This paper provides an overview of CAHSI initiatives and describes how each addresses causes of underrepresentation of Hispanics in computing. In addition, it describes the evaluation and assessment of the initiatives and presents the results that support CAHSI's claim of their effectiveness. © 2011 ACM.",,"Collaborative learning; Computer engineering; Cooperative works; Effective practices; Evaluation and assessment; Graduate students; Graduate studies; Hispanics; Peer-mentoring; Prior experience; Professional skills; Role model; STEM fields; Transition point; Animation; Engineering research; Information dissemination; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82455167732

Historically, societies have encouraged or discouraged certain doctorates according to their ever changing needs.It is fair to say that education and the economy are inextricably intertwined. In recent decades, an increasing number of books and papers have focused on the decline of Argentinean education, including higher education. Unlike the rest of the world, where tourism is recognised as a scientific discipline, this is not generally the case in Argentina. My thesis here is that the State plays a confusing role because on one hand it promotes tourism as a fertile source for the economy, highlighting its importance in the multiplier effect, but at the same time, it does not consider tourism as a scientific career at the Argentine Council of Technology and Scientific Research. This represents a serious constraint for the advancement of the discipline, encouraging many researchers to migrate abroad in search of opportunities. Low salaries and lack of opportunities to engage in research are two additional issues that prompted me to write this short perspectives paper. © Journal of Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism Education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80655136091

Being physics a matter lying on the grounds of technical engineering it becomes naturally appropriate to introduce the use of calculus and programming as useful tools in the context of a physics problem. This can be accomplished by moving some Practical Classes of Physics (problem solving) into the computer pool and by reformulating the physics problems in order to make them more appropriate for this kind of approach. In this environment, students put together, for instance, programming tools and numerical methods, along with the physical laws in order to address more realistic models, different from those which can usually be treated on the blackboard. This kind of computational physics problems increases the motivation of the engineering students by embedding them into sceneries whose models are closer to those real problems they will be facing later in their professional and scientific life. This is particularly relevant for the first year of the engineering careers when the development of this kind of professional skills is usually skipped. In the present work we will illustrate these ideas by means of the known problem of ""The motion of a body subject to air drag force"".

This article describes the redesign of the CBDEP at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry. As part of the formative evaluation of this CBDEP, information on clinical productivity was collected in order to educate intramural faculty members about the scope and extent of services provided in extramural sites; develop an understanding of the productivity expected; complement the intramural education by placing dental students in particular settings where they could enhance certain clinical disciplines; and serve as a decision making tool in the selection of sites that provide the richest clinical experiences. A total of 158 students participated in the CBDEP during the three years of our study (2006-08). Productivity per site was calculated based on total, mean, and median number of services provided, billing (utilizing Kentucky's Medicaid fees for 2006), and Relative Value Units (RVUs). A total of 26,202 services, $972,109 in billing, and 43,053 RVUs was generated by the students, with an average of 175 services, $6,481, and 287 RVUs per student. Four categories (restorative, oral surgery, preventive, and diagnostic) accounted for 88 percent of total RVUs for all sites and all years. Productivity measured with RV U was the highest at private practices. Students spent most of their time providing restorative and oral surgery services. Measuring clinical productivity can be an effective tool to establish benchmarks, improve the site selection process, and educate those skeptical about the benefits of extramural education. Such an evaluation will enable faculty and program administrators involved in CBDEP to make continuous improvements.","Access to care; Clinical education; Clinical productivity; Community dentistry; Community-based dental education; Dental education; Public health dentistry; Service-learning","analysis of variance; article; community care; dental care; dental student; economics; education; health care delivery; health care planning; human; medicaid; organization and management; reimbursement; statistics; United States; Analysis of Variance; Community Dentistry; Community Health Services; Efficiency, Organizational; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Kentucky; Medicaid; Medically Underserved Area; Preceptorship; Relative Value Scales; Students, Dental; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052509042

We discuss who the research subjects are in mathematics education research. The results suggest that: (a) cyberspace is a natural environment in an online RPG context; (b) the playful process in online learning in mathematics education brings important new aspects to our understanding of mathematical knowledge as a social construction; (c) the investigation becomes a game; (d) research subjects are who they want to be while they are in flow, that is, there is intentionality; (e) the challenge of research methodology inside cyberspace must be faced by researchers; and (f) the researcher needs to consider those different identities as integral to the research process. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Mathematics education; Online education; Online identities; Qualitative research methodology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051470933

We finished with the analysis of the institutional conditions and restrictions on the mathematic activities imposed by the schools. This paper approaches the curricular, factual and institutional dimensions. It allows us to postulate what might be considered to be a didactic phenomenon by its degree of generality and its direct entailment with a specific strategy of education of mathematics (Brousseau, 1983).

The methodological approach used was action research with the participation of 28 teachers. Lessons were observed and written protocols collected. Analysis of the results revealed the feasibility of the sequence, as the subjects were able to observe, through random experimentation, that the relative frequency is an estimate of the theoretical probability. Comparison of the graphs, on transparencies, allowed the teachers to note the existence of a common pattern that approximates the theoretical probability, allowing an evolution and appropriation of the probability concept.

We use a unique dataset from the Colombian Ministry of Education that includes all enrolled college students in the country between 1998 and 2008. Logistic regression is used to identify the correlation between receiving different forms of financial aid on the dropout rates of the students. The main results of the study suggest that the probability of dropping out decrease between 25 and 29% according to the type of financial aid received. There is also evidence that the financial aid is more effective in reducing dropout rates at the beginning of the student's college careers. This result holds after controlling by type of postsecondary institution attended.

In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed that assists in the design and classroom integration of educational games. The framework addresses both the educational dimension and the ludic dimension. The educational dimension employs Bloom's revised taxonomy to define learning objectives and applies the classroom multiplayer presential game (CMPG) pedagogical model while the ludic dimension determines the gaming elements subject to constraints imposed by the educational dimension. With a view to validating the framework, a game for teaching electrostatics was designed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An evaluation based on pre/post testing found that the game increased the average number of correct answers by students participating in the experiment from 6.11 to 10.00, a result found to be statistically significant. Thus validated, the framework offers a promising basis for further exploration through the development of other games and fine-tuning of its components. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With this aim in view, an online repository/platform was developed to gather various dynamic geometry resources, based on the idea of a teachers' community feeding the repository, (re)using available resources and sharing practices related to the use of dynamic geometry in classrooms. The repository is thus open to contributions of any user who can deposit, browse, download and use resources, which naturally raises the question how to handle the resource quality issue in such an open environment. This paper reports on the way we tackled this issue in the Intergeo project. We first explain what we mean by a ""good quality"" dynamic geometry resource. We then provide a rationale behind the design of a questionnaire, the main tool for resource quality reviews, which are at the core of the quality assessment process implemented in the repository. Several experiments carried out with groups of teachers in order to confront our research-based view of the resource quality with the teachers' one and to observe teachers' usages of the quality assessment process are also reported in the paper. The outcomes of these experiments highlight strengths and limitations of the resource quality assessment process. They also tend to show that the idea of involving teachers into the resource quality assessment is a promising way of stimulating the use of dynamic geometry in classrooms, provided that teachers benefit from a support to make the quality process their own. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2011.","Dynamic geometry; i2geo platform; Pedagogical resource; Quality assessment process",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867480773

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research was carried out based on a descriptive scope. The process of mapping federal universities in Brazil was carried out using data available in the Cadastro das Instituições de Educação Superior (General Register of Undergraduate Institutions), on the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais - INEPE (National Institute for Educational Studies and Research) web site. Then, researchers collected business administration curricula from the universities' web sites. The present study was based on 40 of the 45 universities first considered, which represents 89 percent of the programs offered in Brazil. After data collection - performed from July to August 2009 - a qualitative analysis of the curriculum was carried out. Findings: The inclusion of new courses that involve sustainability in business administration programs is still irregular and slow. Of the 40 universities investigated, only 13 (around 33 percent) offered courses related to the topic. Research limitations/implications: The nature of the research does not allow generalizations regarding other public or private undergraduate institutions. Practical implications: Results denote a deficiency in relation to the adoption of required courses on sustainability. This gap in the curriculum may compromise the ability of business administration students - who are the future managers and strategists - to reflect on the role of organizations in society. Originality/value: The present study is the first to examine the teaching of sustainability in Brazilian business education. It also contributes to monitoring the performance of Brazilian federal universities in the teaching of sustainability in business administration programs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bachelor Degree in Business Administration; Brazil; Curricula; Federal universities; Sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960290549

We argue that cognition is both embodied and situated in the activities through which it occurs and that mathematics learning involves the appropriation of practices associated with the sets of artefacts that have historically come to represent the body of knowledge we call mathematics. This process of appropriation involves a coordination of a variety of the semiotic resources-spoken and written languages, mathematical representation systems, drawings, gestures and the like-through which mathematical objects and relationships might be experienced and expressed. To highlight the connections between perceptual activities and cultural concepts in the meanings associated with this process, we concentrate on learners who do not have access to the visual field. More specifically, we present three examples of gesture use in the practices of blind mathematics students-all involving the exploration of geometrical objects and relationships. On the basis of our analysis of these examples, we argue that gestures are illustrative of imagined reenactions of previously experienced activities and that they emerge in instructional situations as embodied abstractions, serving a central role in the sense-making practices associated with the appropriation of mathematical meanings. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abstraction; Blind mathematics learners; Embodied cognition; Gestures; Mediation",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2004/15109-9; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 23038.019444/2009-33","4We are grateful to the funding we have received from FAPESP (Project no. 2004/15109-9) and CAPES (Project no. 23038.019444/2009-33) in the course of this programme of research.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956317606

A sample of 2671 students was drawn from 11 schools (grades 5-12). The results suggest a decline across school levels in students' perceptions of the value of music, and an increase across school levels in perceptions of task difficulty and parental expectations of effort in test-driven school subjects (i.e., mathematics, Korean, science). These trends among South Korean student motivational profiles may demonstrate the impact of high-stakes college entrance examinations. Students reported high parental expectations for student success in rigorous academic subjects, which might have negatively influenced students' values towards non-tested subjects such as music, art and physical education (P.E.). However, the high ranking of interest in music as a subject, along with relatively stable reported interest in music over time, suggests that South Korean students have a notable interest in music learning, but it is likely that the emphasis on examinations in South Korea may minimize the potential for exploration or expansion of this interest. © The Author(s) 2011.","competence beliefs; cross-cultural comparisons; expectancy-value theory; motivation; music education; school subjects; self-beliefs; task difficulty; testing; values",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959441726

The authors analyze the effect of private voucher education on students who are forced to enroll at a different school to attend secondary education once graduated from primary schooling-structural switches. Moreover, the data set the authors use in this article contains information on previous academic achievement and thus allows them to identify differences in students' unobservable characteristics. Using a number of propensity-score-based econometric techniques and the changes-in-changes estimation method, the authors find that private voucher education leads to small, sometimes not statistically significant differences in academic performance. The estimated effect of private voucher education amounts to about 4% to 6% of one standard deviation in test scores.

The same is addressed in a context of diversity in Venezuela, in effect set out different theoretical perspectives of sex education, which has helped the contrast with the concept of what teachers and families, leading us to identify categories that helped shape a concept of comprehensive sex education. Method: Through descriptive-ethnographic research explores the political perspective, policy and practice on courses of action in sex education is handled at the level of the curricula of primary and secondary education. Also analyzes the strategies that teachers, parents and the family used to promote sex education of schoolchildren and their impact on parents and community. The study focused on a sample represented by 20 students, 20 teachers and 15 families belonging to two schools that offer primary and secondary education, located in the town Barinas, Barinas State (Venezuela). The information was collected through diaries, interviews and questionnaires with open questions. Data were collected over a school year using the techniques and instruments have facilitated the organization, categorization and analysis of information, with support from the tools provided by descriptive statistics. Results: The concept of sex education that manage schools, teachers and families is colored by his experience, experiences, culture and traditions, which has led to essentially the meaning given to it is obviously particular to identify and focus on a conception of sexuality with reproductive purposes only. The school primarily promotes information that training in sexual education, the actions are focused on the fulfillment of curricular objectives, in most cases cognitive domain, and parental involvement is limited or almost nil. Discussion and Conclusions: From the analysis leads to some assumptions that help us to design intervention plans and programs in comprehensive sex education from the earliest years of life, involving the school and its immediate environment, developing plans, programs and educational projects for collectively take ownership of the concept of wholeness that represents the sexual education. It also raises the schools need to take before each school year a program of comprehensive sex education intervention which valued the experience, experience, knowledge and information received in the school, family and community, in order to appropriate sexual orientation strategies with more social. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (Spain).","Construction of meaning; Diversity; Integrity; Sexual education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955977920

The length of the work-school coexistence is one of the bases of that matter. In Brazil, the problem emerged in the 1990s with singular contours. In this country, the very expansion of schooling allowed youth to combine their recent school experiences with work, the most important institution of socialization of young people until then. This paper analyzes this issue based on two movements: through the constitution of the notion of youth as a social and analytical position in the Brazilian society and, secondly, by the use of the ""tool"" to analyze the relative importance of school and work in the transition from youth to adulthood, based on the case study of a specific group of youths from the periphery of Rio de Janeiro.","Social inequalities; Socialization processes; Youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054858315

First, a parallel was made between the history of academic characterization of physical education in North America and in Brazil. Next, the analysis of the areas comprehended by graduate study programs was carried out in the field around Brazil. A survey was done considering the field of concentration and its interface and links with the size of faculty, with research lines and with research projects. Physical education is the most preferred term to name the majority of the Brazilian graduate programs in contrast with the United States where Kinesiology is preferred. The analysis of the field of concentration yields three main subfields: biodynamics, sociocultural and pedagogical. Biodynamics takes precedence as one considers the size of the faculty and the number of research lines and projects always greater than the same variables in comparison with sociocultural and pedagogical subfields. This hegemony reflects a trend in which natural sciences-oriented research is privileged over human and social sciences-oriented research and difficulty in valuing the intervention, especially in schooling. This portrait resembles what happens in the US as some North American scholars from the sociocultural and pedagogical subfields have also identified difficulties in making their theoretical and methodological conceptions compatible with the hegemonic modes of thinking and investigation in kinesiology.","Biodynamics; Graduate studies; Kinesiology; Physical education; Scientific policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053016434

The investigation has tried to understand the dynamics and influence of Brazilian NGOs, more specifically in the area of reading, having in mind the development of literacy. To such end, a qualitative study of ethnographic features was conducted based mainly on field observations of the activities of an organization, which were analyzed from the perspectives of reading proposed by the theoreticians of psycholinguistics (SMITH, 1999, 2003) and of the aesthetics of reception (JAUSS, 1994, 2002). The aim was one of contributing to the studies about reading and, in particular, of advancing in the new possibilities of education given to us today by the civil society, which have encouraged the search for alternative solutions to a problem that has plagued Brazilian educators for decades. It is considered that through the exchange of ideas and experiences, and through the implementation of projects involving reading, the educational NGOs can contribute to develop a good quality public school without, however, replacing it, leaving to the state its due responsibility.","Literacy; NGO; Public school; Reading",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053015229

Our hypothesis is that via carefully designed computational explorations within an appropriately constructed medium, infinity can be approached in a learnable way that does not sacrifice the rigour necessary for mathematical understanding of the concept, and at the same time contributes to introducing the real spirit of mathematics to the school classroom. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Cardinality; Constructionism; Infinity; Programming; ToonTalk","Cardinalities; Computational exploration; Computational model; Constructionism; Design and implementations; Infinity; Programming activities; ToonTalk; Computer programming; Mathematical programming; Students","European Commission, EC","Acknowledgments The WebLabs project was funded by Grant IST 2001-3220 of the Information Society Technologies Programme of the European Commission.

The authors analyzed the effect of class attendance on academic performance and evaluated the existence and importance of a minimum attendance requirement. Using student data from a sample of public primary schools in Chile, and considering for endogeneity and sample selection bias, they found two important results. First, attendance had a relevant and statistically significant effect on educational performance. Second, the existence of a threshold was identified, but educational performance did not continue to decrease after a certain number of absences, which seems to contradict policies that have a minimum attendance requirement.

Geometry curriculum is identified as a problem (DETIENNE, 2000) traversing the two countries, and consequently a privileged source for comparative studies. Four textbooks for the lower levels of secondary school were analysed. Two authors keep their proposals for geometry teaching - António Palma Fernandes and Osvaldo Sangiorgi - and two other textbooks - one from António de Almeida Costa e Alfredo Osório dos Anjos and another produced by a group of teachers in Bahiaintegrate the new ideas deeply changing the geometry course. We conclude that curriculum development through textbooks does not linearly follow international recommendations, even when these are not uniform, as is the case of geometry during the Modern Mathematics Movement. Productions of this new curricular moment hybridize external influences producing new cultural entities that are not mere copies of the international curricular suggestions. Instead, they diversify with variable degrees of success, adapting to the contingencies of each educational system.","Brazil; Modern Mathematics Movement; Portugal; Teaching geometry",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958150313

It is rooted in both the biomedical sciences and the social sciences, each with their own scientific language. A more unique feature of medical education (and assessment) research is that it has to be both locally and internationally relevant. This is not always easy and sometimes leads to purely ideographic descriptions of an assessment procedure with insufficient general lessons or generalised scientific knowledge being generated or vice versa. For medical educational research, a plethora of methodologies is available to cater to many different research questions. This article contains consensus positions and suggestions on various elements of medical education (assessment) research. Overarching is the position that without a good theoretical underpinning and good knowledge of the existing literature, good research and sound conclusions are impossible to produce, and that there is no inherently superior methodology, but that the best methodology is the one most suited to answer the research question unambiguously. Although the positions should not be perceived as dogmas, they should be taken as very serious recommendations. Topics covered are: types of research, theoretical frameworks, designs and methodologies, instrument properties or psychometrics, costs/acceptability, ethics, infrastructure and support. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",,"article; consensus development; education; human; medical education; methodology; organization and management; reproducibility; research; research ethics; system analysis; Consensus Development Conferences as Topic; Education, Medical; Educational Measurement; Ethics, Research; Humans; Probability Theory; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Research Design","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 21590757, 23590630",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952033921

The literature on selection is limited and is not strongly theoretical or conceptual. For written testing, there is evidence of the predictive validity of Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) for medical school and licensing examination performance. There is also evidence for the predictive validity of grade point average, particularly in combination with MCAT for graduate entry but little evidence about the predictive validity of school leaver scores. Interviews have not been shown to be robust selection measures. Studies of multiple mini-interviews have indicated good predictive validity and reliability. Of other measures used in selection, only the growing interest in personality testing appears to warrant future work. Widening access to medical and health professional programmes is an increasing priority and relates to the social accountability mandate of medical and health professional schools. While traditional selection measures do discriminate against various population groups, there is little evidence on the effect of non-traditional measures in widening access. Preparation and outreach programmes show most promise. In summary, the areas of consensus for assessment for selection are small in number. Recommendations for future action focus on the adoption of principles of good assessment and curriculum alignment, use of multi-method programmatic approaches, development of interdisciplinary frameworks and utilisation of sophisticated measurement models. The social accountability mandate of medical and health professional schools demands that social inclusion, workforce issues and widening of access are embedded in the principles of good assessment for selection. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",,"article; consensus development; education; human; interview; medical school; organization and management; school; Consensus Development Conferences as Topic; Educational Measurement; Humans; Interviews as Topic; School Admission Criteria; Schools, Health Occupations; Schools, Medical",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952020286

Similar observations are made with the optical projections obtained in photography and video. Artists have intuitively corrected these perceptual shortcomings of perspective. In standard perspective, each point of an object or scene is projected upon a plane by means of a bundle of straight projection rays departing from a viewpoint. In the nonstandard perspective that I have developed, I follow a similar procedure, except that I replace the straight projection rays of standard perspective with special curved ones. This model has been validated by visual experiments in the open field. The next step will integrate the nonstandard perspective into a new kind of digital camera which will allow the user to select a preferred perspective by changing an index from i = 0 (conical) up to i = 1 (parallel). © 2011 The Author.

Results show that the availability of basic infrastructure and services (water, electricity, sewage), didactic facilities (sport installations, labs, libraries), as well as the number of books in the library and computers in the school do have an effect on the achievement of primary education students in Latin America, but their relative weight varies significantly from country to country.

We wanted to design a project that exploits the idea of a hands-on relationship between mathematics and technology to teach students the concept of 'transmission coefficient' in schools. Our purpose was to bridge mathematical knowledge and mechanical parts in technological devices. Our belief was that visual-tangible representations enhance human cognition by scaffolding the information process. We supplied a kit with rubber foam (Fomi) and balsa wood parts to construct an analogical clock. This included a series of gears to work with three different ratios. The project was conducted in 2007 and 2008, with 38 students ranging from 10 to 14 years of age. The students were from the 5th and 7th grades in two different schools. The project included six stages of both theory and hands-on work. In a final stage, the students were given a written test. All students were able to make workable systems of their design for a time-measuring device. This proved important for technological education. On the other hand, manipulating gears along with visual reasoning strategies allowed all students to achieve an understanding of operations with fractions.

The term stochastic has been used to refer to the interrelationship of the concepts of combinatorics, probability and statistics. Although the study emphasized the teaching and learning of probability and statistics, this text describes the activities related to the probabilistic study. The research was qualitative, with interpretive analysis based on categories that emerged from the empirical part: simulation, interaction and problem-solving. The analytic process converged with the preparation of a case study of a group of four students with whom the activities were developed, and the following problem was investigated: how can technology resources be useful for the construction of new knowledge about stochastic in the elementary school? To answer this question we used Vygotsky's perspective, considering that learning activities can promote learning through internalization. Thus, the process focused on the interaction having the collective dimension and the support of technological resources. It became evident that the inclusion of these resources generates broader and accurate knowledge but requires a teacher with much deeper theoretical and methodological knowledge on the subject.

We emphasize that, for this to occur, it is important to detail the domains and the borders between these profiles, but also to encourage movement between them and intensify relations between math, statistics, pedagogy, ethics and professional education in university-level math programs.

This article presents a set of interaction analysis strategies, which were designed during the development of a doctoral thesis in response to the two challenges identified: First, how can interaction be observed? And second, how can interaction be related to academic performance? The strategies designed provide elements for the analysis of educational activities, of asynchronous on-line discussions, of interaction representation and of the relationship between interaction and academic performance. For the analysis of educational activities, elements of sociocultural activity theory were used. For asynchronous on-line discussions, a content analysis of discussion transcripts was performed using a group of categories reflecting the knowledge construction process. Interaction was represented using the forograma technique, which is an alternative strategy for evaluating on-line discussion forums. The relationship between interaction and academic performance was established by comparing interaction dynamics and the academic performance results of the groups selected. Finally, an example is given to show how the strategies are applied.","Asynchronous discussions; Blended learning; Forogramas; Hybrid environments; Interaction; Interaction analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-82955178658

From the above comment the objective of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of postural deviation in students in the initial phase of adolescence and its possible relation to the weight of the backpack carried every day. To the attainment of this objective this study, 36 students aged 11 from the city of Ji-Paraná- RO (State of Roraima) were submitted to the instrument of postural evaluation (IPA), proposed by Liposcky Tosa Neto and Savall (2007), and in sequence, were evaluated in relation to their corporal weight with and without their backpacks using a digital scale manufactured by Cauduro, model: EB9009, based on paragraph III, art. 2° of the Project of Law 106/201. The height of the students was also verified, by means of a transportable stadiometer, manufactured by Cardiomed with 212 cm and the precision of 0.1 cm, in order to classify the weight carried by the students as correct or incorrect. The results show that 83.3% of the participants carry, daily, an inadequate weight in their backpacks, and that only 16.7% of the students do it in the correct way. It is possible to establish a positive correlation between the backpack's weight (of the 36 participants in this study) and the number of postural alterations presented by them, through a coeficient of correlation that is relatively around one ( +1) (p-value<0,0001).","Adolescents; Evaluation; Postural deviations",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054733903

The evaluation process for verification of the INAF was developed in 2001, by Paulo Montenegro Institute, organization of IBOPE (Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion), together with the NGO Educative Action. The Brazilian population classified as literate, by self-declaration in the official census, is not always familiarized with the abilities of writing, reading and interpretation of texts and numbers to understand the economic and social context in which it is inserted. The INAF classifies the functional literacy in four levels: illiterate, rudimentary, basic, and fully literate. The Indicator, through questionnaires and tests, that portray every day problems, evaluates the abilities to interpret and to solve problems of literacy and numbering in a sample of the population of the agricultural and urban zones, between the ages of 15 and 64. The evaluation was developed based on the categories and standards established by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation and to support the modeling of the research process, the heuristic V of Gowin was used, which provides us with a cognitive analysis of the verification of the literacy indicator. The study concluded that the INAF is a complete and trustworthy indicator, capable to portray Brazil's functional literacy and to contribute with statistical analyses and evidences to guide educational policies for adults and youngsters. The study recommends more exposure of INAF results in mass communication media, with the purpose of creating more impact on the INAF itself and generating debates for decision making in the educational area.","Functional literacy; Literacy; Numbering",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054723781

It is well-known that to increase their cognitive performance, many students turn to substances with the objective of being able to stay up more hours with a sharp attention focused on their study. However, these substances can interfere long term memory and can generate pharmaceutical dependency. Aim. To establish the prevalence of the use of psychoactive substances in University students and to relate it with sleeping patterns and social-economic-educational characteristics. Subjects and methods. Cross-sectional study using standardized questionnaire with multiple choice system administered to 122 Anatomy students in the year 2009. Statistic parameters were applied and an informed consent was demanded. Results. 79.51% said that they were not able to read all the topics and 36.89% said that they memorized concepts; 25% started to memorize subjects three days before the exam, 20.49% did it the previous day, and 19.67% memorized subjects the night before the exam without sleeping. 25.41% answered that they used substances for sleeping and 41.8% used some substances to increase studying hours, such as: coffee, energy drinks, psychopharmacological medication (45.09% modafinil and methylphenidate) and acetylsalicylic acid. The numbers of hours working correlated with the number of substances consumed (r = 0.89); students that where taking the subject again had less hours of sleep indirectly correlated with the use of psychoactives (r = -0.86). Conclusions. We recorded a high prevalence of consumptions of psychoactive substances, especially amongst students that are repeating the course and students that had jobs. It is of utmost importance to implement pedagogical tools that increase motivation, attention, and the associative capacities under an integrative-educational conception. © 2011 Educación Médica.","Anatomy; Learning; Psychoactive substances; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052661774

The process of collecting data was done in a school in Lisbon through the application of four tasks accompanied by interviews. We organized the types of algebraic thinking expressed by the students in three main categories: Generalized Arithmetic, Functional Thinking and Modelling, and also in subcategories which emerged during the process of data analysis.

This allows tosketch a socio-historical scenario focusing on the practices that took place in a school that taught literacy and primary arithmetic.

The research, following a qualitative approach, was carried out in two elementary schools and one early childhood education school. The results show how, generally speaking, our current public policies have announced priority to the investments in fundamental schooling, without increasing their amount significantly, and how, at the same time, in the implementation of new measures, they disregard the school reality and fail to prepare it for the changes. Apart from the results of the study, this article also draws on the analysis of data coming from an undergraduate apprenticeship period conducted as part of the discipline of Early Childhood Education of a Pedagogy course at a public university of the State of São Paulo. Based then on the results of the research and on the analysis of apprentice periods, we discuss more specifically in this text how the extension of the fundamental education in this municipality, in the form it has taken place, has had negative impact on the pedagogical organization of early childhood education. We observe, for instance, that mechanical activities such as copying letters and numbers are been used more and more intensely under the argument that a preparation for fundamental education during pre-school is now even more necessary.","Early childhood education; Educational policies; Nine-year fundamental education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955407390

Students' interest and attitudes toward science as well as their perceptions of how well they will perform in learning contexts may play important roles in developing a meaningful understanding of scientific concepts, an understanding that goes beyond rote memorization toward the ability to explain everyday phenomena with current scientific knowledge. A worrying issue reported by researchers is that primary school students seem to have a positive attitude toward science, but this attitude diminishes gradually, so that upon arriving at secondary school it has changed to a negative attitude, mainly in females. The first stumbling block for research into attitudes towards science, is that such attitudes do not consist of a single unitary construct, but rather of a large number of pieces and contributions all of which contribute in varying proportions towards an individual's attitudes towards science. Several studies have incorporated a range of components in their measures of attitudes to science including: The perception of the science teacher; anxiety toward science; the value of science; self-esteem at science; motivation towards science; enjoyment of science; attitudes of peers and friends towards science; attitudes of parents towards science; the nature of the classroom environment; achievement in science; and fear of failure on course. Within the interest literature, the relationship between interest and learning has focused on three types of interest: Individual, situational, and topic. Individual interest is considered to be an individual's predisposition to attend to certain stimuli, events, and objects. Situational interest is elicited by certain aspects of the environment. These include content features such as human activity or life themes, and structural features such as the ways in which tasks are organized and presented. Topic interest, the level of interest triggered when a specific topic is presented, seems to have both individual and situational aspects. © Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.","Anxiety; Attitudes; Interest; Self-concept; Self-esteem",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Editorial,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953691800

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Hospital das ClinicasFaculty of MedicineUniversity of Sao Paulo, a tertiary institutional hospitalBrazil. Participants We reviewed 1,040 arterial operations performed during 2 distinct time periods: January 1995 to December 1996, and January 2006 to December 2007. Based on the disease treated, the procedures were classified into the following 5 groups: abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), aorto-iliac obstructive disease (AI), obstructive disease of the femoropopliteal-tibial segment (FP), carotid disease (C), and others (O). The operations were also divided into an endovascular surgery (ES) group and an open surgery (OS) group. We compared the number of open and endovascular procedures for each arterial disease group during both periods. Results During the 20062007 period, 654 patients were treated surgically, whereas over the 19951996 period, 386 arterial operations were performed. A significant increase in endovascular procedures (p < 0.001) was found from the 19951996 period to the 20062007 period (35 vs 351, respectively) in all groups, whereas open surgery showed a slight increase in the number of procedures in the AAA and O groups only. In the 19951996 period, OS was the primary surgical method for all groups, but in the 20062007 time frame, OS was performed more frequently than ES only in the AAA and O groups. Considering all vascular disease groups, OS was the technique used in 90.9% (351 of 386) of the operations during 19951996, whereas in 20062007, OS was performed in only 46.3% (303 of 654) of the procedures. Conclusions The increase in the number of ES observed over the past decade has had little impact on OS procedures performed at our medical center, not bringing harm to open surgical training. © 2011 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.","Medical Knowledge; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement","adult; aorta aneurysm; article; Brazil; carotid artery disease; cross-sectional study; endovascular surgery; female; general surgery; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; patient care; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; residency education; resident; surgical technique; surgical training; university hospital; vascular surgery; Age Factors; Aged; Brazil; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Medical, Graduate; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Internship and Residency; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Quality of Health Care; Risk Assessment; Sex Factors; Surgical Procedures, Elective; Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Surgical Procedures",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551549342

A total of 296 students responded (response rate=78.7 percent). Frequency analysis and chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies between the two time periods. Job conception was cited as the primary reason for pursuing dentistry, and the students considered oral health promotion and oral disease prevention as the primary purposes of dentistry. Most students intended to serve both high and low socioeconomic populations and both private and public practices after graduation. The majority cited an interest in specializing in clinical fields, orthodontics being the most frequent option. Significant trends included a greater interest in health promotion and public services and specializing in aesthetic dentistry and implantology in the 2006-08 period.

A study was conducted of behaviors before and after the participation of students in the project. The approach taken was fundamentally positivist, explicative and experimental, following a quasi-experimental design with a pre and post-test group and a control group. The population consisted of 100 students: 50 in the experimental group (EXP) and the same number in the control group (CON). A questionnaire was employed. The results were analyzed with the SPSS (17.0) to compare the medians of the groups through the t student test. The comparison of the pre-tests, EXP1 and CON1 was not significant (sig: 0.221), pointing to the homogeneity of the groups before community service intervention. The comparison between EXP2 and CON2 was significant (sig: 0.000) favoring the experimental group indicating that there had been a change in the group. The medians of the experimental groups, before (EXP1) and after community service (EXP2) were statistically different (sig. 0.000). No significant differences were observed between the pre-test (CON1) and the post-test (CON2) applied to the control group (sig. 0.091), which shows that the changes observed in the prosocial behaviors of the experimental group were probably due to the project of Community Service Learning applied. It is concluded that the implementation of the Law on Community Service of the Higher Education Student (2005) could effectively contribute to complementing student education at this level.","Community projects; Community service; Prosocial behavior; Venezuelanhigher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856160502

In our view, in order to construct a more inclusive mathematics education, it is necessary to understand the particularities of the learning processes of learners with limited or no access to the visual field. To this end, in this paper we present our attempts to elaborate materials which permit the tactile exploration of geometrical figures, so that blind learners might build understandings of the areas, perimeters and volume of a range of geometrical shapes.

The pedagogical triad Feeling-Perceiving, Relating- Concept ( F-P/ R/C ) co-related with the dynamism of the semiosis process, defined by Charles Sanders Peirce ( 1839-1914 ) in his semiotic theory on the production of the sign (Object, Representamen and Interpretant), enabled the interpretation and analysis of the students' inferences in the phase of perception (feel, admire), induction (experience), and deduction (concept).","Basic Education; Mathematical Language; Peircean Semiotic",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960219192

However, a number of municipal constitutions contain original contributions, both positive (increasing the minimum percentage of taxes to education) and negative (reduction of this percentage by means of amendments to the municipal constitutions.

This research aimed to investigate the importance and the meaning assigned by students to musical activities developed in school and non-school contexts. The method consisted of a survey, involving 21,975 students from eight countries (Brazil, China, Finland, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, South Korea, and the USA), which was based on the Eccles and Wigfield's expectancy-value model for motivation. The Brazilian sample consisted of 1848 students from the 6th grade of fundamental education to the 3rd grade of high school, from 11 cities of the Rio Grande do Sul state. These students belonged to three different cohorts of music learning. Those who had: (a) music in schools and as an extra-school activity; (b) music as a school subject; (iii) music as an outside school activity. Data collection was carried out through a 38-item questionnaire about the students' profile and their opinions on interest, importance, difficulty, utility, competence and confidence in relation to arts, science, physical education (PE), mathematics, Portuguese, and music. Data were examined using mixed-design Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs). Results show that the degree of interest, importance and utility of music increased as the students progressed through schooling, which contradicts data generated from this study in most of the other countries. Despite the interest of Brazilian students in music, arts and PE, they considered Portuguese, mathematics and science to be more important and useful. When compared to other countries, the results show that Brazilian students demonstrated a great value for music, despite the differences in the learning contexts of the three groups. Those students who only studied music in schools showed the lowest levels of interest, importance and utility. © The Author(s) 2010.","competence beliefs; cross-cultural comparisons; expectancy-value theory; motivation; music education; school subjects; self-beliefs; task difficulty; values",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650566605

Our general hypothesis is that retention of verbal information in working memory will vary as a function of the use made of gestures in children with mild intellectual disability, i.e., gestures congruent with the speaker's verbal expression will facilitate memory processes. To test this, we designed an experimental research study with 120 children with mild intellectual disability attending basic levels either in special education schools or mainstream schools. The results show significant differences (p < 0.05) in the immediate recall of the gesture associated to the verbal discourse. Children recalled a greater number of words and phrases when they were presented with a congruent gesture.

We conjectured that these two different emphases could be fruitful combined in a research and development process aimed at producing effective CSCL practices. We explored this possibility in a project that adapted a CSCL tool from Chile to serve as the basis of an effective 3-week classroom module for primary school mathematics in the United States. To go from tool to module, we addressed curricular fit, training materials, pedagogical guidance, formative and summative assessments, and logistical support. In conducting the project, we found that effectiveness and contextual research could be conducted simultaneously and yielded complementary insight to this design process, which enabled our project to rapidly move from the base tool towards complete classroom modules. An experiment we conducted after our design iterations showed that students who used the modules learned more about the target content, fractions. A retrospective analysis of our design process suggests that the Integrative Learning Design framework is useful for organizing the complementary components of effectiveness and contextual research in our design process. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The case is based on data collected by one of the authors in Argentina. The case is appropriate for senior-and level undergraduates as well as students in MBA and Executive Development programs. It is designed to be taught in a one hour and a half? class session, and is likely to require at least a couple hours of preparation by students. Case Synopsis: Mr. Pedro Gouzou is Vice President of Marketing for Renault Argentina S.A., the Argentine subsidiary of the French automobile assembler and marketer, Renault S.A. Due to Argentina's default on its sovereign debt and the subsequent deterioration in the economic environment in Argentina, Renault's sales of new cars in Argentina fell dramatically. In 2003, for the entire country of nearly 40 million people, demand in Argentina for new Renault vehicles averaged slightly more than 40 vehicles per day. At the end of 2004, however, with the Argentine economy now recovering quite strongly, Renault is eager to rebuild sales. Additional data and information in the case include: 1. For Argentina: Historical overview, a sample of recent statistics from the World Bank, and (for benchmarking purposes), comparable statistics for the United States. 2. For the company (at both local and global levels): Historical overview, current performance, and numerous factors impacting that performance. 3. Characteristics of the local company's current strategy, including descriptive information on the product line, characteristics of the distribution system, information on the promotion and pricing strategies the company is currently using, etc. 4.

The method is designed to identify references with high academic relevance in databases accessed via the internet, using a bibliometric analysis to sift the selected articles. Design/methodology/approach: The study is descriptive, in so far as its goal is to describe a method, and the nature of the paper is theoretical. The study incorporates an inductive logic, and draws on secondary data sources. The study combines qualitative and quantitative methods, and can therefore be described as mixed method. The research involves the application of a technical procedure. Findings: The method employed sifted a large number of potential resources identified in a search of the internet and, after 11 stages in the proposed process, 11 papers were identified as being relevant to the research topic and highly cited. Descriptive statistics are provided of where those articles were published, how extensively the authors of those papers were published, the nature of the journals in which the papers appeared, and scientific recognition (number of citations). Originality/value: The relevance of this work for HRD research is in the proposal for a structured process for identifying relevant academic articles relating to the research context, in the presentation of 11 highlighted articles in the area of training programs evaluation, in the identification of the main authors of this area of knowledge, and in the identification of the main journals that address the theme of the evaluation of training programs. Thus, practitioners, researchers and students can direct their attention to the articles, authors and journals that are most relevant to the theme of evaluation of training programs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Research work; Serials; Training; Training evaluation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956320233

Ministry of Education school census data indicates that the number of students with special needs enrolled in regular schools in the country has increased over the years, especially in the municipal system of education. Among the students regarded as having ""special needs"" are those with autism, who show impairment in social interaction, communication and stereotypical behavior patterns. The city of Belo Horizonte - MG has been taking action in order to improve access for students with autism in regular schools in the city, but data of the progress of this process is scarce. The purpose of this research was to characterize the students with autism enrolled in regular public schools in Belo Horizonte, as well as describe the way in which this schooling is occurring in regular schools, from the perspective of the teachers. Thirtythree teachers who had direct and daily contact with students with autism in regular schools in the city participated in this research. A semi-structured questionnaire and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used. The results indicated that the strategies used by the city seem to enable the presence of the students with autism in the schools, but there is evidence that their participation in school activities is restricted, the interactions with their peers is scarce, and the content learned from the school curriculum is limited.","Autism; Diagnosis; Educational inclusion; Special education; Student characteristics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952286349

Three treatment groups participated in learning activities developed by 3 institutions, which use 3 different literacy methods. The fourth group was a control group with activities of their schools without outside interference. In 2008, the project added new 1st grade students of the participating schools. The results will be presented in two proficiency scales obtained by the use Item Response Theory (IRT), one for reading and writing and the other for mathematics which describe the children's performance at the end of the 1st and 2nd grades. The main results show that there was a great gain in both proficiency scales between the 1st and 2nd grade. The Reading and Writing scale shows that writing abilities are attained at the highest levels of the scale, while reading abilities appear earlier, on lower levels.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory analysis was initially performed on the degree to which firms actually used human and structural capital indicators, through a survey sent out to Spanish firms with a staff of 25 employees or more. Subsequently, by means of an explanatory analysis, the relationship was studied between the use made of the aforementioned indicators and a set of variables selected as representative of value creation. The information on value creation was taken from the Sistema de Análisis de Balances Ibéricos (SABI-AMADEUS) database. Moreover, in an attempt to corroborate the results of this explanatory analysis, a further independent variable was simultaneously introduced taken from the financial statements held on the same database and applied to the same sample of firms; known as the value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC), it analyses value creation efficiency. Findings: The explanatory analysis of multiple lineal correlations and regressions allows us to confirm the positive relation that exists between the use of human and structural capital indicators, and value creation measured by sales growth. Simultaneously, higher levels of the VAIC, in particular for the component that refers to the sum of the coefficient of human capital and structural capital, are also related to improvements in competitiveness reflected through an increase in sales figures. Research limitations/implications: Despite having identified a relation between intellectual capital and value creation, the study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between the use of human capital and structural capital indicators and dependent variables other than sales growth, such as return on assets (ROA) or productivity. The authors would have preferred to have obtained information from a larger number of firms, which would perhaps have contributed to finding new significant relations. This limitation suggests that further research is needed, such as carrying out large-scale longitudinal studies using panel data analysis. Originality/value: This analysis has a dual perspective based on observations taken from a survey and economic-financial analysis. It is a novel study in the Spanish context given that the analysis of aspects related to intellectual capital have on numerous occasions centred on large and/or quoted firms in that country, solely using information taken from secondary sources (databases). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Human capital; Spain; Value added",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955297401

We compared group and individual feedback, using two technologies: (1) Technology-mediated, Peer-Assisted Learning (TechPALS), which uses wireless handheld technology to structure feedback in small groups as they solve fractions problems and (2) a popular desktop product, which provides feedback to individual students as they solve fractions problems individually. Three elementary schools participated in a randomized controlled experiment conducted in the 2007-2008 school year. Students in the TechPALS condition learned more than did the control group students, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.14 to d = 0.44.

The papers for this special issue focus mainly on this period. During these years, many trends have emerged in mathematics education to address the complex problems facing Brazilian society. However, most Brazilian mathematics educators feel that the separation of research into trends is a theoretical idealization that does not respond to the dynamics of the problems we face. We raise the conjecture that the complexity of Brazilian society, where pockets of wealth coexist with the most shocking poverty, has contributed to the adoption and generation of different strands in mathematics education, crossing the boundaries between trends. At a more micro level, we also raise the conjecture that Brazilian trends in research are interwoven because of the way that Brazilian mathematics educators have experienced the process of globalization over these 30 years.

Is the teacher aware of the use he/she has made of metaphors in his/her speech, and to what extent does he/she monitor them? The theoretical framework was based on embodied cognition theory. Our findings include teachers' expressions that suggest, among other ideas: (1) orientation metaphors, such as ""the abscissa axis is horizontal""; (2) fictive motion, such as ""the graph of a function can be considered as the trace of a point that moves over the graph"" (3) ontological metaphors; and (4) interaction of metaphors.

Having a society of oral tradition and a predominantly illiterate population, East Timor faces many challenges in the era of globalization. Given the importance of reading for the lives of human beings, Timorese children should be taught to read since the early years of schooling and in doing so the sociocultural and linguistic reality of the country should be taken into account. With a case study in Public School Number 1 Nularan, in Dili, East Timor, on teaching and learning to read in the first three years of schooling, it was observed that both the guidelines of the curriculum and the reference books used by the school to work with students do not foster the development of reflective reading nor offer opportunities for children to express their ideas or communicate using texts for group discussions. Thus, we suggest constant monitoring and evaluation of the teaching and learning to read process in primary schools and investment both in human resources training and in the improvement of teaching materials and school infrastructure. It is not enough to mention education in the Constitution and laws: the important thing is that competent authorities take action to deliver quality education to the East Timorese as active subjects in inventions and knowledge so that they have access to better lives for themselves and for the communities which they belong to.","East Timor; Nularan School; Reading; Teaching / learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649500279

Both are situated in the southernmost state of the country. One occurred during the mid-twentieth century, while the other connected to the Movimento Sem Terra (Landless Movement), a national social movement, emerged 25 years ago precisely in this part of the country. The study analyzes two events of those forms of life: imposing the Portuguese language on the German colonization schools during the time of the Nationalization Campaign (1939-1945) and the closing of the itinerant schools of the Landless Movement that happened recently. Using Later Wittgenstein ideas, some language games that constitute school mathematics and peasant mathematics in those two forms of life are described. Based on this description articulated with the discussion about Hardt and Negri's notion of differential inclusion, it is argued that school mathematics in those two different time-space forms of life works as a gear in the production of differential inclusion. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Differential inclusion; Foucaultian genealogy; German colonization school mathematics; Later Wittgenstein; MST mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960254537

Its scope is limited to the context of school mathematics and, more specifically, to an ongoing research programme which involves the development of collaborative research partnerships with teachers of mathematics. The paper begins with a brief presentation of the introduction of computers into the Brazilian educational scenario in the 1980s, highlighting how computer technology was heralded as a key to permitting new pedagogical approaches appropriate to the constructivist philosophy of that time. It goes on to consider recent developments in the theoretical frameworks used to interpret mathematics learning in the presence of digital technologies and the importance of focusing on the learning system as a whole, considering epistemological, cognitive and pedagogic dimensions concomitantly. In this vein, it is argued that for any real integration to take place, the mathematical practices afforded by digital tools must be considered legitimate by all the actors in this process and, perhaps most notably, by teachers. The rest of the paper focuses on our approaches to involve teachers in making decisions about technology use in their own classrooms. The strategy used was based on the realisation of research activities underpinned by the idea of the collaborative design of learning situations and the goal of including the wide diversity of learners that characterises Brazilian mathematics classrooms. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Collaborative design; Digital technologies; Embodied cognition; Inclusion; Mathematics learning",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2005/60655-4","Acknowledgments We would like to thank a number of our colleagues from the research group TecMEM for their valuable contributions to the research reported in this paper.

Based on some of the OECE's recommendations, we seek to identify how they were operationalized in Brazil and Portugal. The question is: What did experiences with the MM and the publication of textbooks represent in these countries? Therefore, we used the bibliography about MM, official documents found in the historical archives of Portugal, and an interview with a Modernization of Mathematics Period participant.","Comparative historical research; Modern mathematics; Pedagogical experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960243482

Through the analyses of this syllabus, we noted that the modern mathematics guidelines are present for the elementary school teaching although they arose after the international movement. Particularly, set theory serves as a means and support for teaching and learning, thus contributing to the continuation of the modern mathematics ensemble of ideas. This study allows the questioning of a history of marks, evidences and traces of a new mathematics linked to the teaching and to the ways of learning that nowadays are mixed so well in stipulated codes and signals that became natural in the teaching of that subject.","Elementary school teaching; History of the education and of the teaching of mathematics; Mathematics language; Modern mathematics; Set theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960241200

The present paper shows the importance of a joint use of pencil and paper activities and of technology so that students may develop a complete understanding of ratio and proportion. A previous experience with strategy use when solving ratio and proportion problems provided background. Prompted by a recognition of the cognitive components in students, we decided to offer support through the observation and manipulation of representations made using dynamic geometry software. Method. Application of three activities to be solved by a group of 29 sixth-grade pupils public, primary education in Mexico City. The activities were solved with paper and pencil and using dynamic geometry. Results. Students built figures proportional to others they were were given, using comparison by superimposing one figure over another, by dragging them, and by enlarging or reducing a figure by click-and-drag on one of its vertices. They also established numerically equivalent ratios by obtaining measurements for the figures given and making the comparison as a quotient. They also were able to recover data from the problems given and represent them using drawings, then they made use of these drawings to help them solve the assigned activity. Discussion and Conclusion. Most of the students could establish figures that were proportional to the ones given by using registers of representation, such as using drawings with the data that they were able to extract from the story problems, using a table which they filled in with both external and internal ratios, as well as equivalence relationships between the ratios and the operations used to get the numeric values. They also showed development in their qualitative proportional thinking as a support to quantitative proportional thinking. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (Spain).","Dynamic environment; Geometry; Proportion; Ratio; Representations",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957028538

Medical practitioners must play an active role in oral health promotion. Summary: Proper knowledge of oral diseases is crucial in medical practice due to the following reasons: (a) Periodontal disease is associated with multiple systemic conditions of medical interest, (b) a large number of systemic diseases have oral manifestations, (c) many drugs are associated with oral adverse drug reactions, (d) physicians are generally not sufficiently trained to detect oral cancer manifestations, (e) physicians could play a pivotal role in oral public health, and (f) early detection of oral diseases by physicians could improve the oral health status of the population. Conclusions: Physicians need to get more involved in oral health promotion.

This work presents a systems approach to a mechatronics design course at ITESM, México. In their final year, engineering students are taught a methodology to design a mechatronic product. The methodology includes: the early stages of clients' needs identification, process characterization, literature review, and ideas generation, which lead to both the design and simulation of the mechanical, electronic and control stages. This series of steps is inspired in a number of different design methodologies, which are available from the literature and can be adapted to the available tools and circumstances at the university. This paper describes a practical way to integrate the existing specialised techniques and tools to generate an efficient design of a mechatronic product. Some of the virtual tools that are available to design, evaluate and integrate the different parts of a mechatronic design are also discussed The systems approach was applied by the students to different mechatronic projects in industry, thus creating good links between university and manufacturing companies with satisfactory results.

The study takes the presentations from the last National Seminar of History of Mathematics as a starting point. Such event gathered researchers, in a more significant and comprising way, interested in historical studies of mathematics and its teaching. The characterization points at the existence of four different tendencies: a production that considers the studies about history of mathematics education as part of the research about history of mathematics; a trend of opinions that takes into account the pedagogical use of history in mathematics education and establishes conditions for the research in the history of mathematics education; studies that use oral history for mathematics teachers' training courses; and, finally, another trend that treats the history of mathematics education as history, that means, a specificity of historical production, having the mathematics education as an object. It will be shown that the characterization of those trends reveals different ways of representing the past of mathematics education, as well as the relationships Brazilian researches keep with international studies about this subject. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","History of mathematics; History of mathematics education; Oral history",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867561169

It has been speculated that these problems impair students' quality of life (QoL). The authors aimed to assess the health-related QoL (HRQL) of medical students throughout their 6 years of training at a school with a traditional curriculum. Methods Of a total of 490 students attending our institution's medical school, 38 were surveyed in February 2006 (incoming Year 1 group, surveyed when students were in the second week of Year 1 classes) and 352 were surveyed in February 2007 (students in Years 1-6). Students self-reported their HRQL and depressive symptoms using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Comparisons were performed according to year in training, presence of depressive symptoms, gender, living arrangements and correlations with family income. Results The students' ages ranged from 18 to 31 years (median 22.3 years). Students in Years 2, 3, 4 and 6 had lower scores for mental and physical dimensions of HRQL compared with the incoming Year 1 group (P < 0.01), with the largest difference observed for Year 3 students. Students with depressive symptoms had lower scores in all domains of the SF-36 (P < 0.01). Female students had lower HRQL scores than males (P < 0.01). No differences were observed for students living with versus without family and no correlation with family income was found. Conclusions Major impairments in HRQL were observed among Year 3 students, students with depressive symptoms and women. Medical schools should institute efforts to ensure that students' HRQL and emotional support are maintained, particularly during critical phases of medical training. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2010.",,"adolescent; adult; anxiety; article; cross-sectional study; depression; emotion; female; health status; human; male; medical student; mental stress; psychological aspect; psychometry; quality of life; statistics; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Emotions; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77149172873

A sample of 120 children, divided into two age ranges (7 - 8 and 11 - 12 years) participated in the study. In each age range, half of the participants received picture drawings as stimuli, and the other half received words. In phase I, the stimuli were presented to participants, and they were told they could do whatever they wanted to try and learn them; they were later asked to recall them. In phase II, the stimuli were presented to participants, and they were asked to sort them according to their size, phonology or semantic characteristics; later they were asked to recall them. Better recall was observed in the older participants when drawings were used, and when instructions to sort items according to a semantic criteria were provided. A higher ratio of clustering was obtained in the older participants and when instructions to sort items according to semantic characteristics were provided. The concept of utilisation deficiency seems to depend on the task and material employed. Although the use of drawings equalled the clustering of stimuli in two age groups, this resulted in better recall for the older children. © 2010 Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Children; Drawings; Levels of processing; Memory strategies; Utilisation deficiency; Words",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954381303

As a way to improve this situation, several institutions have been implementing programs to attract and keep students in science and technology majors. This work describes a high-performance computing (HPC) course intended for secondary school students,which requires only the most basic infrastructure. In this hands-on workshop, the students learn how to assemble, install, and test a cluster. In parallel, students are exposed to a complete new area of knowledge, obtaining a more accurate view of the discipline of computer science and increasing their confidence in their ability to follow computer science. This course also provides opportunities for students to meet scientists and lose any misconceptions and negative stereotypes about science in general and computer science in particular. The aim of this paper is to detail the key concepts conveyed to students, share the course organization, materials, and examples used, and describe the overall experience. © 2009 IEEE.","Cluster; Computer science education; High-performance computing (HPC); Outreach; Secondary school education; Vocational guidance","Cluster computer; Course organization; Hands-on experiences; High-performance computing; Science and Technology; Secondary schools; Computer science; Education computing; Employment; Engineering education; Teaching; Students","Fundación YPF, YPF","Manuscript received September 22, 2008; revised May 07, 2009.

These programs aim to influence the accumulation of human capital, as well as reduce poverty. In terms of educational outcomes, a number of impact evaluation studies have shown that such programs have led to an increase in school enrollment, ensured regular school attendance and led to a reduction in child labor. Theoretically, such cash transfer programs may also be expected to exert a positive impact on students' test scores, but related empirical evidence is scarce. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano of Ecuador, on students' cognitive achievements. The paper uses a regression discontinuity strategy to identify the impact of the program on second grade cognitive achievement. Regardless of the specification and sample used, we find no impact of the program on test scores, suggesting that attempts at building human capital, as measured by cognitive achievement, require additional and alternative interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, we briefly illustrate how the medium is related to the scientific production of mathematical knowledge. We take a detour into the world of art to examine how devices and instruments have historically been associated with the production of mathematical knowledge. Then, we review studies on the history of education to show how traditional media were introduced into schools and have influenced education. In particular, we examine how devices such as blackboards and notebooks, which were novelties a 100 years ago, came to be accepted in schools and the mathematical activities that were promoted with their use.

It is assumed that differences between oral and written modalities can be found due in part to the cognitive demands of low level writing skills. Indeed, it has been observed that written texts produced by children are shorter and of lower quality than oral ones (Berninger, et al., 1992; Berninger &amp; Swanson,1994). However, how the transcription skills might constrain the syntactic complexity of children's written texts is not well established. The children (N=163) that participated in this study were attending three different schools located in Córdoba Province, Argentina. The children were examined at the end of the 1st and 2nd year of primary education. The oral and written retellings were analyzed using Length, T- unit number and Syntactic Complexity Index (SCI) (Hunt, 1965; 1970). The analysis o ff children's productions showed differences between grades and modalities. The differences between modalities were found in text Length and T-unit, but not in SCI. These results suggest that transcription skills do not affect syntactic performance. Nevertheless, a more detailed analysis revealed differences between groups. Possible restrictions of the original text on children's performance were also observed. The implications and the scope of the SCI and units used for the analysis are furthered discussed.","Developmental writing processes; Oral and written style differences; Syntactic maturity",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014908733

After a review of publications made by the Physics Education Research group (PER), the importance of a structured, systemic methodology to solve physics problems is considered. Then a structured, systemic methodology for solving physics problems is described by extending the well-known problem-solving steps presented by Polya. The proposed strategy includes the following steps: 1. Understand the problem, 2. Provide a qualitative description of the problem, 3. Plan a solution, 4. Carry out the plan, 5. Verify the internal consistency and coherence of the equations used, and 6. Check and evaluate the obtained solution.

A 13-item single response multiple choice test has been constructed and used to measure the conceptual knowledge of physics topics normally included in high school physics. It also contains 5 items on mathematics subjects thought to be of relevance for physics instruction. The results show that these student's sample still hold, after high school instruction, major misconceptions of the tested topics. A comparison is made between this measured understanding and the conceptual knowledge adquired by high school estudiantes enrolled in classes that followed active learning methods. The significant differences in learning gains between traditional and active learning instruction strongly indicate that traditional approaches to teaching physics in high schools should be replaced by field-tested, active learning methodologies. It is argue that this study can be considered, in the field of physics, complementary and reaffirmatory of the recently released results of the PISA 2006 survey.","Active learning; Conceptual knowledge; Evaluation; High school physics; Physics misconceptions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84455190979

Chemometrics analysis on 2003 and 2007 chemistry teacher cadastral database supplied by the Goiás State Department of Education revealed a change in high school chemistry teachers forward to PIII level (stable job; graduated; teaching degree). In2003, nine out of all thirty seven regional offices of education in the state had more than 50 % of its chemistry teachers having academic degree (PIII and PA-D levels). In 2007 all thirty eight regional offices achieved this figure. In 2003 no regional office had teachers having a master degree and in 2007 this number raised to thirty regional offices.

Study participants were 56 children and adolescents aged between 7 and 14 years; two instruments were used: forms of identification of children and Engel's seizure classification. Obtained data were analyzed, using the Minitab Software - Version 12.1, by means of the Student t, Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests and logistic regression. The results indicate that children from special schools presented cases that were more sever, with greater seizure frequency, earlier epilepsy onset, and longer episodes of epilepsy; they also used a greater number of anticonvulsants. The conclusion indicated that organic epilepsy variables can affect the schooling process for children with epilepsy. However, further studies are needed to investigate difficulties that might interfere with academic performance and that may affect learning in children with epilepsy.","Adolescence; Childhood; Epilepsy; Schooling; Special eeducation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049371684

To support research on prediction in the context of mathematics education, we present three perspectives on prediction: (1) prediction as a mental act highlights the cognitive aspect and the conceptual basis of one's prediction, (2) prediction as a mathematical activity highlights the spectrum of prediction tasks that are common in mathematics curricula and (3) prediction as a socio-epistemological practice highlights the construction of mathematical knowledge in classrooms. Each perspective supports the claim that prediction when used effectively can foster mathematical learning.

In response, the INEE used the National Standards Tests for Mathematics and Reading Comprehension, applied by the Department of Evaluation of the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 2000, and again in 2005. The results showed that sixth graders in private, public, rural schools had made a significant advance in mathematics and reading comprehension. Indigenous Education had also advanced considerably in the latter subject. Among junior high schools, only those of the general category showed significant improvement on both tests. Regarding gender, women scored higher than men in reading comprehension, as contrasted with math. In terms of age, it was found that students of an age normal for their scholastic level performed better than those older.

The situation becomes much more alarming as the literature about it points out the difficulty of diagnosing and intervening in this type of disorder due to a lack of clarity about what its clinical symptoms are and the non-existence of consistent studies about the future consequences of the use of stimulants in children. To discuss these issues, the first part of the article presents the hegemonic concept of the disorder and its understanding of the child's psyche. The second one deals with the way in which historical and cultural psychology analyses the development of attention and the voluntary control of human behavior, by given a new dimension to the understanding of the disorder. Finally, some reflections are offered about the teaching-learning process in children with partial development of superior psychological functions, as well as and the role of psychology and teaching in understanding this phenomenon so that they can provide support for the practical measures to be adopted with regard to the problem.","Attention deficit; Hiperactivity; Learning; Teaching; Vygotsky",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955587657

On the other hand, the strong diversity in the uses of university degrees also results in the large number of people holding an occupation with lower income to that of the occupational category corresponding to that degree. The field of knowledge has little relevance in this case, contrary to the possibilities of using such a title in a position of power or below that respective professional category.","University title and professional market; University title and ruling groups; University title and social position",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955390657

The analysis of the students' academic achievement in a higher education institution together with the different factors that affect the student's performance generates answers to the questions that the people involved in the teaching process commonly ask themselves. This analysis is therefore, an excellent way to find and propose solutions in order to improve the student's performance. Subjects and methods. The association between the students' academic performance and the academic and demographic factors was determined in the first level of Biochemistry. Two methodologies were used for this purpose. The first one, a numerical analysis based on the partial and final grades, and a second categorical method based on the final success (≥ 3.0) or failure (< 3.0) on the subject. Results. A positive and statistically significant correlation was found when the academic performance in Biochemistry, the general and specific results of the state test (natural sciences and mathematics), the institutional scholarship status and entering the Medicine program without pre-university courses was analyzed. Factors, such as coming from different schools and the city of origin, do not affect significantly the performance in any of the analyses. Conclusions. Academic performance in Biochemistry is directly affected by factors involving the individual student's skills while the demographical factors are not involved. © Viguera Editores SL 2010.","Academic performance; Active learning; Intellectual competence; Learning influential factors; Teaching process",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955145226

METHODS: A cross-sectional and prospective study was applied in 58 graduate students of Medicine Bachelor's degree. The clinical aptitude was defined operationally as the measurement is obtained by applying an instrument to explore this part of clinical competence, based on real clinical cases. Tool validation was made by professor of the same Medicine school where the definitive version remained in 320 reactives. Six indicators were explored: identification of risk factors, recognition of clinical data, diagnostic integration, use and interpretation of laboratory studies, therapeutical decisions and follow-up measures. For the results analysis we used the descriptive statistics and to obtain the relation among the quantitative variables we performed the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Also, we estimated the random expected qualification. RESULTS: The internal consistency of measurement tool used was of 0,82. Final average correlation of the career and the clinical aptitude level achieved by the newly graduate students of Medicine Bachelor's degree was of 0,42 (p < 0,01). CONCLUSIONS: Although the development level of the clinical aptitude isn't the desirable one, there is come level of correlation between final average of the career and the clinical aptitude at the end of eighth semester.","Clinical aptitude; Correlation; Medicine graduate",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955136690

The State Audit Office, for example, has only taken into account the 25% minimum percentage of taxes (as provided in the Brazilian Federal Constitution) and never mentioned extra revenue to this minimum, such as payroll-linked contribution, federal transfers for programmes such as school meals or credit operations linked to education. In addition, the reports contain inconsistent data and confuse two different concepts, that of expenditure on the budgetary notion of education with the concept of maintenance and development of education. The Audit Office of the Municipalities has also made a number of mistakes in its resolutions. It employed the term 'basic education' (a much broader term) instead of 'education for children prior to 6 years old' and confused expenses on education (a broader term) with expenses on Fundef (a more restricted category, as it refers to part of the expenses on education).

Instruction in dermatology is often under-valued, in spite of the frequency of dermatological complaints in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the skill of doctors who are not dermatologists as well as the students of the Medical School at the Campinas State University, Brazil, in the treatment of patients with dermatological lesions. Among the students, there are 24 participating in a new model of curriculum, which came as a result of a revision of teaching methods, which allows a greater number of activities relating to this specialty. Subjects and methods. This study was designed by using a writing test which contains ten clinical cases and the images relating to these cases. The person being evaluated was required to choose one of five alternatives for each question. This instrument was applied anonymously to 83 doctors and 55 medical students. In this group of doctors, eight were specialists in dermatology and served as a point of reference for the study. Results. Students of the new curriculum had an average of 6.34 considering the note of dermatologists as ten, the maximum score possible. The average of the other students was 3.82 and the average of the non-specialist doctors attending in primary care units was 3.32. Conclusions. The research demonstrated that the change in teaching of dermatology was a relevant factor for the acquisition of knowledge in this area in the new curriculum at the university. It also supported what had been previously supposed, that non-specialists in the Family Health Program who attend patients at health primary care in the regions evaluated did not receive adequate training for the performance of this specialty as expected to general practitioners. © Viguera Editores SL 2010.","Assessment; Curriculum; Dermatology; Education; Medical care; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954053964

Complexity science is particularly relevant as medical education embraces a movement towards more authentic curricula focusing on integration, interactive small-group learning, and early and sustained clinical and community experiences. Discussion A medical school as a whole, and the expression of its curriculum through the interactions, exchanges and learning that take place within and outside of it, is a complex system. Complexity science, a derivative of the natural sciences, is the study of the dynamics, conditions and consequences of interactions. It addresses the nature of the conditions favourable to change and transformation (learning). Conclusions The core process of complexity, self-organisation, requires a system that is open and far from equilibrium, with ill-defined boundaries and a large number of non-linear interactions involving short-loop feedback. In such a system, knowledge does not exist objectively 'out there'; rather, it exists as a result of the exchange between participants, an action that becomes knowing. Understanding is placed between participants rather than being contained in one or the other. Knowledge is not constructed separately in the mind of the knower, but, rather, it emerges; it is co-created during the exchange in an authentic recursive transactive process. Learning and knowing become adaptive responses to continuously evolving circumstances. An approach to curriculum based on self-organisation is characterised as rich, recursive, relational and rigorous and it illuminates how a curriculum can be understood as a complex adaptive system. The perspective of complexity applied to medical education broadens and enriches research questions relevant to health professions education. It focuses our attention onto how we are together as human beings. How we respond to and frame the issues of learning and understanding that challenge contemporary medicine and, by extension, medical education, in a complex and rapidly changing world can have profound effects on the preparedness of tomorrow's health professionals and their impact on society. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Curriculum; Education, Medical; Group Processes; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Educational; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74049118060

We address this problem through an interpretative analysis of a whole-group conversation about alternative ways of solving a problem involving percent discounts that occurred in a sixth grade classroom. This research study draws upon Dewey's theory of inquiry, Vygotsky's cultural-historical psychology, Freudenthal's realistic mathematics education, and Halliday's systemic functional linguistics (SFL). From Freudenthal, we borrow the notions of mathematizing and guided reinvention-the former notion offers a view of mathematics as an activity of structuring subject matter and the latter one provides insights into the processes whereby mathematizing is learned and taught in the classroom. We glean from Dewey his view of reflective thinking as inquiry and the role that conversations may serve therein. We rely upon Vygotsky's notions of a verbal thinking plane and a social phase of learning in order to reconsider the function of whole-class interaction in apprenticing students into mathematizing. Finally, SFL provides us with tools for explaining the choices of grammar and vocabulary students and teachers make as they realize meanings in whole-group conversations. Treating the selected whole-class conversation as a text, we focus our analysis on how this text came to mean what it did. Our central questions are as follows: What meanings were realized in the whole-class conversation by teacher and students and how were these meanings realized? How did the teacher's lexico-grammatical choices guide the students' choices? In addressing these questions, we advance an interpretation of the conversation as paradigmatic of students and teacher thinking aloud together about percents. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Bar model; Functional grammar; Mathematizing; Percents; Reflective thinking; Semiotic mediation; Whole-class interaction",,"City University of New York","Acknowledgment We wish to thank Norma Presmeg as well as the three anonymous reviewers for their very helpful editorial comments and suggestions.

Methods: A questionnaire of self-assessment was distributed to 104 European and 24 Mexican urologists-in-training. We assessed the perception of residents about their level of training and factors associated with self-perceived performance. Results: Mean age of 128 residents was 32.69 ± 3.33 years. Mexican residents spent significantly more time in urological departments than European residents. The weekly amount of hours spent at work was higher in Europe; while the number of residents per hospital was higher in Mexico. Mexican residents reported more reliable support from a supervising senior. European residents perceived they had a superior level regarding transplantation in female urology and urinary lithiasis, whereas Mexican residents felt more confident regarding urological infections and paediatric urology. Factors associated with better self-perceived performance were the number of months in urology, the number of non-urologic rotations and a supervising senior. Conclusion: Mexican residents in urology perceive that their own level of training is similar to that of European residents. The number of months of training in urology, the number of non-urologic rotations and a supporting senior are associated with a better self-perceived performance. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.",,"adult; article; controlled study; female; hospital; human; job performance; male; Mexico; perception; questionnaire; residency education; resident; self report; stone formation; urology; Western Europe; working time; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Europe; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Mexico; Questionnaires; Students, Medical; Urology",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71149105081

To this end it analyzes, principally, two sources of information: first, data from the U.S. Census Bureau's ongoing survey of households, the American Community Survey. This data identifies the features of the sociodemographic and educational profile of Mexicans residing in the United States of America, and compares it with the data for the native population and for the subset of foreign, non-Mexican residents in that country. Work with survey microdata makes it possible to provide accurate figures for population volume in various relevant categories: schooling, occupation and income. By observing these data we attempt to learn the conditions of the most highly-educated group within the contingent of Mexican migrants. The second source of information, which permits a view from a complementary angle, is derived from the statistics contained in temporary-resident visas obtained by Mexicans. This part of the text studies the particular action of three types of visas: H1B work permits for highly qualified personnel; TN visas, granted to professionals within the framework of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and finally, the F and J visas, issued to students and scholars. Using the results of both approaches, we review the scale and significance of the migration of highly-skilled human resources from Mexico to the United States.","Academic achievement; Brain drain; Human resources; Immigrants; Immigration; Income; Labor",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891720344

It postulates the existence of certain characteristics of schools which have a personal and significant effect on the scholastic achievement of their students. In particular, the work falls into the category of studies on school effects. The effect of the school is defined as the proportionof the variance of the scholastic achievement results attributable to school policies and practices. The purpose of the study is to estimate the magnitude of the school's effect, i.e. the relative contribution of the school in the total variation of academic achievement in Spanish and Mathematics in the three grades of the Mexican junior high school. The data employed come from the National Standard Tests for 2002 and 2003, applied to a national sample of junior high schools in Mexico. The analysis was performed with the HLM program, using Multilevel Models. The work was done with a model of two levels (student and school). The research, which is descriptive and correlational, contributes explanatory elements based on the analyses made. The key findings are these: a) The estimated effect of the school through the intraclass correlation index (ICI) was 12% for Spanish and 9% for Mathematics, which means that the Mexican junior high schools are quite similar to each other. Although it may seem paradoxical, we have confirmed that this effect, numerically speaking, issufficient for us to say that the school which students attend makes the difference. b) In comparing scholastic effects between the junior high schools' modalities of operation, it was found that in the case of Mathematics, the telesecundarias (junior high schools conducted by Internet) have a greater effect on student performance than do general and technical public schools, or private schools, in both Spanish and Mathematics.","Language Instruction; Mathematics instruction; School effectiveness; Secondary education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891667257

It became much easier for students who were not fond of algebraic representations to work with concepts such as function using graphs or tables. Research on how students use such software showed that they shaped the tools to their own needs, resulting in an intershaping relationship in which tools shape the way students know at the same time the students shape the tools and influence the design of the next generation of tools. This kind of research led to the theoretical perspective presented in this paper: knowledge is constructed by collectives of humans-with-media. In this paper, I will discuss how media have shaped the notions of problem and knowledge, and a parallel will be developed between the way that software has brought new possibilities to mathematics education and the changes that the Internet may bring to mathematics education. This paper is, therefore, a discussion about the future of mathematics education.

Baldwin introduced a powerful view regarding Darwinian Evolution. Baldwin suggested that behavioral flexibility could play a role in amplifying natural selection because this ability enables individuals to modify the environment of natural selection affecting the fate of future generations. In this view, behavior can affect evolution but, and this is crucial, without claiming that responses to environmental demands acquired during one's lifetime could be passed directly to one's offspring. In the present paper, we want to use this view as a guiding metaphor to cast light on understanding how students and teachers can utilize the environment of digital technologies to scaffold their activities.

Aim: To integrate basic Bacteriology with mechanisms of action of antimicrobial agents. Methods: The board has 121 squares, including squares with question marks and antimicrobial agents. Each student receives a card with a clinical case, identification of the bacterium and its resistance to antimicrobials. The student rolls a dice and moves the corresponding number of squares. The game depends on the dice values rolled, the bacterial resistance profile, and the questions the student has to answer each time he/she lands on a question mark. Previously, the students were given a lecture about the subject. On the day of the game, students answered a pre-test and a post-test. The paired t-test was used for the statistical analysis. Results: The game was applied to 78 students of the Medicine and Pharmacy undergraduate courses of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. There was an increase in the number of right answers and a decrease in the number of unknown answers. There were no significant differences between the courses. Conclusion: The game could be applied to other undergraduate courses in the field of Health Sciences. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; article; bacteriology; bacterium; Brazil; curriculum; drug effect; education; human; learning; medical education; medical student; pharmacy student; questionnaire; recreation; teaching; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Brazil; Curriculum; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Play and Playthings; Questionnaires; Students, Medical; Students, Pharmacy; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Short Survey,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951986906

In this paper, we argue that the very nature of dynamic mathematical representations-being intrinsically temporal, occurring over time-offer very different opportunities for narrative thinking than do the static diagrams and pictures traditionally available to learners.

The Theory of Reasoned Action and discriminant analysis are used to explore relations of a number of variables and the complex field of factors influencing Viennese high school students' shopping behavior when shopping for organic products. Key findings include the importance of primary socialization in forming social norms and shaping behavior.

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarquical Cluster Analysis (HCA) methods are used to select the most appropriate method and basis set to model molecules. Maps of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are used to correlate structure-activity. Also the docking is employed to investigate the interaction between artemisinin and heme.

The revision of diverse articles on teaching alternatives suggests tendencies in the way changes are proposed; some only affect the teaching method, others consider the content to be taught. We observe that resorting to the history of the genesis of knowledge has permitted the identification of a variable in the mathematical content of the curriculum which influences the acquisition of the notions and procedures of calculus. At some point, the what to teach becomes part of how to teach and from there mathematics activity takes on a didactic sense in the classroom.

A main policy challenge at present is related to the unequal distribution of vital resources, including technology. In the educational context, many changes have been observed, such as a decrease in analphabetism and an increase in the number of physicians, lawyers, and scientists. In this paper we will describe the educational experience involving the use of information technology, especially computers, at Brazilian primary and secondary schools. We live in a technological era in which it is important to educate our children to be aware of the impact of technology on society and the environment in general, as well as how to personally deal with them. From home to workplace, digital technological tools have become a part of day-to-day life. Digital technology has become essential in everyday life, and demands have been placed on schools to educate students so as to make them ""technologically literate"". Millions of Reals (R$) have been invested by the Brazilian government to equip schools with computers and communication tools, but low technological literacy remains a serious challenge. To address this problem, it is crucial to elucidate the real advantages and disadvantages of the use of computers in the educational system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It also allows the use of the item tri response theory in order to obtain a proficiency scale in ENEM's compositions. The adoption of this methodology allows to describe the candidates skills and abilities in the different levels of the scale, making possible to define the points in which the categories of response skills are dominated. The use of this methodology may improve the presentation of ENEM's results and it may also be useful for further studies of the compositions results.

We have not found any papers on formal thought in Argentine university students, in spite of the obvious shortcomings observed in the classrooms. Thus, the main objective of this paper was exploring the relation between formal operational thought level and academic performance in the 1st year of the engineering course. Method: The study was carried out on a sample of 709 first year engineering students from two cohorts of students attending one of four engineering courses during 2006 and 2007 at an Argentine university. Assessment was taken using Tobin and Capie's (1981) Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT). Data about demographic characteristics and achievement test scores was also collected. Results: Significant relations were observed between formal thought level and student marks in entrance exams, in the partial algebra, calculus, physics and chemistry exams and in the final chemistry exam. Conclusion: This research may be useful as a guide for diagnosis and intervention design, since they point to probabilistic and correlational reasoning as the most difficult skills to develop. As the results tend to converge with those of research carried out in other countries, it seems also that the TOLT may be useful in transcultural exploration. © Education &amp; Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (Spain).","Academic achievement; Engineering education; Logical thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951966869

After correction and grouping, four question solution categories were identified. For each category an inference was made of the question formulation that students seem to have understood and solved based on the interpretation they made of the question proposed. In broad terms, results were that: a) strategies employed by students to solve the questions did not vary significantly between the two grades analyzed; b) the performance of students of the 3rd grade of secondary education was better than that of students from the 8th grade of fundamental education; c) most students solved the question using arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, which is being considered here as an arithmetic strategy. The analysis also indicated that poor student performance is more closely related to difficulties in understanding the formulation of the question, and that students ""master"" part of the ""mathematical content"" necessary for its solution.","Learning assessment in school mathematics; Mathematical education; Right and wrong answers in mathematics; Written production",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950958052

The present article analyzes the relationship between this process and the most expressive segment within the demographic structure of the province at that time, namely, the population of free blacks. In order to conduct this analysis, we have sought reference in a census documentation that attempted to cover the whole population of Minas Gerais districts, making a record of children attending school. Based on these numbers, we built a racial profile of schools, comparing it with information gathered from other documents (teachers' lists, travelers' accounts, memoirs), which pointed to a majority of blacks in elementary schools. The interpretation we give to the presence of blacks in schools of Minas Gerais indicates that this institution was one of the elements utilized by that group to establish their position inside the social sphere. In this respect, the text highlights the fact that schooling acquired specific meanings among the black population; more specifically, it represented their insertion into the literate culture, and a way of signaling their distancing from the world of slavery, and was also a demonstration of their mastery of the codes of conduct of free people.","19th century; Blacks; History of education; Minas gerais",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77950950710

Research in Mathematics Education looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of ""changing the sign"" when ""moving"" the member. To minimize this problem, a balance can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2) determine how substituting the conventional balance with a computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity, negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First, because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue, cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for solving 1st degree equations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Medical programmes that implement problem-based learning (PBL) face several challenges when introducing this innovative learning method. PBL relies on small group as the foundation of study, and tutors facilitate learning by guiding the process rather than teaching the group. One of the major challenges is the use of strategies to assess students working in small groups. Self-, peer- and tutor-assessment are integral part of PBL tutorials and they're not easy to perform, especially for non experienced students and tutors. The undergraduate PBL medical programme was introduced in 2003, and after two years the curriculum committee decided to evaluate the tutorial assessment in the new program. Methods. A random group of ten students, out of a cohort of sixty, and ten tutors (out of eighteen) were selected for semi-structured interviews. The social representations' theory was used to explore how the students and tutors made sense of ""assessment in tutorials"". The data were content analyzed using software for qualitative and quantitative processing of text according to lexicological distribution patterns. Results. Even though students and tutors are aware of the broader purpose of assessment, they felt that they were not enough trained and confident to the tutorial assessment. Assigning numbers to complex behaviors on a regular basis, as in tutorials, is counter productive to cooperative group learning and self assessment. Tutors believe that students are immature and not able to assess themselves and tutors. Students believe that good grades are closely related to good oral presentation skills and also showed a corporative attitude among themselves (protecting each other from poor grades). Conclusion. Faculty training on PBL tutorials' assessment process and a systematic strategy to evaluate new programs is absolutely necessary to review and correct directions. It is envisaged that planners can make better-informed decisions about curricular implementation, review and reform when information of this nature is made available to them. © 2009 Bollela et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; conceptual framework; medical education; medical student; problem based learning; self evaluation; semi structured interview; student attitude; teacher; adolescent; adult; computer program; curriculum; education; educational model; educational status; female; human; male; medical student; methodology; perception; qualitative research; teaching; Adolescent; Adult; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Educational; Problem-Based Learning; Qualitative Research; Self Assessment (Psychology); Social Perception; Software; Students, Medical; Teaching; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149142470

Following other authors, we choose the Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a convenient illustration of the concepts. The material is organized as a ""learning object"", the central element of which is an interactive and commented animation. Auxiliary texts present the underlying mathematical formalism as well as information of historical, epistemological and experimental nature. Three levels of description are considered successively in the animation. The first shows the beam in the approximation of geometric optics, while the second analyzes the purely ondulatory aspects. The third level presents the quantum-corpuscular view, introducing wave packets associated with individual photons and displaying the relation between counting and wave function. Inserting a detector in one arm of the instrument allows the discussion of the classical issue of the path followed by the photon. The animation presents visualizations of the ingredients which underlie theoretical descriptions, such as wave fronts, phase shifts, superpositions, and separations of wave packets into components. Taking literally the most usual interpretation of quantum mechanics, we exhibit on the computer screen the ""state collapse"" induced by observation. We believe that such theoretic-conceptual visualizations usefully complement a realistic simulation of the experimental device developed by other authors.

Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper selecting targeted scholarly works that provide support for the proposed model. Findings The paper presents a model of intrapreneurial learning and performance in which the constructs of environment, individual learning, intrapreneurship, and organizational learning influence organizational performance. Intrapreneurship is a relatively recent area of exploration in which scholarly efforts have primarily focused on identifying the construct and distinguishing it from entrepreneurship. The proposed model of intrapreneurial learning and performance joins a growing number of works that explore how intrapreneurship contributes to organizational performance. It is suggested that the framework may help scholars identify potential strategies of learning that could help organizations position intrapreneurship as a vehicle for improving organizational performance. Originality/value The paper postulates an original relationship among individual learning, intrapreneurship, organizational learning, environment, and organizational performance. In this framework, individual and organizational learning combine to offer a unique perspective on the link between intrapreneurship and organizational performance. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Individual development; Organizational performance; Workplace training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68549097889

Representations play an essential role in mathematical thinking. They favor the understanding of mathematical concepts and stimulate the development of flexible and versatile thinking in problem solving. Here our focus is on their use in optimization problems, a type of problem considered important in mathematics teaching and learning in higher education. Method. By using an observational methodology, we present the representation patterns used by three students in their fifth year of an undergraduate mathematics degree at the University of Granada (Spain). The patterns were obtained through protocol analysis in which students' written production was complemented with their spoken thinking protocols. The instrument used was prepared intentionally for this study and was composed of three optimization problems. Students solved the instrument individually in an isolated environment while being video-recorded. Results. We designed a framework for protocol analysis and used it to analyze the transcriptions of students' productions. Results are presented in the form of a microscopic analysis of the particular cases, with detailed records of the representations used by the students, translation between records and the time used in these actions. These elements are then used to define a profile of each Problem Solver, which was found to be different for the three cases. Discussion and conclusions. The framework designed for the microscopic analysis of problem solving protocols was useful for describing the representations and the translations between them during the problem-solving process. The segmentation and coding process made evident the need to include episodes which initially were not identified as representations. A characterization of the Problem Solvers shows a strong connection between students' success in solving optimization problems and their skill in using representations. © Education & Psychology I+D+i.","Case studies; Optimization problems; Problem solving; Representations",,,"1 This paper was prepared as part of Project SEJ2006-09056 , ""Representations, new technologies, and construíting meanings in Mathematics Education'', financed by the National R&D&I Plan of the Ministry of Science & Education, and co-sponsored by FEDER of the European Community.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043484832

Considering the time constraints and the need to stress the interpretative rather than the computational skills, the authors have developed the software package UATSA (University of Arizona Time Series Analysis) that incorporates many analytical tools commonly used in time series analysis in an organized and sequential manner: exploratory statistics, markovian processes, univariate and multivariate analyses (ARMA models), frequency decomposition algorithms, principal components, canonical correlations and cluster analyses are included within the current version of the package.

A series of decompositions by student ethnicity and type of school shed some additional light on important questions in the Guatemalan context, and beyond. The large indigenous test score gap is not explained by differences in an extensive list of observable features of schools. The large effect for community characteristics suggests peer group effects or more general institutional differences related to services or labor markets.

However, limited research has been conducted with minority children and adolescents. In the present study, the construct validity of the Spanish-language version of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI-S) ages 8-12 years (N = 100). The CDI was developed by Maria Kovacs (1992) and has been a widely used instrument for screening depression in children. Fifty of the children had witnessed domestic violence (secondary victims of domestic violence) and received psychological services for victims of domestic violence, and fifty had not witnessed domestic violence. To identify the group of non-victims of domestic violence, their mothers completed the Conflict Tactic Scale (CIS). The CDI is a self-report instrument used to measure symptoms of depression. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed including the 27 items that make up the instrument, using principal component analysis as the extraction method and Varimax rotations. This analysis revealed that the CDI measures five dimensions of depression in the child. However, differences were found in the factor structure of the Spanish CDI when compared with the original version. Additionally, its internal consistency was documented.",,"adaptive behavior; article; child; comparative study; cultural factor; depression; domestic violence; female; Hispanic; human; language; male; personality test; psychological aspect; psychometry; Puerto Rico; reproducibility; statistics; Adaptation, Psychological; Child; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Depressive Disorder; Domestic Violence; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Language; Male; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Puerto Rico; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63749118191

Three different configurations were suggested for placing such warmer samples so that students were asked to order them with respect to their chilling capability, that is, to their ability to chill samples as fast as possible. Freshmen's written answers were collected before CFD was used to simulate and visualize each distinct chilling scenario. Accordingly, a finite-volume FORTRAN simulator for transport phenomena in domains fully or partially filled up with porous matrix was used to help compare each chilling performance. Among all possible combinations, answer distribution is presented and discussed in the light of freshmen's scholar background as well as based on the way natural convection concepts were introduced. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computational fluid dynamics; Food engineering education; Foodstuff chilling; Mathematical modeling; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Electric field effects; Engineering education; Fluid dynamics; Natural convection; Students; Basic concepts; Cfd-simulations; Field visualizations; Finite volumes; Food engineering education; Food engineerings; Food industries; Foodstuff chilling; Fortrans; Mathematical modeling; Numerical simulation; Porous matrixes; Porous samples; Process Modeling; Room temperatures; Transport phenomenon; Computational fluid dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449145542

The databases consulted are those provided by the Brazilian Federal Council of Dentistry, Brazilian Ministry of Health, Brazilian Ministry of Education, National Institute of Studies and Educational Research Anísio Teixeira, and Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Formal dental education in Brazil started in the late nineteenth century with the creation of courses annexed to existing schools of medicine in Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. Today, there are 191 institutions of higher education nationwide granting degrees in dentistry (137 private [71.7 percent] and fifty-four public [28.3 percent]), with a total of 17,157 student positions offered annually. These schools graduate around 10,000 professionals per year - one of the highest rates in the world. Both the distribution of schools of dentistry and of dentists varies among the regions of the country, with the greatest concentrations in major metropolitan centers with high population density, resulting in limited coverage in the more deprived regions. A review of epidemiological data for oral health and distribution of dentists in Brazil indicates that there is a lack of systematic planning for the allocation of the dental workforce and a lack of consideration of regional needs in the development of dental training programs in Brazil today.","Brazil; Dental education; Dentist; Labor market; Schools of dentistry","article; Brazil; dental education; dental student; dentist; history; history of medicine; human; statistics; Brazil; Dentists; Education, Dental; History of Dentistry; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Schools, Dental; Students, Dental",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63349085274

In this paper, the Central American universities are viewed as important subsystems of the respective national systems of innovation. It discusses research capacity enhancement through collaborative research between Denmark and Central America. To what extent did the knowledge transfer and sharing, as well as the organisational capacity building efforts, succeed? Our overall conclusion is that the research capacity that exists in the North has to be carefully adapted to the specific context in places where it is expected to be useful.

There are, also, typical learning physical problems that can not be completely explained and even understood using the blackboard, because they present a kind of complex behaviors such as non linearties or many degrees of freedom. That is why they do not have any analytical solution. In any case Computational Physics method is an alternative teaching tool what in practice contains all of the topics of basic programming and numerical methods. In this paper we aboard some issues, enable us, to conform what we will call ""algorithmic education"". We present some traditional physics education problems, based on numerical and visual algorithms, for a better conceptual understanding and models build up by the students it self. Just by using some elementary programming modules, we propose a strategy to build up models starting from a pre-differential conceptual interpretation, which can be particularly useful in the firs period of university. The contribution consists in by using a few mathematical elements and resources, students can make more and more complex simulation models. Specificall , for the implementation of the ""algorithmic education"" we have used python, a programming language what permits the develop of themes covering from the free particle movement, and damped harmonic oscillators, as well as the ideal or hard spheres gases and even Brownian motion walks.

For this purpose the solution to the problem is interpreted in terms of diffusion waves, a peculiar class of waves with complex wave numbers whose generation, propagation and detection constitute the basis of modern analytical techniques able to measure optical and transport properties of materials in the condensed or gaseous phase. A generalized mathematical equation describing this kind of waves is shown and the existence of critical modulation frequencies, at which the diffusive fluxes change their behaviour, is demonstrated for different physical phenomena involving diffusion waves.

Then, it continued with the observation and analysis of teaching-learning processes developed for arithmetics in elementary schools in the Metropolitan Region and ended with the analysis of the institutional restrictions imposed by schools for the development of those processes. We identified the phenomenon of the progressive inhibition of some mathematical abilities of students through elementary school.

Web-based communities form as individuals get together to discuss and exchange information. These communities provide a nexus around which individuals organise and learn. As they grow and accumulate shared resources, they become rich information sources. The usual way to navigate the web is to search, starting from a search page and then browsing to look for adequate resources. However, when looking for information, individuals often turn to others for recommendations or answers. This paper presents a peer-to-peer tool to assist in web navigation and searches by leveraging a community's existing knowledge. Individuals rate websites and share these ratings with the community. Recommendations are made based on these ratings. This enables a community-geared rating, where individuals know they will find ratings that reflect the opinions of the community in which he or she is inserted. This mimics recommendation-seeking behaviour and has the potential to lead to better results as searches become more directed towards a community's context.

This dissertation intended to answer three questions: a) what the student per year cost of public school in the basic education in Teresina city in 2006 is; b) what is the category or what are the categories of items which present a higher participation in the composition of direct cost of the municipal schools and what factors intervene in this cost?, and finally, c) what is the participation of Fundef in the composition of the student per year cost in the public education of Teresina city in 2006? In order to examine deeply the result of the last question, it was intended to disaggregate the expense per each student undertaken by the municipality of Teresina in 17 municipal public schools,intentionally chosen and giving special attention to some features, in order to identify Fundef's participation in relation to the school expenses in the different stages of the Basic education in each zone covered by it (rural and urban).

A questionnaire was constructed, containing: questions involving socio-demographic variables; items of the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale, with the goal of examining the youngster's exposure to interparental violence; and items of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales, concerning physical and psychological abuse committed by parents against children. Bullying and victimization were measured by 26 items developed specially for the study's purpose, based on a modified version of Olweus' questionnaire. Associations were found between bullying and domestic violence, but these associations were different according to gender. Being exposed to domestic violence was associated with being a bully/victim in school (especially for girls), but not with being a victim of bullying. On the other hand, parental violence increased the probability of boys reporting being implied in bullying as victims or as bully/victims. In terms of the girls, suffering parental violence was only associated as being a bully/victim.","Bullying; Family relationship; Schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953695971

Specifically, the study assessed the impact of the programme on the ecological knowledge of 72 students. Qualitative feedback suggests that students learnt about forestry, acquired greater awareness of the importance of conservation for the local environment and enjoyed the participatory teaching methods used in the programme. Quantitative results show a positive and significant association between the number of times a student participated in the programme and the student’s ecological knowledge. Students who participated in the programme once had a 16.3% higher knowledge on ecological concepts and knew, on average, 1.5 more local forest plants than students who never attended it (p<.001). Findings suggest that the inclusion of participatory environmental education programmes in preparatory schools would improve the acquisition of ecological knowledge.

During specialty studies, the resident doctor faces higher stress levels than the normal population, affecting him/her professionally and personally, hence we ask the question: do the residency studies modify the quality of life of the resident doctors who are taking the specialty? Subjects and methods. A descriptive, comparative study was carried out in February 2006 and in February 2007. We applied the PECVEC questionnaire central module to two resident's groups: the first one, initiating their medical specialty and one year later; and the second one, residents with more than one year of specialty studies. We included residents from medical and surgical specialties that agreed to participate in this study. All data was captured on SPSS v. 15 for analysis descriptive statistics were used for socio-demographic variables, the Student's t for comparing the quality of life among residents and specialty. The quality of life was classified as 'very good' between 3.1 and 4, 'good' between 2.1 and 3, 'regular' between 1.1 and 2 and 'bad' between 0 and 1. Results. 54 residents were included in the first group, from which only 45 completed the questionnaires at the beginning and one year later. We excluded 9 residents because they didn't complete the second questionnaire. In the second group, we included 62 second and third year residents that had more than a year of specialty studies. We found that after one year of specialty, the 6 evaluation scales showed a decline in the quality of life, falling from a level considered as 'very good' (3.18) to 'good' (2.73) p < 0.001. However, when we compared these results with the second group, this one didn't have a decline in the quality of life; the most affected parameters were: physical function and negative state of mind, with respect to. © Viguera Editores SL 2009.","Anxiety; Burnout; Depression; Medical residency; Quality of life",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149089553

Interviews were conducted with family members of 138 children with CLP, ages between 7 and 12 years, who were hospitalized at the Hospital of Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies (HRAC/USP). The results show that most of the interviewees preferred that some kind of activity be conducted with the children while waiting for surgery, because they were conducive to the expression of positive feelings during this period. According to those interviewed, recreational and expressive activities during preoperative treatment helped the children feel calmer, and they observed improvement in the children's emotional state. Such activities entertain, redirect attention, pacify the children and contribute to the children's development. They are important for recovery from surgery, and they ease the negative effects of hospitalization. Activities carried out in the Play Library are the favorite of the children and family members alike.

The debate regarding education was based on a wide range of subjects. However, two aspects are of particular interest to us: i) the need to provide the country with properly qualified teachers, creating establishments for this purpose, which would provide primary school teachers with a specific, specialised and relatively long training of a pedagogical and practical nature; ii) the attention focused on institutions for the protection of children and young people at risk in the context of the social protection policies of the time, which were based on the concept of social regeneration and on the role of education in the progress and development of the country.

Representations play an essential role in mathematical thinking. They favor the understanding of mathematical concepts and stimulate the development of flexible and versatile thinking in problem solving. Here our focus is on their use in optimization problems, a type of problem considered important in mathematics teaching and learning in higher education. Method. By using an observational methodology, we present the representation patterns used by three students in their fifth year of an undergraduate mathematics degree at the University of Granada (Spain). The patterns were obtained through protocol analysis in which students' written production was complemented with their spoken thinking protocols. The instrument used was prepared intentionally for this study and was composed of three optimization problems. Students solved the instrument individually in an isolated environment while being video-recorded. Results. We designed a framework for protocol analysis and used it to analyze the transcriptions of students' productions. Results are presented in the form of a microscopic analysis of the particular cases, with detailed records of the representations used by the students, translation between records and the time used in these actions. These elements are then used to define a profile of each Problem Solver, which was found to be different for the three cases. Discussion and conclusions. The framework designed for the microscopic analysis of problem solving protocols was useful for describing the representations and the translations between them during the problem-solving process. The segmentation and coding process made evident the need to include episodes which initially were not identified as representations. A characterization of the Problem Solvers shows a strong connection between students' success in solving optimization problems and their skill in using representations. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (Spain).","Case studies; Optimization problems; Problem solving; Representations",,"European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","1 This paper was prepared as part of Project SEJ2006-09056 , ""Representations, new technologies, and construíting meanings in Mathematics Education'', financed by the National R&D&I Plan of the Ministry of Science & Education, and co-sponsored by FEDER of the European Community.",,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69349100398

Drawing from a literature on secondary and professional education that defends a unitary school, the article analyzes data related to the last stage of basic education, particularly in schools of the state system. It argues that the intervention of the Brazilian federal government in the funding of education constitutes a huge obstacle to the implementation of an integrated secondary school, since regardless of any ideological bias or party allegiance on the part of those governing the nation, this stage of education has not been considered as a priority for state funding. The work observes the hegemony of state schools in the offer of secondary education, and the increase in the number of schools in which there is integration between secondary schooling and professional education. Lastly, the text notes that, although FUNDEB represents an initiative that places secondary education as a candidate for state funding, it will not produce enough resources to guarantee the funding of the last stage of basic education, especially in a modality integrated to professional training. It concludes by defending a modification of the role played by the federal government in the funding of secondary education, so as to guarantee that the articulation between technical training and general education can be universalized, and with better quality, throughout state schools. © 2009 Faculdade de Educação da Universidade de São Paulo.","Funding of education; Integrated secondary education; Technical training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-69249199522

We understand that studying children's books is a privileged occasion to unveil the ways through which educational institutions contribute to the adhesion of individuals to the social order. We thus come to the conclusion that the pedagogy of Der Struwwelpeter is intended to subordinate children to urban life and stimulates an early self-regulating attitude.

Brazilian policy on inclusive education and implementation strategies seek to guarantee access, attendance, and quality education for students with special needs in regular school. Although there are many studies about the legal aspects and the implementation for inclusive school policy, there seems to be a gap between theory and what actually happens in local schools. The Federal government focused on 144 cities intending to promote interaction between administration policies and educational practices in local schools. Based on the perceptions of Special Education administrators of the selected São Paulo cities, the aim of this study is to identify those actions that were implemented according to national directives for special education in the regular school system for Primary Education. Six Special Education Departments of these cities participated in the study. Data was collected using questionnaires, with open and closed questions. The results show that in these cities in the state of São Paulo, the administrators are aware of national public policy regulations; provisions also are in place to promote teacher preparation, continuing education courses and support for teachers. There is transportation, accessibility and access to some educational resources necessary for students with special needs in the regular school. However, there is no statistical information about the total population of special need students in each city; the number of students with disabilities enrolled in regular schools is still very small. Besides these limitations, there are few multidisciplinary teams, and scant collaboration of state departments in Special Education initiatives.","Evaluation; Inclusive education; Public policy; Regular school; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650272437

Seven deaf college students, aged 22-39, participated in the research study. Data was collected through successive individual interviews, in person or by internet, using Portuguese language in spoken or written form or through the manual alphabet with the help of an interpreter. Ten in-person interviews were conducted, which were recorded and transcribed, and eleven were done using e-mail and Messenger®. The reports were analyzed under the socio-anthropological reference that understands the deaf as people who are linguistically and culturally different, belonging to minority groups and who, usually, attend standard hearing-oriented schools. The results show that deaf college students face difficulties, impairments, abandonment and rejection in higher education. They are required to take on the responsibility for their own learning, which includes after-class sessions to compensate for low grades. The school is organized according to the interests and needs of hearing students, i.e. there is no shared language for deaf students; there is no Portuguese-LIBRAS (Brazilian Signal Language) interpreter; there is no bicultural context; there is no dialogue at school. In conclusion, deaf people are capable, productive, characterized by solidarity and interested in advancing in their educational processes, despite the barriers they face daily in the university environment.","Deafness; Higher education; Linguistic community; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650233004

Twenty-eight families from the Federal District participated in this study, among whom 14 had gifted children and 14 had non-gifted children. The data was collected through the Parent Success Inventory - PSI, the Test of Creative Thinking - Drawing Production, and a questionnaire about individual and family characteristics of the gifted. Data was analyzed using the t-test, Pearson's correlation and descriptive statistics. Differences were found between the groups with respect to communication, use of time, parental teaching practices and parental satisfaction. Parents of gifted students and non-gifted students evaluated the level of communication and parental satisfaction more positively than their children did. The results also indicated that the parents of gifted students participated more in the academic lives of their children. The majority of gifted students were boys, who occupied a special family position as the eldest or only child. In addition, no relationship was observed between creativity levels of parents and children. Nevertheless, the evidence showed that gifted students obtained higher performance on creativity tests when compared to non-gifted students.

METHODS: the admission via, the results of some of subjects in the first semester, and the results of the cut-off on the tenth week of the Medical Physiology subject were used as predictors. All of them were related to the mark obtained in the final examination of 548 students in the courses 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. Simple descriptive statistics were used and a regression model with optimal scaling up was adjusted for recoding. The values estimated for this model were converted into an ordinal scale for prediction. An analysis of the main components for a better understanding of the structure of the associations among variables was carried out. RESULTS: predictors as a whole are capable to explain 54% of the variability in the final mark of the subject, whereas the regression model with an optimal scaling up with these predictors allows a satisfactory adjustment. The cut-off on the tenth week is the best predictor. CONCLUSIONS: the admission via, the qualifications obtained in the first semester of first year of the medical career, and the cut-off on the tenth week integrated in a prediction model are a satisfactory prediction model of academic performance in the Medical Physiology subject. The cut-off on the tenth week is the best predictor, since it is more specific and closer to the results of the subject.

These include students' goals of a secure and well-paid job, government actions and the state of the economy in the country concerned. We consider several ways in which departments have successfully approached downturns in numbers by their interactions with students by introducing new teaching approaches, using technology and establishing mathematics centres.","Changes in enrolments; Mathematics teaching; Outreach recruitment; Technology mathematics centres; Undergraduate mathematics enrolments",,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","But there are outreach programmes for undergraduate students too.

This supports the theorization of learning as a socio-cultural practice, framed by Vygotsky and developed by other researchers such as Rogoff, Lave and Wenger. However, there is also evidence that working collaboratively may not be a spontaneous response to working in a group, and that teaching learners how to collaborate, and in particular how to work together to negotiate meaning, is a necessary part of the process of learning collaboratively which can enhance outcomes further. A question for the computer supported collaborative learning community then arises as to whether learning to collaborate can be scaffolded through the use of digital tools, and what such tools might look like. This paper reports on the design of a digital system that aims to support the practice of face-to-face collaboration on open-ended tasks. Findings from trials of the system in classrooms in the UK and Chile show that the model is welcomed both by teachers and pupils, and met its objectives of ensuring greater interaction between class members who did not normally work together, and involvement of all individuals in discussion based activities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TIMSS, especially, has demonstrated the central role that the concept of opportunity to learn plays in understanding cross-national differences in achievement Schmidt et al., (Why schools matter: A cross-national comparison of curriculum and learning 2001). The curricular expectations of a nation and the actual content exposure that is delivered to students by teachers were found to be among the most salient features of schooling related to academic performance. The other feature that emerges in these studies is the importance of the teacher. The professional competence of the teacher which includes substantive knowledge regarding formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy is suggested as being significant-not just in understanding cross-national differences but also in other studies as well (Hill et al. in Am Educ Res J 42(2):371-406, 2005). Mathematics Teaching in the 21st Century (MT21) is a small, six-country study that collected data on future lower secondary teachers in their last year of preparation. One of the findings noted in the first report of that study was that the opportunities future teachers experienced as part of their formal education varied across the six countries (Schmidt et al. in The preparation gap: Teacher education for middle school mathematics in six countries, 2007). This variation in opportunity to learn (OTL) existed in course work related to formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy. It appears from these initial results that OTL not only is important in understanding K-12 student learning but it is also likely important in understanding the knowledge base of the teachers who teach them which then has the potential to influence student learning as well. This study using the same MT21 data examines in greater detail the configuration of the educational opportunities future teachers had during their teacher education in some 34 institutions across the six countries. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.","Comparative study of teacher education; Mathematics teacher education; Opportunities to learn; Teacher education curriculum; Teacher preparation",,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0231886","Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. 0231886.

Furthermore, cause-andeffect relations among these objects and objectives with the learning phases, the learner, and the Intelligent Tutorial System (ITS) are accomplished. These cause-and-effect relations were coded into a Bayesian Network (BN), such that it involves the entire GAeLP. Four fundamental phases that have a direct effect in the learner's learning process are considered: Learner's previous knowledge Phase, Learner's Progress Knowledge Phase, Learner's /Teacher's Aims and Goals Phase, and Navigation Preferences and Experiences Phase. The efficacy of the Bayesian networks is proven through the first phase, in which learners of different knowledge area were select. The main results in this work are: causal relations among objects and objectives of personalization, knowledge phases, learner and electronic system. Personalization profiles set and their probabilities in the first phase were obtained to diagnose the type of personalization of the learner.","Bayesian networks; e-Learning; Learning metrics","Bayesian model; Causal relations; Electronic systems; Knowledge areas; Learning metrics; Learning phasis; Learning process; Navigation preference; Personalizations; Tutorial system; Adaptive e-learning; Cause and effects; Electronic systems; Learning metrics; Learning process; Navigation preference; Network-based modeling; Personalizations; Bayesian networks; E-learning; Optimization; Bayesian networks; E-learning; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning systems; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862981345

A 5-point Likert scale, AMMEC, was used to measure attitudes towards mathematics (AM), computer-based mathematics (AMC), and selfconfidence in mathematics (CM). A total of 430 students using technology for mathematics and 109 students not using it were monitored for 3 years. At the beginning of the study, the participants were aged about 13 years. The statistical analyses of the data showed few gender differences in the way students' attitudes and self-confidence changed over the 3 years. Significant gender differences favouring boys were found in attitudes towards mathematics in grades 8 and 9 for the group using technology. For the group using technology, significantly more boys than girls got high scores in attitudes towards computer-based mathematics in grade 7. Significantly, more girls using technology than girls not using it got high scores in grade 8. The use of technology did not have a positive impact on students' self-confidence. Regardless of whether they used computers or not, from grades 7 to 9, there was a decrease in the self-confidence in mathematics of both boys and girls. To enrich these results and detect possible gender differences in the way attitudes were constructed, 12 girls and 13 boys were interviewed at the end of the study. The analysis of the arguments they presented to explain and justify their attitudes towards mathematics, computerbased mathematics, and their self-confidence in working in mathematics provided evidence of important gender differences in the ways in which boys and girls construct their attitude, indicating how their constructions reflect the gender stereotypes within Mexican society. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.",,,"SEP/SEBYN-CONACYT 2003-CO1-22","Acknowledgments This research was partly sponsored by CONA-CYT (Project SEP/SEBYN-CONACYT 2003-CO1-22).

The study takes in the perspective both of the students and teachers. Information was collected through two questionnaires validated by experts. One was completed by 789 students and the other by 42 Professors at the Schools selected. Results show, on the one hand, the complexity of the problem of student performance in the course subjects analyzed, since performance is linked to curricula, administrative, socio-cultural, and didactic aspects; and, on the other hand, the need to promote training and updating programs that would lead to greater ties between subject-oriented degrees and teacher training.

Teacher shortages and inadequate training of existing faculty are a major problem. On-line faculty development and learning is a plausible component of developing medical teachers in the essentials of pedagogy. Methods: An on-line faculty development learning process utilized by Regional Institute Fellows of the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) is described. This faculty development program begins with a face-to-face meeting followed by an 11-month intersession on-line experience, then another face-to-face meeting and a second 11-month intersession on-line experience. During each on-line session, Fellows participate in discussions on topics which they identify based on their learning needs. The on-line program is highly interactive and Fellows and faculty serve as moderators. Discussions have a conversational tone and a semi-structured format which Fellows develop along with the faculty moderator. The participants share their personal and professional experiences and the moderator 'wraps up' with a summary of the learning posted at the end of the month. Faculty facilitate the discussion, sharing appropriate resources and clarifying issues when necessary. Conclusions: More than the content exchanged, the interpersonal learning environment facilitated effective learning, and rejuvenated the learning experiences and network established during the face-to-face sessions. In view of its cost-effectiveness and the flexible choices it offers, focused, moderated, interactive on-line faculty development and learning needs to be considered seriously as a medium offering opportunities to medical educators and other professionals. © Anshu, P Bansal, SG Mennin, WP Burdick, T Singh, 2008.","Distance learning; Faculty development; On-line discussions","article; content validity; cost effectiveness analysis; course content; course evaluation; curriculum development; education program; faculty practice; India; Internet; interpersonal communication; learning environment; learning style; medical education; online system; personal experience; priority journal; professional competence; professional development; program development; reliability; teacher; work experience; curriculum; education; medical education; medical school; methodology; teaching; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Education, Medical, Continuing; Educational Measurement; Faculty, Medical; Fellowships and Scholarships; India",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349165678

The convergence of these trends creates an enormous instructional challenge: an increasing number of children with EBD, with limited mathematics abilities, dealing with ever more complex subjects. This meta-analysis of mathematics interventions for students with EBD examines math performance outcomes as a function of study and sample characteristics, treatment effects of elements of math instruction, maintenance and generalization effects of these math interventions, and levels of mathematics investigated.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests - are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional competencies have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural bottlenecks in the educational and social system.

However, the lack of tools supporting the authoring and automatic checking of exercises for specifics topics (e.g., geometry) drastically reduces advantages in the use of e-learning environments on a larger scale, as usually happens in Brazil. This paper describes an algorithm, and a tool based on it, designed for the authoring and automatic checking of geometry exercises. The algorithm dynamically compares the distances between the geometric objects of the student's solution and the template's solution, provided by the author of the exercise. Each solution is a geometric construction which is considered a function receiving geometric objects (input) and returning other geometric objects (output). Thus, for a given problem, if we know one function (construction) that solves the problem, we can compare it to any other function to check whether they are equivalent or not. Two functions are equivalent if, and only if, they have the same output when the same input is applied. If the student's solution is equivalent to the template's solution, then we consider the student's solution as a correct solution. Our software utility provides both authoring and checking tools to work directly on the Internet, together with learning management systems. These tools are implemented using the dynamic geometry software, iGeom, which has been used in a geometry course since 2004 and has a successful track record in the classroom. Empowered with these new features, iGeom simplifies teachers' tasks, solves non-trivial problems in student solutions and helps to increase student motivation by providing feedback in real time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The research question is: what are the challenges of one first-year school director in Baja California, Mexico? Design/methodology/ approach - Arnulfo participated in an interview and five focus groups at the Ensenada State Normal School. He kept a journal of incidents completed during April-July 2006. A team of three researchers helped to write the case study. One researcher collected the data and wrote a summary in Spanish. A second researcher organized the material and translated it into English. The third researcher criticized and reviewed the write-up. Findings - Arnulfo faced a variety of challenges, but the burden of paperwork was the most serious. It can be understood on a number of levels. Bolman and Deal's four frames to understand organizations and leadership help to explain the complexity in terms of structural, human resource, symbolic, and political. The political frame was Arnulfo's greatest strength. He advocated for the school, formed alliances with parents, and took action to get the support of others. Practical implications - The analysis, if confirmed by broader studies with larger samples, would lead to several recommendations for educational administration preparation. Principals need to know about the structural tasks of paperwork; maintain relationships with supervisors to assure adequate support; understand the symbolic culture in which they work, and become savvy in the ways of politics. Originality/value - The International Study of Principal Preparation will compare findings and offer perspective on the extent to which these issues are representative of challenges that directors face in eight other countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-cultural management; Educational administration; Mexico; Principals",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349121411

Aim: This paper appraises the scope of student-selected components in a medical programme and analyses the relationships of achievement and motivation with choices of optional courses. Method: The prospective study involved 247 students from seven class-cohorts. Statistics checked the differences between groups, as well as the association between the students' academic motivation and achievement with the extent of their selections between optional courses and peer-tutoring activity. Results: Most students explored multiple options, including pre-clinical, clinical and non-medical subjects among the domains of learning experienced. A fifth of them earned more student-selected credits from optional courses than the requisite minimum. Twenty courses accounted for 80.2% of optional-course enrolments. Choices between optional courses and peer-tutoring activity reflected distinct learner features. Five variables-selective-credits need, achievement, intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation, and (negatively) peer-tutoring activity and intrinsic motivation to accomplish-explained 43% of the variability in optional-course credits. Nevertheless, a higher-level blend of optional-course and peer-tutoring selections related to greater cognitive achievement and intrinsic motivation. Conclusions: This work describes the variety of responses in extent and type of choices in a mix-option approach to student-selected credits.

Data obtained through one-to-one interviews went beyond mere yes/no answers to questions on belonging to a religion or believing in God.

In developing countries that do not have public universities, there has been a reduction of public financing and the expansion of private institutions. In Brazil, one of the main developing countries in the world context, such changes caused a rapid quantitative expansion in the number of students registered. However, the impact of such policies on the quality of the higher education system in the country is still unknown. There are questions about the real quality of higher education and about the effects of the markets in the improvement of the system quality. This paper describes a study of the development of the quality in the Brazilian higher education system, from 1994 to 2003, which was elaborated from a conceptual model of quality and from an international performance-indicator system. The results of this study indicate that marketisation policies in developing countries did not promote an improvement of the quality or the maximisation of the social benefits of higher education. In the period studied, no clear evidence of improvement in relevance, diversity, equity and effectiveness were found in the Brazilian higher education system.","Evaluation system; Higher education system; Markets in higher education; System-level indicators in higher education",,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","This paper was accomplished with support of CAPES, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior–Brazil.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249117088

In particular, the use of dynamic software becomes relevant to assemble geometric configurations that may help students reconstruct and examine mathematical relationships. In this process, students have the opportunity of formulating questions, making conjectures, presenting arguments and communicating results. This article illustrates that simple geometric configurations can be used to generate all conic sections studied in a regular course of analytic geometry. Observing and interpreting loci, searching for mathematical arguments (including empirical reasoning) and presenting results are problem-solving activities that seem to be enhanced with the use of dynamic software.

Results obtained show: Criterion 1, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that Planck's role in the origin of the quantum hypothesis was more at the level of an empirical adjustment, whereas Einstein provided the physical significance of the quantum hypothesis; Criterion 2, few textbooks (two satisfactory and four mentioned) included alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Bohm) and thus ignored that most theories are underdetermined by experimental evidence; Criterion 3, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that orbitals are mathematical constructs and the shapes of the orbitals (s, p, d, f) are not derived from quantum mechanics but instead from electron density measurements; Criterion 4, although, quantum mechanics approaches classical mechanics as a limiting case, none of the textbooks presented a framework to facilitate transition in student understanding from classical to quantum mechanics (28 textbooks made a simple mention); and Criterion 5, few textbooks (one satisfactory, five mentioned) facilitated the introduction of quantum numbers based on experimental determination of electron density (photoelectron spectrum).

This historical event is considered to be the deepest and most controversial milestone of the Argentine identity. October 12th is celebrated every year at Argentinean schools as part of a number of historic and patriotic celebrations. These celebrations are very common in many countries, even though in others, such as Spain, do not take place. An analysis of the historical and identity content of the subjects' narratives is undertaken as well as their process of change across ages. The youngest subjects' narratives (6 and 8 years of age) showed a rather concrete and personalistic comprehension, where the conflict between cultures is not considered. 10 and 12 year-olds narratives considered also western heroes, as Columbus, at the centre of their argument. 14 and 16 year-olds narratives were more abstracts and structural, but they possessed a historical understanding close to presentism. On the other hand, they portrayed a view of the ""Discovery of America"" very influenced by social darwinism, ie, progress historically justifies exploitation. Therefore, we conclude that historicpatriotic celebrations, such as October 12th, do not really contribute to a better understanding of history contents, but rather to the construction of a national identity, producing also presentist views about history school contents. © 2008 Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Construction of national identity; Historical narratives; Teaching history",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953400478

Information and communication technologies (ICT) can be of great help in the development of Higher Education Distance Learning, such as the Supervised Studies mentioned here, since such technologies make good use of, among other aspects, a bi-directional communicative model. In the case of the teaching of statistics, ICT appears to provide an important didactic support to help overcome certain difficulties in grasping fundamental statistical concepts. In the Internet, it is possible to find resources that can help change the way in which statistics is taught and to improve the understanding of basic ideas, above all in Distance Learning; hence our interest in learning how students on the Supervised Studies courses use these resources. To do this, a selected sample of such students was taken and each was given a questionnaire to find out how they used Internet resources designed for the teaching of statistics. The questionnaire included open and closed questions. The answers to the open questions were analyzed and classified into categories. The results indicate that although the students surveyed used the Internet to back up their studies, they did not use it frequently in Statistics courses in the Distance Education mode. Most students were unaware of the resources available in the Internet that could be used to learn Statistics. Thus, perhaps due to a lack of training in the use of this resource in Distance Learning, the Internet in this particular case remains in its infancy. © 2009 2002 Revista de Pedagogía.","Education and internet; Higher education distance learning; Learning statistics; Statistics teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449419874

With a focus on the perspectives of teachers, the study investigated the relationship between the teachers' conceptions of beginning algebra and their conceptions of their own teaching practices, with a view to unravelling their conceptions of change in their practices. Significant findings which threw light on the aforementioned relationship have been presented in Agudelo-Valderrama, Clarke and Bishop (2007), highlighting a direct association between a teacher's conceptions of the nature of beginning algebra, the crucial determinants of her/his teaching practice, and her/his attitude to change. After an overview of the study, this paper focuses on specific evidence which clearly shows that in contrast to the strong relationship between a teacher's conceptions of mathematics and her/his teaching practice, assumed in the theoretical model of teachers' thought structures, the teachers see a strong relationship between their conceptions of social/institutional factors of teaching and what they do in their teaching.

While the population as a whole, including the more deprived sectors, has improved its educational level over past decades, in more recent times there has been little to show for the considerable efforts made. It is as if the process had reached a ceiling, owing to practices of educational marginalization that are so embedded that they perpetually recreate themselves. The education system has lost its bearings because a new approach is needed with the emergence of the information and communication society, which implies a new definition of knowledge, cut off from its origins. The idea of ""including"" must also be a key notion in relation to the search for a fairer, more democratic society. This implies developing a number of viewpoints or fundamental attitudes when we consider inclusive education. There is the ideological/political point of view-which means developing the ideal of justice and democracy within the framework of education as a right; the epistemological aspect-which entails supporting the new educational approach in the very latest developments of the theory of complexity; the pedagogical aspect-which entails adopting the advances made in the new learning sciences in order to develop a new ""technology of educational production"" (didactics) that will guarantee the entire population's ability to reason; and the institutional point of view-which requires reviewing the notion of a ""school system"" and incorporating other institutional spaces by considering the whole of society as offering potential ""learning environments"". © 2008 UNESCO IBE.","Education reform; Inclusive education; Learning environment; Social inclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54349095571

Significant barriers exist to ensuring the world's people receive basic healthcare, including oral healthcare. Amongst these are poverty, ignorance, inadequate financial resources and lack of adequate numbers of educated and trained (oral) healthcare workers. Emerging economies are encouraged to develop a national strategic plan for oral health. International organizations have developed goals for oral health that can be referenced and adapted by emerging economies as they seek to formulate specific objectives for their countries. Demographic data that assess the nature and extent of oral diseases in a country are essential to sound planning and the development of an oral healthcare system that is relevant, effective and economically viable. Prevention should be emphasized and priority consideration be given to oral healthcare for children. The types and numbers of members of the oral healthcare team (workforce) will vary from country to country depending on the system developed. Potential members of the workforce include: generalist dentists, specialist dentists, dental therapists, dental hygienists, denturists, expanded function dental assistants (dental nurses) and community oral health workers/aides. Competences for dentists, and other members of the team, should be developed to ensure quality care and developed economies should cooperate with emerging economies. The development, by more advanced economies, of digital, virtual curricula, which could be used by emerging economies for educating and training members of the oral healthcare team, should be an important initiative. The International Federation of Dental Educators and Associations (IFDEA) should lead in such an effort. © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard and The American Dental Education Association.","Education/training; Emerging economies; National oral healthcare plan; Oral healthcare workforce","article; child; clinical competence; dental assistant; dental care; dental education; dentist; dentistry; developing country; economics; ethics; general practice; health; health auxiliary; health care delivery; health care planning; health care quality; human; legal aspect; methodology; organization; organization and management; patient care; preventive dentistry; standard; teaching; Child; Clinical Competence; Community Health Aides; Delivery of Health Care; Dental Auxiliaries; Dental Care; Dental Care for Children; Dentists; Developing Countries; Education, Dental; General Practice, Dental; Health Planning; Health Priorities; Health Resources; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Oral Health; Organizational Objectives; Patient Care Team; Preventive Dentistry; Quality of Health Care; Specialties, Dental; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049120085

With rapid societal changes, including globalization and consumerism, the roles of universities and their funding have become intensely debated topics. When financial burdens on universities increase, so does the pressure on dental schools. This is exacerbated by the relative expense of running dental schools and also by the limited understanding of both university managers and the public of the nature and scope of dentistry as a profession. In these circumstances, it is essential for dental schools to have good systems of leadership and management in place so that they can not only survive in difficult times, but flourish in the longer term. This paper discusses the concept of governance and how it relates to leadership, management and administration in dental schools and hospitals. Various approaches to governance and management in dental schools on different continents and regions are summarized and contrasted. A number of general governance and leadership issues are addressed. For example, a basic principle supported by the Working Group is that an effective governance structure must link authority and responsibility to performance and review, i.e. accountability, and that the mechanism for achieving this should be transparent. The paper also addresses issues specific to governing, leading and managing dental schools. Being a dean of a modern dental school is a very demanding role and some issues relating to this role are raised, including: dilemmas facing deans, preparing to be dean and succession planning. The importance of establishing a shared vision and mission, and creating the right culture and climate within a dental school, are emphasized. The Working Group advocates establishing a culture of scholarship in dental schools for both teaching and research. The paper addresses the need for effective staff management, motivation and development, and highlights the salience of good communication. The Working Group suggests establishing an advisory board to the dean and school, including lay persons and other external stakeholders, as one way of separating governance and management to some extent and providing some checks and balances within a dental school. Several other suggestions and recommendations are made about governance, management and leadership issues, including the need for schools to promote an awareness of their roles by good communication and thereby influence perceptions of others about their roles and values. © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard and The American Dental Education Association.","Deans; Dental leadership; Dental schools; Global; Management systems; Organization","advisory committee; article; board of trustees; clinical competence; dental education; dental research; economics; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical education; motivation; organ culture technique; organization; organization and management; peer review; personnel management; social behavior; social change; standard; teaching; teaching hospital; Advisory Committees; Clinical Competence; Communication; Dental Research; Education, Dental; Fellowships and Scholarships; Governing Board; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Leadership; Motivation; Organ Culture Techniques; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Peer Review; Schools, Dental; Social Change; Social Responsibility; Staff Development; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049104255

F., Mexico","This paper focuses on the analysis of certain didactic resources that proliferated on the fringes of schooling during the second half of the nineteenth century in Mexico. The first of these is a method that, according to its author, made it possible to teach a pupil how to read in only six lessons, dated 1830; the second is a writing method from 1870, which according to the author would enable a teacher to teach large groups, and any person to learn alone; the third, from 1880, consists of a ""machine"" for teaching in schools that made it possible to practise reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar and other subjects through direct experience. Each method offers the opportunity of exploring various conceptions about teaching. The first concerns the basics of teaching. The second deals with conceptions of memorising, and the third illustrates conceptions based on experience and intuition as points of departure for learning. The didactic devices selected are objects specific to teaching, inspired by the principles of the nascent nineteenth-century project of schooling, that set in motion routines linked to the learning of the basic skills of writing, reading and general knowledge, and were produced by teachers whose inspiration was cultivated by their own experience. Yet they are far from forming part of the set of objects used in schooling: slates, pencils, blackboards, exercise books, posters, cupboards, etc.; rather they make up a less common set of ephemeral and fragmentary objects, minor or secondary objects in the landscape of the classroom; in some cases they even constitute waste products of formal schooling that, despite their marginal status - or perhaps because of it - offer us a window onto the intricate relationships and porous frontiers between the school and other social spaces. The author is particularly interested in the processes of re-signification and hybridisation between erudite knowledges (the pedagogical knowledge of the time) and ""popular knowledges"".","Literacy practices; Literacy technologies; Pedagogical responsibilities; Popular knowledges on literacy instruction",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549120142

When single-phase viscous fluids are fully developed, the velocity profiles are invariant with the axial coordinate, while the temperature distributions do vary with it. Since the 2-D momentum equation corresponds to a 2-D heat conduction equation, the 2-D velocity profiles supply the product of the friction factor and the Reynolds number, f Re. By implementing the transversal method of lines (TMOL) in the sub-domain z → 0, the 3-D energy equation is transformed into an equivalent quasi 2-D heat conduction equation. The local convective coefficient asymptotes hc, z→0 changing with the axial coordinate z → 0 come from the quasi 2-D temperature distributions. The fRe and hc, z→0 results have been synthesized for commensureate fin configurations in the sub-domain z → 0 of the heat exchange region where the largest heat transfer activity occurs. The modeling and numerical simulation of the present heat/fluid flow problem articulates concepts learned by students in courses on fluid mechanics, heat transfer and numerical methods.","Convective coefficient; Finned tube; Friction factor; TMOL","Fins (heat exchange); Fluid mechanics; Friction; Heat transfer; Image coding; Laminar flow; Numerical methods; Reynolds number; Temperature distribution; Tribology; Tubes (components); Welding electrodes; Convective coefficient; Finned tube; Friction factors; Heat conduction equations; Internally finned tubes; TMOL; Transversal method of lines; Two-dimensional heat conduction; Heat conduction",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887220815

Different researchers on intellectual capital (IC) agree on the issue that at present, knowledge generates sustainable competitive advantage. However, the distinction between the theoretical perspective and its practical application is not yet clear. Seemingly, this dissociation may be explained by the absence of an epistemological analysis related to IC, which accounts for the low number of pertinent specific publications. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyzes the named epistemological foundations associated with the concept of IC, from the point of view of the cognitive sciences, as well as its consequences in the design of methods and indicators of evaluation. The analysis employed is based on the cognitive groundwork of the representational and non-representational schools linked to the primeval concepts which thus far support the definition of IC. Findings - The cognitive sciences contribute guidance in the face of the implications of including IC within the domain of representation and that of non-representation. The first operates in order to recover external elements and to project internal ones, making IC unviable as a process, and inevitably reduces it to the account of objects. In the second case, enactment ends up being incomplete due to the fact that it maintains the observer-setting duality, which makes it improbable to understand IC as a network relational process. Originality/value - The results enable the identification of new lines of development, which clarify and make explicit its epistemological foundations, but which differ from the prevailing ones. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive advantage; Epistemology; Intellectual capital; Knowledge economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70049095924

The theoretical framework of the study is the field of ethno-mathematics - shaped by post-structuralist theorizing, especially Michel Foucault's thinking, and the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein in his work Philosophical investigations. The data examined in the article consist of narratives produced by seven settlers who studied at the school during that period and a text written by one of the research participants. The analytical exercise carried out showed that: a) the school mathematics developed in that institution was instituted as a set of language games marked by writing and formalism; b) the mathematics generated by the settlers' everyday activities shaped language games constituted by another grammar, marked by rules such as orality, decomposition, estimations and rounding, which constitute rationality criteria that are different from those of the school mathematics language games.","Ethno-mathematics; Post-structuralist theorizing; School mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-65449176068

We take for our analysis the results published in the fourth edition of the research entitled National Index of Functional Literacy (INAF), carried out in 2004, which evaluated the conditions and efficiency of the Brazilian young and adult populations in mobilizing mathematical skills to carry out daily tasks, and in which the results obtained by the male population were regarded as significantly superior to those achieved by the female population. Based on a reflection grounded in a Foucauldian perspective, we seek to understand these results as articulated to a discursive field marked by a mathematical rationality of Cartesian matrix. Analyzing under such perspective the mechanisms that contribute to degrade women's performance in comparison with men's in assessments of this kind - concerned as they are with the ability to give answers regarded as adequate in the execution of daily tasks regarded as relevant - our attention is focused on identifying another instance of production of inequalities between men and women, represented here by the valuation (in social life and in the assessments) of certain manners of conceiving and reacting to daily demands. As educators we are interested in unveiling the production of inequalities, so as to deconstruct certain discourses that favor them, and in bringing about other perspectives of analysis and pedagogical action.","Gender; Inequality; Mathematical literacy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-62649112487

By understanding the term ""conception"" on the basis of Peirce's pragmatism, a set of methodological parameters are produced denominated ""indirect method"" - to be applied in the study of Mathematics teachers' conceptions. In summary, we want to investigate teachers' conceptions asking them not about their beliefs, but about their practices. After presenting the foundations of this indirect approach, and of making explicit its qualitative nature, the study proceeds to exemplify it with an exercise of this ""indirect method"", a study about the criteria used by teachers to select textbooks for their classes, thereby dealing with the conceptions of Mathematics and of its teaching and learning that such criteria disclose. Based on testimonies of Mathematics teachers, the study suggests that teachers act with some independence when they choose the materials to be used in their classes. At the same time, they draw from a wide range of textbooks, disregarding the specificities of each work and the approaches and perspectives espoused by their authors. Although they submit to textbooks - regarded as a legitimate and reliable source - teachers subvert them, trying to making them adequate to what they consider correct. From this observation, some of the teachers' conceptions can be highlighted: the pupil is usually evaluated and classified according to their deficiencies with respect to the contents. From this position follows the high value placed upon the logical precedence of the contents, their linear presentation, and the defense of ""prerequisites"" that would make teaching possible and, consequently, imply the legitimacy of predominantly expository classes.","Conceptions; Mathematical education; Mathematics textbooks; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-62549088650

The conditions inducing doctors to reflect are largely unknown. The authors investigated whether a shift to reflection occurs when physicians perceive a case as problematic, and its effects on diagnostic accuracy. Method: The authors conducted two withinsubjects experiments in Brazilian teaching hospitals in 2007. In Experiment 1, 20 medical residents diagnosed the same 10 clinical cases under two experimental conditions: a nonproblematic versus a problematic context. (The latter was created by informing participants that other physicians failed to diagnose the case previously.) In addition, participants judged whether a set of medical concepts were related to the case, and response time was measured. In Experiment 2, 18 residents diagnosed two cases while thinking aloud. The authors hypothesized that a case perceived as problematic would trigger reflection, leading to higher diagnostic accuracy, lower response times for recognizing concepts (Experiment 1), more time for diagnosing, and more elaborate think-aloud protocols (Experiment 2). Results: Experiment 1: Accuracy of diagnosis was significantly higher within the problematic context, and participants were faster in deciding whether concepts were related to the case. The same cases were evaluated as more complex and less frequently seen. Experiment 2: Time spent on diagnosis, memory for case findings, and inferences derived from the cases were significantly higher within the problematic context. Conclusions: A context perceived as problematic induced reflection in the participating clinicians, as indicated by lower response times, more time spent on diagnosis, and more elaborate protocols. Reflective reasoning comprised more careful analysis of findings and alternative diagnoses, and increased diagnostic accuracy.",,"article; case finding; clinical decision making; clinical practice; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; diagnostic reasoning; hypothesis; physician; priority journal; resident; response time; university hospital; adult; analysis of variance; Brazil; case report; clinical competence; decision support system; differential diagnosis; evaluation; female; human; male; medical education; perception; statistics; teaching hospital; thinking; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Brazil; Clinical Competence; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Social Perception; Thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849136658

In 1659, motivated by Pascal challenge, Huygens showed experimentally that the cycloid is the solution to the tautochrone problem, namely that of finding a curve such that the time taken by a particle sliding down to its lowest point, under uniform gravity, is independent of its starting point. Ever since, this problem has appeared in many books and papers that show different solutions. In particular, the fractional derivative formalism has been used to solve the problem for an arbitrary potential and also to put forward the inverse problem: what potential is needed in order for a particular trajectory to be a tautochrone?

The starting point is the electrostatic potential, which is obtained in any introductory course of electromagnetism from the Coulomb potential and the superposition principle for any charge distribution. The necessity to develop solutions to the Laplace and Poisson differential equations is also recognized, identifying the Coulomb potential as the generating function of harmonic functions. Correspondingly, the convenience of expressing the electrostatic potential in terms of its multipole expansion in spherical coordinates, or as integral transforms based on harmonic functions in different coordinate systems, is also established. These connections provide a motivation for teachers and students to acquire the necessary mathematics as a basic tool in the study of electromagnetic theory, optics and quantum mechanics.","Electrostatics; Laplace and Poisson equations; Spherical and circular cylindrical harmonic functions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849115554

Since students become familiar with Taylor expansions in earlier calculus and mathematical methods for physicist courses, one finds this approach of presenting this new discretization scheme to be more easily handled in courses on numerical computations of both undergraduate and graduated programs. The robustness of the resulting discretized equations will be illustrated by finding the numerical solution of an essentially hard-to-solve, one-dimensional, boundary-layer-like problem, based on the steady diffusion equation. Moreover, given that the presented mimetic discretization scheme attains second-order accuracy in the entire computational domain (including the boundaries), as a comparative exercise the discretized equations can be readily applied in solving examples commonly found in texbooks on applied numerical methods and solved numerically via other discretization schemes (including some of the standard finitediffence discretization schemes).","Boundary layer; Diffusion equation; Finite difference; Mimetic discretizations; Partial differential equations; Taylor expansions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849101827

Mental performance tests range in complexity and include subjective estimates of mood, simple objective tests (reaction time), and measures of complex performance that require decisions to be made and priorities set. Mental performance tasks show 2 components, a circadian rhythm and the effects of time awake. The circadian rhythm is in phase with the rhythm of core temperature and there is evidence for a causal link. Increasing time awake results in performance deterioration and is attributed to fatigue. The relative contribution of these 2 components depends upon the task under consideration; simple tasks generally show smaller effects due to increasing time awake. These contributions have been assessed by constant routines and forced desynchronization protocols and have formed the basis of several mathematical models that attempt to predict performance in a variety of field conditions. Mental performance is negatively affected by sleep loss; although short naps are beneficial, sleep inertia limits their value immediately after waking. The processes involved in cognition include attention (tonic and phasic alertness, and selective and sustained attention), working memory (phonological, used for speech, reading, and writing; and visuospatial, used for spatial processing, drawing, and mathematics), and executive function (initiative, decision making, and problem solving). These processes are illuminated by analysis of the regions of the brain involved, the presence of circadian rhythmicity, and the effects of sleep loss. The results from such laboratory- and field-based observations are relevant to the issue of learning in schoolchildren and lead to suggestions for improving their performance. © Journal Compilation © 2008 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Blackwell Publishing, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-60449106442

In this article, we present some results from an evaluation study that looked at teachers' practice with these tools, their assimilation of the pedagogical model and the impact of the use of the programme on students' learning. The results show that teacher-training remains insufficient and that teachers have great difficulties in changing their practice as conceived by the programme. The use of the technological tools in schools is also very inconsistent. For students, the benefit of the technology-based activities remains difficult to assess, and there is no visible impact on learning as measured by items used in national evaluations (although there seems to be a correlation between the tools used and the learning of different mathematical topics).

Nevertheless, the results also highlighted a number of issues underlying the discussion about effectiveness of interpretation in the university context i.e.: the quality of the interpreter preparedness, previous understanding or preparation of the subject matter content, difficulties in the relation to Portuguese/Libras, difficulties in the relationships between interpreter and teacher, among others. From these considerations, it is clear that the Brazilian scene for education of deaf people reflects the lack of involvement of public authorities as to deaf education. There are still a great many linguistic and social challenges related to deaf education at the university level. This study intends to present an initial discussion about interpreters at the university level, nevertheless, much still has to be understood in order for effective changes to occur.","Brazilian sign language; Deafness; Sign language interpreter; Special education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-55849083959

From the methodological point of view, the data were gathered by means of a questionnaire with 14 open questions. In addition to the general approach, the analysis introduces a double comparative point of view: between the two sexes and different levels of schooling. Research by Bernard Charlot and Claudine Blanchard-Laville on the relation with knowledge provides the theoretical framework. The results suggest that pupils have a better relationship with everyday objects and practices, like counting money, than with specifically mathematical objects.

We also calculate the investment in terms of teachers and classrooms/shift-year necessary to settle this debt. We also show that the debt estimated from the National Survey by Household Sampling 2005 (316.4 million years of study) represents a very small reduction with respect to the 2000 Census. Lastly, we deal with the question of the actors or agents of the effectiveness of the right to Education and of the instruments of accountability place at their disposal by the legislation. The article concludes by affirming the great challenge put before society in general and educators in particular of producing in the simple folk the awareness that they effectively have a right to Education, and that they have the means of demanding their fulfillment by the State.","Brazil; Educational debt; Right to education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149113932

Examples of these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion, individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion of ""CiC"". The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage of both this system and standard software are compared and research results are presented.

In 1994, the government created the Family Health Program to help carry out that goal. However, the dearth of family physicians in Brazil-the central figures in that program-limits the program's effectiveness. The lack of family physicians can be traced primarily to the medical schools, which at that time were not training such physicians. This, in turn, can be traced to a number of conditions in Brazil (e.g., the bias toward specialization in both medical education and care) that favor specialists and discourage generalists.In 1992, a group of physicians founded an academic society in São Paulo to promote the humanistic dimensions of doctoring and ""establish the proper basis and scientific methodology for family medicine."" The society's board eventually began teaching humanistic medicine to medical students, who became interested in family medicine. The board realized that its mission should expand to find ways to introduce and integrate family medicine into the medical schools of Brazil, to establish family medicine's academic credentials, help attract students to family medicine as a career, and secure family medicine's credibility in the marketplace. Since that time, the society has developed a variety of initiatives involving students, faculty, and medical schools to pursue these goals.

Está na hora da Escola [Wake up Brazil! It's school time], there were still no studies demonstrating the practical results of this action, either in the improvement of education or in the implications of resizing the public and private spheres, a hotly debated subject. With information obtained From interviews, and From assessments and analysis of several documents, it was possible to see that the current expectations about the efficiency in the management and transfer of resources in sufficient amounts and quality were not met. Nevertheless, the numbers involved in the program, large when compared to other similar initiatives, contributed to build a positive image with the public opinion. Although it cannot be said that the initiative did result in a private sway that redefined the public character of the state and municipal school systems under its influence, there are evidences that the implementation of the Moto Perpétuo Program was subjected to the public-private (federal government-Fiat) relationships, representing a new chapter centered on ""education"" in a history that emphasizes cooperation agreements of a political or economical nature.","Business-school; Fiat; Moto Perpétuo Program; Public-private",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249164756

The basic formation, which is responsible for developing the students skills, by giving them subsidies to exert the citizenship and also to improve in their jobs and future studies, has a very important role in the result of the university contest. Open to people who had finished high school and passed the examinations, higher education must be accessible to everyone during their whole lives. Our goal with this paper was to check if the first and the last ones placed in the university contest for the biology course keep the same results during the course, and what factors contribute to the continuity or not of this performance. To collect these data, questionnaires were given to the first and lost five candidates classified in the vestibular contest for the two modalities of the biology course: licentiate and bachelor of biology; it also analyzed the academic descriptions of the students, in order to see their performance in the disciplines. To siudy the results a statistic analysis was made. We conclude that, in general, the first placed students perform better than the last ones, and reasons like basic formation (basic and average education), work and the age of the pupils are related to their performance during the course. The two analyzed groups show peculiar characteristics, and the period when the courses are offered makes a big difference, because it encloses a very distinct group, and, as a consequence, it reflects very different data. The test of the university contest immediately separates the students who are prepared to enroll the university from those who aren't, besides that, other reasons like: family, job, primary formation and identification to the course also determine the performance of these pupils. Other researches that aim to characterize the socio-economic condition and also the learning conditions of each pupil seems to be necessary to affirm that these reasons contribute to a good or bad performance.","Higher education; Student workers; Vestibular",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249130794

Recently, the Chilean Congress passed Law # 20.027 of 2005, which provides the legal framework for the creation of a student loan system guaranteed both by the State and by higher education institutions (HEIs), financed by the private capital market through the securitization of the loans. The system operated for the first time in 2006, where approximately 21,000 students were able to access financing of their higher education for the remainder of their careers. It is expected that as the system matures, more and better information will be available, which will benefit the students and the HEIs; and it is highly likely that the current number of financed students could grow significantly in the next few years.

Appropriate care and education in the early years are far more useful than dealing with later problems, and in both the United States and Brazil scholars and public-policy makers have argued that the goal should be an integrated system of care and education. Using a cultural-historical framework to understand early childhood policies in the United States and Brazil, we examine how notions of care and education have changed over time. We show that although the two societies have the same goal, the approaches to realizing that goal have been, for historical reasons, quite different. Moreover, despite a rapid growth in the numbers of children attending preschool institutions, integrated systems have not been accomplished. Our analysis also shows how the legacy of a dichotomous approach in both societies has impeded the integration of care and education into a single system. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Brazil; Child care; Early education; Historical changes; Preschool; Public policy; Social class; Socioeconomic status; United States of America","article; Brazil; child care; comparative study; consensus development; cultural value; early childhood intervention; economic aspect; education program; history; social class; socioeconomics; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749192527

Using an interactional ethnographic approach, we explore how potentials for developing local identities were related to the ways in which the teacher and students formulated who can do and/or say what, to and with whom, when, where, under what conditions, for what purposes, and with what outcomes and consequences. By examining these questions, we explored community, personal, and academic positions and positionings constructed by members, and how these positions/positionings created identity potentials for both the collective and individuals-within-the-collective. Two questions guided our exploration of the construction of identity potentials: How did the teacher initiate locally constructed processes and practices that shaped what counted as students, teacher, and other collective, institutional and academic identities on the first morning of school? What evidence exists on the first morning and in end of the year essays that students took up the discursive patterns and practices of the classroom as material resources in (re)formulating local identities? By examining these questions, we explored how a fifth grade bilingual teacher and the linguistically diverse members of her class, collectively and individually formulated and negotiated situated definitions of what one was supposed to know and learn as well as what it meant to be a student, a mathematician, and a community member among other local identities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A sample of 275 first semester students in the School of Economics and Social Science at the University of Carabobo in Venezuela was selected. Based on a non-experimental ex post facto statistical analysis, the results show some evidence of variation in the dimensions of math performance due to the type of academic aid used by the students to complement the course activities. Additionally, some differences were found between the traditional assessment (math achievement) of math content and the experimental assessment method (math performance).","Cognitive measurement; College mathematics; Mathematical logic; Set theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892145870

In my memory, our discussions on these issues were very influential to my thinking. The importance of the support given by Hans-Georg to the development of mathematics education worldwide will be underlined. Both in the position of the chairman of the International Program Committee of ICME 3 and in the early years of the IDM in Bielefeld, Hans-Georg provided the material and intellectual space for the strengthening of Didactics of Mathematics as a research field.

Methods and Results: From May 2003 to December 2004, 108 residents from 17 cardiology residency programs in Buenos Aires were monitored by the educational board of the Argentine Society of Cardiology. Validity was evaluated by the instrument's capability to discriminate between pre-existing levels of clinical seniority. For reliability, generalisability theory was used. Feasibility was defined by a minimum number of completed observations: 50% of the residents obtaining at least four Mini-CEX's. Satisfaction was evaluated through a one to nine rating scale from the evaluators, and residents' perspectives. The total number of encounters was 253. Regarding validity, Mini-CEX was able to discriminate significantly between residents of different seniority. Reliability analysis indicated that a minimum of ten evaluations are necessary to produce a minimally reliable inference, but more are preferable. Feasibility was poor: 15% of the residents were evaluated four or more times during the study period. High satisfaction ratings from evaluators' and residents' were achieved. Conclusion: Mini-CEX discriminates between pre-existing levels of seniority, requires considerable sampling to achieve sufficient reliability, and was not feasible within the current circumstances, but it was considered a valuable assessment tool as indicated by the evaluators' and residents' satisfaction ratings.",,"Argentina; article; cardiology; clinical assessment tool; clinical evaluation; continuing education provider; controlled study; education program; educational theory; feasibility study; human; mini clinical evaluation exercise; observational study; qualitative validity; quality control; rating scale; reliability; residency education; resident; student satisfaction; validity; clinical competence; consumer; education; medical education; methodology; reproducibility; validation study; Argentina; Cardiology; Clinical Competence; Consumer Satisfaction; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549087018

In the present study, we investigated the impact of the implementation and use of computers in the public school system, from the elementary grades to high school, in Niterói city, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). This city, with a total population of approximately 500,000, was chosen for this study based on the claim it offers the best educational project in Brazil, and on the fact that it is ranked as the first city in terms of digital inclusion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the second one in all Brazil, according to IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (Census 2000). This is a rather significant standings and represents an important qualitative and quantitative feature in comparison to other Brazilian municipalities and even to the experience in other countries. In our survey, we found that 82% of the municipal elementary schools (from the 1st to 4th grades, equivalent to the elementary school system in the US, and to the first phase of secondary education in France, and 32% of the state schools, including secondary school (high school system in the US, and the 2nd phase of secondary education in France) have computer laboratories. Difficulties were observed, such as the adequacy of teachers' training and continuing education, computer laboratory schedule, number of computers available, and equipment maintenance. In this context, this work is useful for the establishment of policies of implementation and use of this technology in Brazil, since as yet there is no established world policy, despite UNESCO initiatives. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These strengths are responsible by the phenomenon known as ""Biefeld-Brown effect"" believed to be a new physical principle due to the electromagnetism and gravitation. Asymmetric capacitor is a capacitor whose geometry of the electrodes differs from each other. The experimental results show that when a high voltage is applied to the capacitor a resulting force acts on it, which is produced by the collision of the ions that are formed in the air (ionic wind) at vicinities of the electrodes. This resulting force promotes the so called ""levitation-effect"" that makes the capacitor floating in the air. The system developed here have been used in classroom demonstrations for undergraduate and graduate students of the Federal University of Santa Catarina and for colleagues of the physics department provoking great excitement and discussions on the subject.

Household characteristics and dog population size, health and reproductive issues were compared between the two kinds of communities: urban and rural. A telephone survey was conducted in Merida city whereas personal interviews were used in the rural communities. Local veterinarians were also interviewed to evaluate their influence on the dog populations in Merida city. The ratio of people to dogs was 3.4:1 in the city, and 1.7:1 to 4.6:1 in the different rural communities. In general it was more common to find a dog-owning household in the city of Merida (72.8%) than in the rural areas (63.6%, 65.5% and 71.1%), and in the city more households had adequate fences to restrain dogs. Larger families were more likely to own a dog than small families. Households of medium socio-economic status had a significantly higher probability of owning a dog than households of low or high socio-economic status. Of the dogs in the city, 90.1% were vaccinated against rabies compared with 62.3% of the dogs in the rural communities. Most animals were intact; the frequency of neutering/spaying was 3.1 % in Merida and 1.8% in the rural communities. Few private veterinary practitioners were involved in the control of dog over-population. It is concluded that dogs are popular pets both in urban and rural Yucatan. People's opinions about dogs and the level of supervision varied with socio-economic status, and people in the city provided better food, shelter and preventive medicine. The veterinary practitioners did little to promote the control of dog breeding or to reduce the relinquishing of unwanted dogs in the city. Better client education and the promotion of sterilization of pets at low cost would improve the situation. © ISAZ 2007.","Dogs; Mexico; Overpopulation; Rural; Urban","Animalia; Canis familiaris",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34648814036

We then use hierarchical linear models to explore whether reform teaching is associated with student achievement in mathematics and with student socioeconomic status (SES). Our results indicate that reform and traditional teaching are not opposite sides of a one-dimensional axis. They also emphasize both that reform teaching is related to higher school average achievement in mathematics and that the dissemination of reform teaching contributes to minimize the achievement gap between students who attend schools with low average SES and students who attend schools with high average SES.

In past years Chile has suffered annual losses of around $150 million because of one particular infectious disease that has plagued the salmon industry. In an attempt to find a vaccine against this disease, a partnership was formed between the Science Foundation for Life, a non-profit foundation with the goal of stimulating the use of biotechnology by the Chilean productive sector, and the Millennium Institute of Fundamental and Applied Biology, a group focused on the improvement and impact of the biological sciences in Chile. In an interview with the Director of the Science Foundation for Life, Pablo Valenzuela, it was disclosed that the project was able to raise $2 million for this research thanks to collaborative support from the government-funding agency Corfo, Fundación Chile and Bios Chile (Conicyt, undated). The research focus was on detecting the genes responsible for the disease. In light of the results, the researchers were able to separate sixteen genes that provided the necessary characteristics for vaccine development (Argandona, 2004).

Latin America has been internationally known for its higher percentage of young compared with elderly persons. The United Nations predicts that the proportion of elderly persons in Latin America and the Caribbean will be more similar to world figures in 2020 and even higher in 2040. The increasing elderly population in Latin America has increased the demand for advanced degree professionals with gerontology training. Nevertheless, in spite of training efforts during the last decade, the number of gerontology professionals is still insufficient. In total, the authors were able to locate only ten gerontology programs in Latin America (four in Brazil, two in Argentina, and one each in Uruguay, Peru, Cuba, and Colombia). The programs currently available in Brazil and Colombia are described in an effort to share information on the common characteristics of Master's and PhD degree programs in gerontology in Latin America.

Learning and Motivation, in press) observed that, within limits, the level of consummatory responding of rats exposed to incentive downshifts in the concentration of sucrose solutions was similar when the ratio of test/training solutions was the same. For example, 32 → 4% and 16 → 2% downshifts (1:8 test/training ratios) lead to similar levels of consummatory behavior, despite differences in the absolute concentrations of the solutions involved in the downshift. This suggests the applicability of Weber's law to spaced-trial, incentive-downshift situations. Experiment 1 extended these results to runway performance using food pellets as reward, and Experiment 2 to lever pressing performance, using an autoshaping procedure and sucrose solutions as rewards. The results conform well to the test/training ratio suggesting that Weber's law is applicable to anticipatory behavior.

The IIRM are educational software components, specializing in mathematical concepts, presented through recreational mathematics, conceived as interactive, recreation-oriented learning objects, integrated within the environment. We present the architecture of the learning environment which integrates communication services that support the interaction processes of the learning community, through instant messaging, chat rooms, and multi-player math games. Through the environment's interface of their personal workspace, students have access to several easy-to-use mechanisms that allows them to customize its content, its layout, and its appearance. At internal levels, the functionality of IIRM is enhanced with features supported by the environment infrastructure. We evaluated different aspects of the learning environment in three short, motivation-oriented math courses given to Mexican high-school students. The results indicate that the use of the IIRM-based electronic learning environment, positively affects student attitudes towards mathematics.

Identity also determines disposition toward schooling because it may have the capacity to shape and modify the values, beliefs and characteristics that distinguish one person from another, by means of pedagogical practices and institutional arrangements. This article, therefore, examines the notion of identity that Amartya Sen proposed, and how it can be used to study the social and education disadvantages that indigenous people face in Mexico. This argument unfolds in four stages. The first part will discuss the notion of identity that Amartya Sen developed. The second will show some facts and figures about Mexico's indigenous population, while the third will stress some pervasive educational inequalities that ethnic groups face. The fourth, and final, part will present some results of an affirmative action program that a number of universities in Mexico have implemented. It concludes by showing that further analysis is required in order to obtain a broader understand of how identity is formed and transformed within education spaces and that this, ultimately, may advance the current notion of identity proposed by Sen. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, for lower-viscosity fluids such as water, the experiment is harder to do using simple instruments, and the results are less precise due to the high terminal speed of the falling spheres. A number of experiments have been described for determining the viscosity of liquids from their rate of flow through a tube.1,2 In this paper we describe a method in which the low-viscosity liquid is allowed to flow through a horizontal capillary tube.

Grounded on studies carried out in Argentina by Ferreiro and Teberosky (1986), with children without intellectual disabilities, we deal, comparatively, with three aspects in the development of literacy in children with intellectual disabilities: their interpretation of fragments of writing, the connection they establish between letters and numbers, and their knowledge of letters. The level of intellectual disability just as the stimulation to reading are taken into account in the analysis of data related to the three aspects previously mentioned. Children with intellectual disabilities develop, in many aspects, similarly to the children without intellectual disabilities during emergent literacy. Nevertheless, they are less consistent in the use of writing classifying criteria, as well as in their discriminating letters from numbers. Although, the level of intellectual disability influenced the children's progress greatly, the acquisition of the knowledge of letters differed mostly in accordance to the level of stimulation to reading. © International Association for the Improvement of Mother Tongue Education.","Compared studies in literacy; Emergent literacy; Intellectual disability",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908083128

The plots of the solutions at different times allow us to create animations of the solutions. We show in a general framework how to make animations in Maple and Matlab. These animations can be used as a didactic tool in order to introduce some physical phenomena such as: wave propagation, superposition, transmission from one medium to another, diffusion, etc. They can also be used to motive the students to the study of partial differential equations and its applications. A representative subset of differential equations of mathematical physics was chosen that includes: the transport equation, wave equation, heat equation and equations of Klein Gordon, Korteweg de Vries, and Maxwell. We briefly present some of the analytical methods for the solutions of pdes: scaling, characteristics and separation of variables. Finally exact solutions can be very useful for code testing in numerical implementations.","Education aids; Partial differential equations; Physics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860664777

In the case of the angular variable ν (-1 ≤ ν ≤1); the solutions are the well known first class Chebyshev polynomials. However, in the case of the radial variable ε (1≤ε < ∞) it is necessary to construct another independent solution which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in the current literature nor in textbooks; this new solution can be constructed either by a Fröbenius series representation or by using the standard methods through the knowledge of the first solution (first-class Chebyshev polynomials). In any case, either must lead to the same result because of linear independence. Once we know these functions, the complete solution of a twodimensional Laplace equation in this coordinate system can be constructed accordingly, and it could be used to study a variety of boundaryvalue electrostatic problems involving infinite dielectric or conducting cylinders and lines of charge of this shape, since with this information, the corresponding Green's function for the Laplace operator can also be readily obtained using the procedures outlined in standard textbooks on mathematical physics. These aspects are dealt with and discussed in the present work and some useful trends regarding applications of the results are also given in the case of an explicit example, namely, the case of a dielectric elliptic cylinder and an infinite line of charge.","Chebyshev functions; Elliptic coordinates; Green function; Two-dimensional Laplace equation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860629192

In this paper, we describe the Repository of Objects with Semantic Access (ROSA) project. ROSA is a LCMS that provides users with a conceptual map view of courses. We present ROSA data model designed as an extension to RDF data model with ordered collections, relationship properties and cardinality constraints. An algebra is proposed with operations supporting queries over LO metadata and navigation through conceptual maps. Relationship properties are implicitly considered during navigation. User queries can be expressed through a high-level query language, directed by a browsing interface or based on keyword search over LO attribute values. Additionally, a thesaurus is used during query processing extending the domain vocabulary with synonyms, generic/specific and Associated Terms (ATs). Furthermore, ROSA supports the contextualisation of conceptual maps through an extension based on Topic Maps (TM). Finally, the system provides users with a computable semantic layer representation of conceptual maps, which includes course modelling and course material management, leveraging current LCMS. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","context; database; e-learning; learning-object; ontologies; RDF; semantic data model; semantic web; XML",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449371451

The average age of the subjects was 22.4 years. Descriptive, bivariate, simple logistic regression and multiple logistic regression (Stepwise Forward Procedure) analyses were performed, with the significance level set at p< or =0.05. Of the total 167 individuals who had been exposed to biological material, 120 (71.9 percent) failed to report the accidents. The variables that were statistically associated with the nonreporting of occupational accidents were nonexposure to blood (OR=4.0; CI 95%: 1.7-10.0) and the fact that the students considered the exposure to be minor or of low risk (OR=8.8; CI 95%: 3.5-23.0) or considered the protocol adopted by the institution to be inadequate (OR=5.2; CI 95%: 1.2-17.1).

Instead we here solve the former equation anew and make the case that it reduces straightforward to a particular form of the generalized real hypergeometric equation whose solutions are referred to in the mathematics literature as the finite Romanovski polynomials, in reference to the observation that for any parameter set only a finite number of such polynomials appear to be orthogonal. This is a qualitatively new integral property that does not copy any of the features of the Jacobi polynomials. In this manner, the finite number of bound states within the hyperbolic Scarf potential is brought into correspondence with a finite system of a new class of orthogonal polynomials. This work adds a new example to the circle of the problems on the Schrödinger equation. The techniques used by us extend the teachings on the Sturm-Liouville theory of ordinary differential equations beyond their standard presentation in the textbooks on mathematical methods in physics.","Romanovski polynomials; Scarf potentials; Schrodinger equation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54749113019

More precisely, the main subject of this paper is to present the analysis of bifurcations in dynamical systems through the use of symbolic computation. The necessary conditions for the occurrence of Hopf, saddle-node, transcritical or pitchfork bifurcations in first order state space nonlinear equations depending upon a vector of parameters are expressed in terms of symbolic computation. With symbolic computation, the relationship between the state variables and the parameters that play a crucial role in the occurrence of such phenomena can be established. Firstly, the symbolic computation is applied to a third order dynamic Lorenz system in order to familiarise the students with the technique. Then, the symbolic routines are used in the analysis of the simplified model of a power system, bringing new insights and a deeper understanding about the occurrence of these phenomena in physical systems.","Bifurcation parameters; Nonlinear system analysis; Power systems; Symbolic computation","Bifurcation (mathematics); Dynamical systems; Electrical engineering; Nonlinear systems; Parameter estimation; Equations of state; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear equations; Standby power systems; Vector spaces; Pitchfork bifurcations; Symbolic computation; Bifurcation parameter; Lorenz system; Physical systems; Pitch-fork bifurcations; State variables; Transcritical; Undergraduate Courses; Computation theory; Parameter estimation",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749116478

Nevertheless, the development of technologies for teaching academic skills to this population is necessary, mainly in the context of Brazilian school inclusion. People with autism are being included with greater frequency in regular classes and, consequently, need adequate strategies to learn academic contents for their entrance, permanence and progress in the schools. Many studies describe characteristics and difficulties that people with autism have, which can influence the way they learn. These variables need to be considered when planning appropriate teaching strategies for this population. Among these variables are the ways in which these individuals respond to environmental stimuli, the way they think and their typical behaviors. This study describes strategies for teaching addition and subtraction to an adolescent with autism. These teaching procedures were elaborated based on the general characteristics of autism, principles derived from Applied Behavior Analysis, and the repertoire of the participant.

These concepts are often invoked by policy analysts, policy-makers, government officials and scholars in order to justify or critique resource allocation to different levels of the educational system. Purpose By creating a new equality-equity goal-oriented model, which allows the combination of different dimensions for each concept with different stages of the educational process, this paper aims to achieve two purposes: (1) to clarify among researchers, educators, evaluators, policy analysts, and policy-makers the notions of 'equality' and 'equity'; and (2) to encourage researchers and evaluators to critically examine and synthesize equality/equity-based research. Sources of evidence A review of the literature concerning the meaning, goals and assumptions of the concepts 'equity' and 'equality', and their implications for social and public policy, is presented. Main argument A survey of recent and earlier debates on 'equity' and 'equality' among scholars and researchers reveals disagreement and confusion about what those concepts really mean and what they involve in terms of goals and results. It is debatable whether we can have 'equity' and 'equality' in a society that prioritizes efficiency in resource management over social justice. Certainly, such questions have shaped and guided many discussions and theoretical debates among scholars, policy analysts and policy-makers. Conclusions Most of the definitions of 'equity' and 'equality' are frequently used by many researchers, evaluators, policy-makers, policy analysts, scholars and educators as if they were interchangeable. Instead of arguing for a unique or simple conception of 'equity' and 'equality', a set of definitions of those concepts as well as a discussion related to theoretical and policy issues associated are presented. In order to avoid that confusion, the equality-equity model developed in this paper suggests several new directions for analysis and research. It provides some ideas about how 'equity' (i.e. 'equity for equal needs', 'equity for equal potential' and 'equity for equal achievement') and 'equality' (i.e. 'equality of opportunity', 'equality for all' and 'equality on average across social groups') could be treated and measured in future research in relation to different features of the educational process (availability of resources, access, survival, output and outcome).","Critical theory; Equality; Equity; Excellence; Goal; Model",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248987844

It argues that this privatization process is full of meanders and does not accept simple answers because it is established by forces that sometimes stimulate the growth of the public sector, sometimes that of the private sector and sometime that of both. To support this argument, it explores both the federal legislation on incentives to private institutions passed these last four decades and the statistics on students in the three levels of education. The author highlights the fact that the increase in the number of secondary public school students generates a new quality that demands a new curriculum. The paper concludes that the meandering character of such frontiers demonstrates, on the one hand, a crisis of hegemony with regard to the nature of the republican State and, on the other, the hampering of a type of quality that is missing in Brazilian education: a clear distinction between the public and private spheres in its institutional and curricular dimensions.","Brazilian education; Privatization; Public policies",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248951631

To estimate the true effects of part-time work on school grades, the authors included family background, students' educational aspirations, and school engagement as controls. Although a substantial literature exists on the relationship of part-time work and school achievement, the findings are inconsistent. The authors hypothesized that work intensity, as measured by number of work hours per week during the school year, would produce a negative effect on achievement. Results indicate that work hours do have a negative relationship with students' self-reported grades after controlling for family background, educational aspirations, and school-engagement.

The research was carried out in the Federal University of Piauí, specifically on the Teresina Campus. The universe was composed of 473 docentes who were holders of masters or doctoral degrees. The sample for interviews and the application of a questionnaire was comprised of 40 docentes belonging to six different teaching centers. 80% of these docentes had teaching experiences ranging from 16 to 26 years. The data collected during the research was examined using the theoretic model for content analysis suggested by Laurence Bardin. The results showed that: (i) the Federal University of Piauí has an organizational structure that resembles other brazilian universities; (ii) it has adopted a policy consistent with teaching qualifications directed towards; (iii) the learning assessment of the students only demands some institutional norms for the assessment to be carried out, the choice of assessment methods is left to the docentes; (iv) the docente who has obtained a masters or doctoral degree is not necessarily competent to teach at university level; (v) the articulation between teaching at graduate level and research occurs from the development of projects elaborated by monitors, those beginning research, extension courses and orientation from the demanded for the conclusion of the course; (vi) 20% of the docentes holding masters or doctoral degrees have directed their activities more towards research, 65% are more dedicated to teaching than research, while 15% elaborate extension courses; (vii) the greatest obstacles felt by those returning from post-graduation courses to the Federal University of Piauí was to awaken students for research and make research contents available in a language that was not above the ability of the students to understand; (viii) the necessity for pedagogical training is recognized; (ix) 56% of the students of the docentes interviewed showed that they were satisfied with the assessment method used by the docente, the remainder suggested that the methods be reexamined as they were not contemporary models; (x) the docentes regarded the following themes as valid as sources of reference for learning assessment and teaching formation: administration of pedagogical work; administrating new educational paradigms; assessment - a policy instrument for pedagogical work; teaching planning; knowledge for learning assessment; assessment from a knowledge construction perspective; learning conceptions as a basis for assessment; the use of thechnology as a didatic resourse; teaching assessment from a student perspective; routine statistics for a metric analysis of an examination. By way of conclusion we tried to elaborate from the results, obtained suggestions to make viable changes in formation policy for university teaching and consequently for bettering the quality of learning in an neffort to make the students more professionaly competent.","Assessment; Docent formation; Evaluation references; Learning; Superior education; University teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948874200

Nevertheless we perceive crisis signals also in the private school, whose performance has been falling in the last years, especially in 2005. What most calls our attention is that this decadence is greater in more developed regions and in mathematics. We suggest that the main reason would be instruccionism in both systems, since they share the same educational politics and the same teachers. The greater difference is possibly that private school is managed by private initiative with market and parents pressure: it follows that its performance, although not acceptable, is higher. We also suggest that the most promising initiative to overcome this predicament would be to bet on teacher, caring systematically of his permanent formation, within the premise that, if the teacher learns well, the student could do it as well.","Instruccionism; Learning; Private school; Public school; Teacher",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948841436

Under this assumption, the optimal allocation that maximizes the auctioneer's revenue can be found using a greedy-based procedure. This article argues that situations may arise where a bidder may need to express her preferences through a nondecreasing demand function; when such a bidder is present in the auction, the greedy-based procedure does not guarantee the optimal allocation. Thus, this article proposes a mixed integer program that finds the optimal allocation in a divisible-object auction at which bidders submit their bids as arbitrary stepwise demand functions. The practical aspect of the mathematical program is presented by means of a simple yet illustrative example in a treasury bond auction setting. The results of the auctioneer's revenue are reported as a function of the number of bidders with nonincreasing and nondecreasing demand functions.",,"Functions; Integer programming; Resource allocation; Divisible-object auction; Treasury bond auction; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250218207

This situation has been detected in previous research for the case of field lines: many college students assign material properties to the lines and describe them, for example, as tubes that contain or transport charges. The historical evolution of this concept shows that early scientists like Faraday assigned material properties to these lines in some occasions. In the present work a history-based instructional material was designed to foster the analysis of the ontology of field lines to help students at an Argentinean university achieve conceptual change. The predicates used by the students to describe physical situations were used as evidence of the assigned ontological status. Conceptual change was measured by the change in the proportion of geometrical predicates that students used when referring to the lines in a written questionnaire. This change was significantly higher for the students learning with the history-based material compared to those that learned in the regular class. Some characteristics of the material and geometrical ideas that students hold about the field lines were determined through an oral interview. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Distance education; Education; Learning systems; Students; Conceptual change; Material properties; To-be-learned concept; Natural sciences computing",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846598896

This program included environmental classes based on selected thematic videos and educational booklets, creative ""marine"" workshops, art competitions, guided visits to the Museo de Delfines' in Pucusana and other public events. Approximately 1,920 and 2,135 pupils attended at least one environmental class in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Between September 1997 and February 2000, nearly 1,700 children visited the museum. Five hundred and twenty-three children from Pucusana and Cerro Azul participated in workshops in 1998. In 1999, this number increased to 579 for Pucusana alone. In May 2001, personal interviews were conducted with 55 children in the sixth grade of a primary school in Pucusana to evaluate their knowledge on the conservation themes tackled during the classes. A mean of 77% (min. 40%- max. 98%) of the pupils answered correctly 16 questions on the basic biology of aquatic animals and their environment. The material displayed in the museum was well to very well remembered by 87.3% of the children. Forty-nine (89.1%) of those pupils thought that it is necessary to protect aquatic animals and 54 of them (98.2%) wished to receive more environmental classes and to visit the museum again. Children and adolescents from Pucusana and Cerro Azul, the villages where the program has run for the longest period, displayed an increasing interest, knowledge, and awareness for cetaceans and other protected marine species. The same tendency was noted in the more recently visited fishing towns of Chancay and Chimbote.

We also present the results of an investigation into the quality of the Mexican translation of the TIMSS-1995 into the Spanish language. We identified translation errors in a significant percentage of the items, as well as relatively high correlations between the severity of translation errors and the items' p-values. These findings indicate that our error-coding system is highly sensitive to test-translation error. The results underscore the need for improved translation and translation-review procedures in international comparisons. In our opinion, to implement the guidelines properly for test translation in international comparisons, each participating country needs to have internal procedures that would ensure a rigorous review of its own translations. The article concludes with four recommendations for countries participating in international comparisons. These recommendations relate to: (a) the characteristics of the individuals in charge of translating instruments; (b) the use of review, not simply at the end of the process, but during the process of test translation; (c) the minimum time needed for various translation review iterations to take place; and (d) the need for proper documentation of the entire process of test translation.","Educational tests; International tests; PISA; Test translation; TIMSS",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892150148

The questionnaire comprised 16 items grouped into four categories (economic, professional, vocational and personal background). Students rated the importance of each item for selecting dentistry as a career on a Likert-type scale of five points. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups and item scores by gender. A male/female proportion of 1/2.1 was found in the pool of participating students. When group and item scores were compared between genders, statistically significant differences were only found for vocational and personal background reasons (P < 0.05); however, the three reasons that obtained higher scores for each gender were found to be different.

Information was derived from a 124-item questionnaire which included 14 socio-demographic items and 29 items asking about ICT use. ICT items were derived from a University of Birmingham, UK, battery. Data was collected in July and August 2004. A total of 162 of the 249 dental students participated in the study. The average age of students was 21.0 years (SD 2.4 years). The majority of participants (62.1%) were female. All participants had access to a computer, and 96.4% used the Internet. Most students had home Internet connections (73.4%). The most commonly used Internet sites on at least a weekly basis were: email (92.2%); and search engines (88.3%). However, a very few (21.1%) used the Internet to search for dental information for their studies on at least a weekly basis. Furthermore, although the majority (70.4%) found Internet use easy/very easy, 56.2% indicated that any search for information was easy/very easy. The majority (72.2%) indicated that the use of virtual education would not affect their class attendance. The final multivariate model explained 26% of the variance in ICT use, significant predictors for ICT use were gender, year of study, level of difficulty in using Internet, and place of Internet use. However, Internet use was mostly for non-dental purposes. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.","Computer literacy; Dental education; Dental students; Internet","adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; Chile; dental education; dental student; epidemiology; female; human; Internet; male; methodology; psychological aspect; sex ratio; statistics; utilization review; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Chile; Education, Dental; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Sex Distribution; Students, Dental",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748110293

Despite its importance, and the fact that it is taught in technical and college courses, as well as in companies' training sectors, SQC has been largely misused. An inappropriate teaching approach may be the cause of such problem; therefore it has motivated the development of a model for SQC teaching, allowing its learners to correctly apply SQC techniques. After a survey regarding the concept needed to correctly apply SQC, its use and teaching/training methods, the model's contents and methodology were defined. We also realized the opportunity of incorporating a computer environment for the model, permitting the practice of the needed SQC concepts and skills.

These difficulties were examined in the light of Johnson-Laird's mental models. The main reason of such difficulties would be the fact that students were not able to construct mental models and, even less, assimilation schemes, that would provide some meanings to the law and to the involved concepts. Possibly, the instruction (classes and textbook) they got was not appropriate to help them in the construction of these models and schemes.

Experiment 1 found that participants show a strong effect of trial order when a stimulus was sequentially paired with two different outcomes compared to a condition where both outcomes were presented intermixed. Experiment 2 found that a 48-h retention interval eliminates the trial order effect, so that participants gave a global judgment about the relationship between the stimulus and the two outcomes equivalent to the one given by participants that received the two phases intermixed. This result was replicated in Experiment 3 in a situation in which the probability of the outcome in the presence of the cue was changed from .5 for both outcomes (Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5) to .75 and .25 for outcomes 1 and 2, respectively. Experiment 4 found that retention intervals ranging from 45 min to 48 h eliminated the trial order effect similarly. Experiment 5 found that a 10-min retention interval replicated the effect of time upon sequential training found in precedent experiments, regardless of whether participants remained within the laboratory during the retention interval or spent it outside. The combined results of this experimental series suggest that retention intervals reduce retroactive interference in causal learning by allowing participants to use all the information presented across phases, rather than differentially increasing or decreasing retrieval of information about each of them. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed and compared the quality of children's interactional strategies when jointly working on a reasoning task and a psycholinguistic task. The latter involved writing an integrated summary of three related texts. Sixth grade primary school children (11-12 years old) solved these two tasks as pre- and post-tests before and after training in the use of 'Exploratory Talk' (ET) to think together and argue as well as in strategies for producing summaries. After training, children improved substantially in the use of ET when solving the reasoning but not the psycholinguistic task. However, using ethnography of communication methods to analyse the talk further around the latter task revealed that both the number and quality of communicative events and acts increased importantly. These changes were accompanied by a significant improvement in the quality of the summaries produced. These findings suggest that the requirement for explicit reasoning in the definition and analysis of ET may be task dependent. To account for the common features of the educationally productive talk in the two settings, we propose the more inclusive concept of co-constructive talk to characterise the inter-subjective orientation, social ground rules and communicative actions that support effective collaboration, co-ordination and creativity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of the federal government would be to provide additional finance to those state funds whose value per enrolment would not reach the minimum national value, in order to guarantee a minimum standard of quality. This text emphasizes some of the deficiencies of both funds. One is that they provide very few new resources to the educational system as a whole, since the federal contribution (which would constitute these new resources) was insignificant with FUNDEF and will not be significant with FUNDEB. Another deficiency is that some governments get more than they contribute while others get less, which means that only governments gaining and/or receiving the federal contribution have more chances to maintain and develop education and to valorize their teaching staff. © 2007 CEDES.","Education funding; FUNDEB; FUNDEF",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845912949

The data analysis was based on integration between some aspects of Polanyi's theory on tacit knowledge and Ernest's model of mathematical knowledge, with reference to its mainly explicit and mainly tacit components. This integration has involved not only the types of knowledge - mainly explicit or mainly tacit - the students used in a psychological way to perform a mathematical task involving conversation, but also and particularly how much the projection of those types of knowledge on the task were manifest tacitly or formalized by the students. Among the results of the research, a strong finding was that the lack of correspondence between the students' utterances and their original understandings is directly related to the manner in which the tacit co-operates with the explicit in the process of articulation. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2006.","Mathematical knowledge; Mathematical thought and speech; Mathematics learning; Tacit knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749378265

Despite the fact that young children in Brazil have been traditionally looked after by family members, the number of parents looking for quality day care centers is growing rapidly. Therefore, having groups of babies and toddlers attending such centers from a very early age has proved to be a topic worth studying. Many disciplines have emphasized that context is an important aspect to consider, since it has a great impact on development. Assessing the quallty of the environment prepared for young children in Brazil is, consequently, of utmost importance. This study intended to assess all day care centers in a small town in the southern of Brazil (a total of 12 classrooms), employing lters-R scale, which were translated into Portuguese and tested. Findings indicate that Activities and Personal Care items had the lower medium score of all institutions; Interaction and Parents and Team had the higher one. Of all the groups, the 3 years old had been the one that presented the worse results. The use of this instrument promotes productive discussions about the quality of environment for small children.","Child development; Day nurseries; Early childhood education; Evaluation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846500655

This article reports the results of an extended collaborative action research project in which teachers attempted to create the conditions for such dialogue by adopting an inquiry approach to the curriculum. A quantitative comparison between observations made early and late in the teachers' involvement in the project showed a number of significant changes in the characteristics of teacher-whole-class discourse, with a shift toward a more dialogic mode of interaction. Nevertheless, the initiation-response-follow-up (IRF) genre continued to be pervasive. Despite this, when the same observations were examined qualitatively, there was clear evidence of an increase over time in the teachers' adoption of a ""dialogic stance."" The article concludes with a consideration of the relationship between the choice of discourse formats and the enactment of a dialogic stance.

Design/methodology/approach - Two workshops about breastfeeding and on the view of the human being as a mammal were carried out in schools in Brazil. Children were invited to express their views of breastfeeding based on what they had learned. Questionnaires were applied immediately before and 15 days after the workshops to assess the impact on children's knowledge. Findings - There was on average a low level of knowledge about breastfeeding previous to the interventions. The interventions increased children's self-perception as mammals, and managed to enhance their knowledge about several important issues regarding breastfeeding. Research limitations/implications - There was a fairly small number of participants and a restricted age range. More studies with other age ranges are warranted. Practical implications - Educative interventions on breastfeeding targeting young school children can have very positive results, suggesting that school could successfully include breastfeeding. Originality/value - This is the first study to demonstrate the impact of this innovative approach on school children's awareness on breastfeeding and it demonstrates this pedagogic approach to be effective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brazil; Children (age groups); Education; Schools",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745655394

The results in all cases suggest very poor learning. A similar situation is found in many developing countries. In this study, we analyzed the opportunities to learn (OTL) mathematics of sixth grade students from 22 public schools in Lima, Peru. OTL were defined in this study as curriculum coverage, cognitive demand of the tasks posed to the students, percent of mathematical exercises that were correct and quality of feedback. These variables were coded in the workbooks and notebooks of the students, which were gathered at the end of the school year (at the same time, the mathematics achievement test was administered). The results show that: (a) regarding OTL, less than half of the exercises available in the workbooks were solved, teachers overemphasize some topics of the national curriculum ({i.e.} related to Number and Number Sense), they pose tasks that are at very low levels of cognitive demand, and it is common to find mistakes in the students' answers to problems that have no feedback (or even worse, the feedback is wrong); (b) students in relatively poorer, multigrade classrooms have less OTL; (c) OTL, as defined earlier, is positively associated with achievement. © Springer 2006.","Achievement in mathematics; Cognitive demand; Curriculum coverage; Feedback; Opportunities to learn; Peru",,"Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA; International Development Research Centre, IDRC","We wish to thank the Ministry of Education of Peru and the Consortium for Social and Economic Research (CIES) in Lima for their support to carry out this study; CIES is supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

This is particularly important during the acquisition period because phonological recoding skills are determinant in the elaboration of orthographic representations. First graders wrote seven-letter bi-syllabic words on a digitiser. We measured movement duration and fluency and evaluated reading performance. In Experiment 1, the words varied in number of graphemes and grapheme structure. In Experiment 2, the words varied in graphemic structure but the number of graphemes was held constant. The results revealed that the children wrote the first syllable of the words grapheme-by-grapheme, irrespective of the number of letters that composed them. They prepared the movement to produce the first grapheme before starting to write. The following graphemes were processed on-line. They then prepared the movement to write the second syllable. The progressive decrease of duration and dysfluency values towards the end of the word indicates that the children prepared the entire syllable in advance. Movement time and dysfluency measures presented very similar patterns in the two experiments. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between reading performance and handwriting measures. The grapheme and syllable structure of the words therefore modulates the timing of motor production during handwriting acquisition. Once the children have learned the phonological recoding rules, they apply them systematically, irrespectively of the size of the graphemes they have to write. © Springer 2006.","Children; Duration; Dysfluency; French; Graphemes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644903759

This paper intends to provide at least a tentative assessment of how does this set of assumptions fare in the real world of clinical care. The methodology was based on direct observation of medical consultations and independent evaluation by referees of data from of medical records. The review of the data shows a far more contingent relationship between handbook prescribed procedures and actual medical practice, even though the referees evaluated the reported data mostly with favorable scores. Furthermore, a few problems were observed relating to the inadequacy of the so-called biomedical model in dealing with some of the more prevalent health problems. The authors conclude that, more than any ""technical inadequacies"", it would seem that this study has underlined the limitations of the biomedical model in responding to the tasks it attributes to itself, an issue that has to be addressed more effectively by medical education, be it in terms of undergraduate or graduate schooling. © Springer 2006.","Medical residency training; Primary care; Quality assessment; Standards of medical practice","ambulatory care; Brazil; clinical practice; education; empirical research; evidence based medicine; health care quality; human; methodology; primary health care; review; standard; theoretical model; Ambulatory Care; Brazil; Empirical Research; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Physician's Practice Patterns; Primary Health Care; Quality of Health Care","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work was made possible by grants from Brazil’s National Research Council – CNPq – and the Brazilian Education Ministry’s Committee for the Development of Human Resources – CAPES.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645471114

However, there is no clear consensus on how to evaluate these new technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for estimating the value of a new educational technology in three steps: benefit analysis, through the administration of a well-designed experiment; cost analysis, which incorporates costs to weigh against the benefits; and feasibility analysis, which introduces real-world concerns that may affect the ability to actually implement the technology. To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is used where portable educational video games were introduced into first and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in mathematics and language.

Comparing the Brazilian experience with that of other projects, the paper identifies a number of decisions which determined the process-based nature of the project structure. These were crucial in ensuring a flexible and responsive administrative structure and enabled participants to feel 'ownership' of the project.

One of the most interesting current features of physics is the increasing importance of multidisciplinary studies. Methods and ideas from physics are being applied to diverse areas of science ranging from biology and economics to sociology and linguistics. Statistical Physics (SP) provides the most fertile set of methods for these kind of applications. The aim of the present contribution is to show how a powerful idea from SP that is widely applied in many fields, the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt), can be integrated into the physics curriculum. First of all, the constrained maximization of an entropic measure provides an important illustration of the Lagrange multipliers technique, which is part of the standard calculus course for physics students. Secondly, MaxEnt provides the basis for an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics, which is nowadays being considered in some modern textbooks on SP. In point of fact, the main role usually assigned to MaxEnt (as a tool for teaching theoretical physics) is in connection with the Gibbs canonical and grand canonical ensembles. However, as we shall here explain, MaxEnt also constitutes a useful tool in the teaching of other aspects of theoretical physics: it provides an elegant and simple method for obtaining analytical solutions for several evolution equations, like the Liouville equation, the diffusion equation, and the Fokker-Planck equation. Last but certainly not least, MaxEnt belongs to the tool-kit that physicist use to solve concrete ""real-world"" problems.","Continuity equations; Liouville equation; Maximum entropy principle",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448991585

A method for calculating the error of the approximation and its use in determining the restricted domain is described and is fully developed up to the third order. In addition, five examples are presented where the inversion of a polynomial is applied in solving different problems encountered in basic courses on physics and mathematics.

Most graduates from our medical school eventually become GPs, so they must be trained in a number of basic skills in obstetrics and gynaecology. Aims: To introduce the use of medical simulators in undergraduate courses of obstetrics and gynaecology. Methodology: During the gynaecology course in the 2003 academic year, students were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group did their training with medical simulators. Their learning was followed up using a checklist for pelvic examination. Results: The results show that the students that did their training with simulators had more opportunities to perform the manoeuvres, especially those involving greater difficulty like vaginal examination and "" speculum"" introduction. Conclusions: The use of medical simulators constitutes a good tool for the acquisition of skills in the obgyn area.

Annually, 5,000 physicians graduate from these programs. Admission requirements vary depending on each university's policy. Some do not have entry requirements; others require a course, usually on the basics of mathematics, biology, chemistry or physics, and some introduction to social and humanistic studies. Each year, there are approximately 12,000 first-year medical students attending the 29 schools, which suffer a high dropout rate during the first years because of vocational problems or inability to adapt to university life. Some schools have massive classes (over 2,000 students), which makes it difficult for the schools to perfect their teaching. The number of full-time faculty members is low, and some of them have appointments at more than one medical school. Residency programs offer an insufficient number of places, and fewer than 50% of the graduates can obtain a residency position because of strict admission requirements. Coordination between the Ministry of Health, representing the health care system, and the Ministry of Education, representing the medical education system, needs to be improved. Despite the problems of medical education in Argentina, the movement to improve the education of health care workers is growing.

Duplicatlon of the number of places and reservation of 50% of the places for applicants from public schools do not change this ethnical and racial profile, thus indicating that skin-color sensitive policies must be adopted in order to increase the rate of black students attending public universities and to contribute to the reduction of racial inequalities in Brazil.

Both were accomplished in a scenario built with 10 volunteer students taking calculus in a Computer Engineering course in 2003. Among the main results we emphasise the academic maturing process for the student, how competent he gets in making models, accomplishing simulations, his perception of the relation between mathematical learning and everyday situations and political reflection about the results from working with modelling as much as about his participation in the community work. © The Author 2005.

Previous research brought to light the multidimensional structure of reflective practice in medicine. It comprises at least five sets of behaviours in response to complex medical problems encountered in professional practice. Factors associated to reflective practice among physicians have, as far as we know, not yet been explored by empirical study. Purpose: To study factors correlated to reflective practice among physicians. Methods: A questionnaire exploring characteristics of professional practice and educational experiences was administered to primary health care physicians. Measurements were related to scores on a reflective practice measuring instrument developed previously. Associations between variables were examined by statistical analysis with tests of correlation and analysis of variance. Results: Reflective practice is negatively correlated to physician's age and number of years of clinical practice. Working mainly in hospitals and attendance to medical residency programmes in some specialties apparently have a positive effect on reflective practice. Conclusion: Reflective practice tends to decrease with experience. Findings are consistent with the literature on medical expertise that shows a decline of analytical reasoning in proportion to the increase in experience. Some specialty programmes seems to enhance concerns with the scientific basis to professional practice, thereby favouring reflective approaches. Local features of primary health care settings probably explain their negative effect on reflective practice. Strategies to develop reflective practice among physicians should be explored by further research. © Springer 2005.","Clinical reasoning; Critical thinking; Medical education; Medical expertise; Reflective practice","adult; article; Brazil; female; general practice; human; male; physician; professional competence; psychological aspect; questionnaire; thinking; Adult; Brazil; Family Practice; Female; Humans; Male; Physicians; Professional Competence; Questionnaires; Thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29144480495

Findings indicate that prospective teachers initially demonstrated alternative understandings of evolutionary concepts; there were uninformed understandings of the nature of scientific inquiry; there was little correlation between understandings and disciplines; and even the prospective teachers with research experience failed to understand the diverse methods used by scientists.

The work devoted to excellence and deep learning by several authors has been carefully followed and considered. This communication reports research work on chemistry teaching, associated with those developments for first-year students. The work included the design of strategies and the adoption of teaching and learning activities exploring ways to stimulate active learning by improving the quality of classroom interactions. In addition to regular lectures, large classes' teaching based on student-generated questions was explored. In order to improve students' motivation and stimulate their curiosity, conference-lectures were adopted to deal with selected topics of wide scientific, technological and social interest. Quantitative analysis and discussion of selected case studies, together with the organization of laboratory classes based on selected enquiry-based experiments, planned and executed by students, stimulated deep learning processes.

The article departs from a hypothetical question an academic asks him/herself in his way to the educational institution where he-she works: What is my university? What makes me change from enthusiasm to deception, from pain to happiness? The answers give place to a personal dialogue, which brings the awareness that education overflows from the windows and doors of the classroom, to reach those distant places that Juvenal defined as ""ultra Auroram et Gangem"" (beyond the rising sun and the Ganges), and that Latin Americans could translate to ""beyond the Trópico and the Amazonas."" In short, to reach the consciousness that our educational work comprehends a larger territory than the one constrained to the limited geography of a site or an institution. In this broad realm, there are diverse attributes we have to create or recreate: hope, opportunity, imagination, and therefore be able to exercise our capacity to relate, to refer, to reflect.

This debate follows two other instances of work: (1) the adidactic interaction between each student and a given problem, (2) the adidactic interaction of each student with the procedures generated by other students during stage 1. The two kinds of processes - adaptation to a milieu and social interactions - play a critical role in the change of ""rationality"" required for the move from arithmetic to algebra. Both the design of the initial mathematical problem given to the students and the organization of the interactions leading to the debate under study in this article are based on this hypothesis. The research presented in this article is set in a broader work of didactic engineering that aims at studying didactic conditions for making a connection between arithmetic practices and algebraic practices. © Springer 2005.","Interaction with procedures of peers; Milieu as generator of new questions; Theory of didactic situations; Transition from arithmetic to algebra",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044526870

The study applies multilevel linear modeling on the levels of student, school and state. It finds a close relationship between achievement in Mathematics and the variables of school composition and schooling processes. It shows that when both variables act together, the effect of all other variables significantly decreases. The variables of schooling processes, however, even when diminished in influence, nonetheless notably continue to affect students' achievements.

The design was based on the assumption that the scientific notion of periodic function is related with the social practice of prediction. In the situation, prediction as a social practice is transformed into a situational line of argument which redefines that which is periodical. The situation brings into play meanings for the repetition of a movement, which takes place in time in the context of graphs of functions. Our analysis of the situation will focus on the prediction tools that participants generated in order to define that which is periodical.

The application of Factorial Correspondence Analysis showed that mathematical education was the most important variable for the understanding of this concept, followed by educational level. Most first year students and Sports students did not accept infinite collections; in some cases they identified infinity with the notion of a lot. Instead, advanced and Mathematics students accepted infinite collections and distinguished them from everything. Overall, the distinction between infinity and everything posed the most difficult challenge for students in different conditions. We argue that semiotic processes of suspension and redescription are involved in learning mathematical infinity, requiring in this case the participation in educational contexts favouring a high degree of mathematical reflection and explicitation.

The present research examined the extent to which first- to third-grade children observed an adult's demonstration of how to fold origami figures or observed the folding of two slightly older children who also were trying to make the figures, without requesting further information. In the primary analysis, 10 Mexican heritage US children observed without requesting additional information to a greater extent than 10 European heritage US children. Consistent with the ethnographic literature, these two groups differed in the extent of their family's involvement in schooling; hence, we explored the relationship with maternal schooling in a secondary analysis. An additional 11 children of Mexican heritage whose mothers had extensive experience in formal school (at least a high school education) showed a pattern more like that of the European heritage children, whose mothers likewise had extensive experience in school, compared with the Mexican heritage children whose mothers had only basic schooling (an average of 7.7 grades). The results suggest that a constellation of cultural traditions that organise children's learning experiences - including Western schooling - may play an important role in children's learning through observation and explanation. © 2005 The International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development.",,"article; boy; Caucasian; child; community; controlled study; cultural factor; education; ethnology; experience; family; female; girl; Hispanic; human; learning; male; mother; observation; reliability; school; sibling; task performance; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044510417

The historical reconstruction of the periodic table showed that the periodicity of the elements could be construed as an inductive generalization or as a function of the atomic theory. There is considerable controversy with respect to the nature of Mendeleev's contribution, and various alternatives are discussed: ordered domain; empirical law; and a theory with limited explanatory power. Accommodation of the elements according to their physicochemical properties is considered to be the major contribution of the periodic table by all textbooks, followed by contra-predictions of previously unknown elements (30 textbooks), and novel predictions (corrections of atomic mass) of known elements (10 textbooks). The relative importance of accommodation and prediction within an HPS framework is generally ignored. Few textbooks have attempted to explore the possible cause of periodicity in the table and very few textbooks have explored the nature of Mendeleev's contribution. The development of the periodic table as a sequence of heuristic principles in the form of a convincing argument has been ignored. The textbook approach of emphasizing that the development of the periodic table was an inductive generalization, and that Mendeleev had no model or theory, does not facilitate the spirit of critical inquiry that led the scientists to grapple with alternative interpretations, conflicts, and controversies. It is concluded that the development of the periodic table went through a continual critical appraisal (conflict and controversy), in which scientists presented various tentative theoretical ideas to understand the observed phenomena. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Electrons; Heuristic methods; Mathematical models; Philosophical aspects; Physical chemistry; Societies and institutions; Textbooks; Atomic theory; Chemistry textbooks; History and philosophy of science (HPS); Periodic table; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444255188

The authors studied whether program violations of the CPRs regarding residents' duty hours, time for educational activities, and faculty supervision adversely affected residents' perceptions about the quality of their lives and about the educational environment. Method: From October through December 2003, 88 residents from four institutions in Florianópolis (SC), Brazil were invited to participate of the study. Residents completed four instruments: a questionnaire about their program's compliance with CPRs; the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM) that assesses perceptions about the learning environment; the Quality of School Life Scale (QSL), which assesses the quality of life at school; and the WHO Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL), which assesses the general quality of life. Residents were categorized according to gender, institution, year of training, specialty, and their answers on the CPRs questionnaire. DREEM, SQL, and WHOQOL scores were compared between categories. Results: A total of 62 residents (70%) responded. A significant number of residents reported their program's noncompliance with CPRs. Residents reporting program compliance rated higher parameters of general quality of life, quality of life in residency, and the educational environment. Conclusion: Violations of Brazil's residency program CPRs are associated with residents' worse perceptions of several aspects of general quality of life, quality of life in residency, and the educational environment.",,"article; Brazil; health care organization; health program; human; learning; medical ethics; perception; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; residency education; resident; work schedule",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344279656

In Latin American countries, like in long-established democracies, a larger number of policy analysts and government's officers are concerned with the practical use of knowledge. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by identifying some political and organizational factors that could serve as a basis for the development of a comprehensive framework of analysis. Firstly, it discusses some theoretical perspectives in regard to the study of the linkage between knowledge and public policy. Then, it describes the preferred approach to assess how ideas can shape policy-making. It outlines Mexican politics, stressing the difficulties that policy scholars may face to make their intellectual function more practical. It was found that specialists have gained a position to influence Mexico's educational policies and this constitute a remarkable experience in Latin America and, furthermore, opens up the opportunity for embarking on deeper analyses. © 2010 Instituto de Investigaciones sobre la Universidad y la Educación, UNAM.","Education policy; Knowledge; Policy networks; Specialists",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649267512

Experimental results involving a dc motor with shaft speed saturation are presented to illustrate the inadequacy of the simple saturation model and to validate the proposed simulation scheme. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Control nonlinearities; Control system analysis; DC motors; Engineering education; Mathematical models; State space methods; Transfer functions; Dynamic systems; Output saturation; Saturation block; Nonlinear control systems","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Manuscript received September 30, 2002; revised August 20, 2003.

Rural students are one of the groups that represent an important challenge, because they often speak an indigenous language and study in classrooms that combine a wide variety of ages and grades under a single teacher. This study used a longitudinal design to follow a group of students in 20 public schools in two rural areas. The first measurements were carried out in 1998, when all the students where in fourth grade. Tests of reading comprehension and mathematics were administered at the end of the school year, and again in 2000. Background information included anthropometric measures, questionnaires for the students, teachers, and schools. We went back to the schools in 2001 to record the grade reached by the students. We found that 43% of the students were in high school, while 20% had dropped out; the rest had repeated a grade one or more times. Educational achievement in 2000 was best explained by achievement in 1998, but dropping out was not associated with achievement. Dropping out was associated with gender (women were more likely to drop out), age (older students were more likely to drop out), height for age (positive association) and not living with both parents. We found no in-school support programs for students that fall behind their peers or are at risk of dropping out. In a way we could describe the observed schools as ""Darwinian"" in the sense that it is expected that students will adapt to the school. The performance of students has no consequences for their teachers. In terms of policy implications, we suggest considering interventions that account for not only educational variables, but also other needs of the students and families that are served by these schools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644328683

The rationale was simple and appealing: The more local the decision, the greater the voice of the voter-consumer was supposed to be; while the larger number of suppliers was assumed to lead to greater variety. Research documented here shows that while authority and resources could be transferred downward in the system in a short amount of time, the so-called 'autonomous schools programs' failed to generate significant improvement in pupils' achievement.

The PBL curriculum brought together the contents of physics, mathematics and computer science courses into a single course. Instead of the students having to enroll in each course separately, they had the opportunity to enroll in a single course in which they learned the contents of those subjects by solving real-life engineering problems. In order to evaluate the effects of the program on the students' academic achievement, three data sources were taken: pre-test-post-test scores on two physics tests: students' grade point average (GPA); and students' grades in advanced engineering courses. With respect to the first source of data, results showed that while PBL students' improvements in scores were significantly higher than control students' improvements on the Mechanics Baseline Test, improvements were similar in both groups on the Force Concept Inventory. With regard to the second source of data, PBL students' GPA was significantly higher than control students' GPA.

This research addresses preschoolers' intuitive understanding of rectilinear movement and some variables which affect it, and the type of arguments used when related knowledge states are justified. A first working hypothesis is that the resolution of practical, functional situations would be based on self-regulation processes. A second working hypothesis is that feedback provided by the situations would modify their levels of epistemological understanding. Method. The sample is composed of 40 boys and girls between the ages of 5.0 and 5.5 years, selected randomly from three private preschool educational institutions in Cali (Colombia), and subsequently assigned to two groups. The experimental material consists of four isomorphic situations based on a task by Chen and Klahr (1999). Results. Data support the first hypothesis: the average number of actions increased significantly between sessions, strategies undertaken by the children are organized in more complex series and with greater effectiveness. Empirical support for the second hypothesis is not supported, most arguments which the children use to describe the knowledge of characters in the situation remain stable. Discussion. A self-regulation process was identified in the children's verbalizations, which moved from mentioning actions undertaken on the material to controlling actions in advance. Positions such as that of Schauble (1996) are discussed, stating that preeschoolers are hesitant to abandon strategies despite their uselessness. The activity was ineffective in transforming the arguments they use and by implication their levels of epistemological understanding. © 2004 Universidad de Almeria.","Epistemological understanding; Implicit conceptions; Inductive inference; Physics in early childhood education; Preschool; Self-regulation",,,"1 This article arises from a research effort, Inference and Epistemological Understanding: A perspective from its microgenesis, sponsored by the Research Center at the University Antonio Nariño, Santa Fe de Bogotá.

The process did not happen in isolation. Besides the Companhia de Jesus' high schools, which were extinguished, there were private colleges for the teaching of Latin, Greek and Rhetoric. Students had to pay a fee and used facilities in teachers' homes. What place did Pombal bestow to these disciplines and to the new colleges? Which models were adopted? Kenneth Maxwell, Marquês de Pombal, paradoxo do iluminismo (Rio de Janeiro, 1996), p. 96. The contents of the first step of Pombal's reform stretched from 1759 to 1769. After the closing of the colleges of the Companhia de Jesus and of Évora University, the birth of high school education started with the foundation of feeless schools of Latin, Greek and Rhetoric, in order to secure a medium level of instruction and preparation for university education. The reform included another branch of education: a School of Commerce (Lisbon), and a School of Navigation and Drawing (Porto) were founded. These schools were aimed first of all at children and grandchildren of tradespeople. Pombal also tried to meet the educational needs of the aristocracy: Nobles College (and later Mafra College) was opened. In that period, the colony of Brazil had, at the secondary level of education, some Latin and Rhetoric schools. A number of teachers were sent to Pernambuco and others were hired to cover Bahia's needs in the field. The lack of teachers, mainly of Rhetoric and Greek Grammar, was a serious problem. The implantation of reforms in the Brazilian colony was much harder than in Portugal. Schoolbooks were hardly available and the payment of teachers caused many administrative complications that produced reactions from the students' families. So the teachers used old banned schoolbooks and equally old methods. Between Portugal and the colony in Brazil sharp differences existed in the implantation of the school system and the system's structure. In spite of the intense mercantile activities of Brazilian harbours, the colony would only have a School of Commerce in 1809, while in Lisbon such an institution had already opened 50 years before. One could point to other differences. Brazil was never allowed to have a college like Nobles College. The teaching of experimental physics was never integrated in the institution. There was only one ex-Jesuit who gave classes at home. On the colleges' front, one must single out the unique case of Olinda, whose seminary was found by bishop Azeredo Coutinho, one of the most remarkable Illuminist personalities of Portugal and Brazil. In 1772 the school system was completed with the creation of Reading, Writing and Counting schools and the adoption of the disciplines of Natural Philosophy and Religion at the secondary level of education. At university level, besides the innovations made in the Faculty of Theology and in the University of Canon and Civil Law, a broad role was recognized for the teaching of experimental physics, chemistry, botanic and zoology, as well as mathematics. This was the reason for the creation of the Philosophy and Mathematics Faculties, with enough resources to guarantee a realistic education. In the Brazilian colony, teaching of a scientific orientation was undertaken through the creation of military courses. Courses of Mathematics resulted from artillery education at the end of the seventeenth century (1698) and immediately after that courses in Military Architecture were taught. In the eighteenth century, the Royal Court stimulated the creation of military courses in Brazil and other colonies. In spite of our ignorance of the results of the King's determinations, we know that military schools were founded in 1714, in Bahia, and in 1778 in Pernambuco. In this last city the Military Academy was founded, whose traces were still evident in 1812. But it was in Rio de Janeiro that this education branch was developed further, evolving later into the Royal Academy of Military Architecture and Drawing. Due to the arrival in Rio de Janeiro of Queen Maria the First and her son, the future João the Sixth, the capital went through an intense process of cultural development. In 1808 the Navy Academy was founded, with all available scientific tools, books and machines, copying the Lisbon model. It opened its first courses in 1809: mathematics, physics, artillery, navigation and drawing. This institution would eventually be substituted by the Navy School and Naval College. In 1810, the Rio de Janeiro Military Academy was instituted, which later gave rise to the Polytechnic School and the Campo Grande Shooting School. High schools were first created in Portugal in 1836. Criticizing Pombal's heritage, some people were convinced that this branch of public education was forming a group of sterile knowledge, almost useless to the science culture, and lacking material that could contribute to the progress of the country's material civilization. Therefore the curriculum in the National Plan of High Schools included scientific and humanistic subjects, as well as technical subjects. The implantation of high schools is a process that finished only around 1860. Until that date, in several places, Pombal's old isolated schools of secondary education remained alive. In Brazil the process was also painful. Only two seminary schools were active and Latin lessons were dispersed throughout the territory. Much needed was an overall plan that would consolidate this level of education. Later, the Pedro the Second College would be organized conforming with the French lycée model. But nothing stopped the old isolated courses, independent of institutions, from continuing to exist, sometimes in a brilliant way. Our conclusions are only provisional. At present, we can state that the development of high schools in Portugal and in the colony of Brazil followed a path that was a legacy from the past. After Independence, education adopted several different guidelines, which, in their turn, moulded future initiatives. © Stichting Paedagogica Historica.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"French",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071208214

Although significant differential learning gains between the experimental conditions were not observed, differences in learner behaviour between these conditions were. In particular students in the motivated condition with a weak companion taught it many more times than in the other experimental conditions and in general worked harder.

The main objective of this work is to know the degree of incidence existing between two groups of students: one, based on conference-style classes where students, guided by the teacher, have to search for information about a topic in the computer lab and present it in front of the class and, in the other, where students are taught by the teacher according to a printed text. The experimental design consisted of a pre-test/post-test plus the application of different techniques to develop the different linguistic and cognitive strategies, between these tests. The methodology used by the Experimental Group forced learners to generate their own knowledge, so they had to apply the information and work by themselves in Workshops; and the Control Group participated in the classroom according to the communicative approach, guided by the teacher in the traditional class. Statistics were applied to the scores obtained between both tests, and the scores obtained weekly in the different competences contributed to knowing whether there were significant differences between both groups. © 2004, Cambridge University Press.

This innovative program organizes human and technical resources for delivering distance education in a cost-effective manner. Different from other institutional systems - which typically employ their own dedicated content, design, and instructional resource personnel, and accompanied by a large pool of administrative staff - Proformação leverages pre-existing learning resources such as content experts, technology specialists, instruction, and student support systems from several institutions. Proformação goal is to create a viable teacher certification course to upgrade thousands of non-certified teachers working in the field. Proformação is coordinated by an administrative unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Education. To support the program, an information system was implemented to continuously and consistently monitor the program's activities and results. Results of an external evaluation have been positive; Proformação is regarded by some as an innovative model for delivering decentralized training opportunities to large student numbers. Therefore, the findings in this article may prove interesting to those charged with implementing distance learning initiatives in developing countries, in that the lessons learned in Brazil may help others interested in implementing similar distance training programs.","Distance education; Distance education in developing countries; Distance teacher training; In-service teacher training",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042529221

Both the model of linear multiple regression and the model of logistic regression predicted 77% of the cases of adoption and, therefore, represented satisfactorily the data from the questionnaire used. The variables observability and trialability were found to be the two most significant predictors of adoption. Adoption took place in 65% of the schools where pedagogical coordinators were brought under pressure by teachers to have the Internet adopted as a teaching tool, implying that this variable may influence the adoption rate.

To assess conceptions of the earth planet, a structured interview of individual application was devised. CSP was assessed using the Three Mountains Task; the construction of GRS was assessed with the Water-Level Task, and PR was assessed with the Embedded Figures Test. A qualitative analysis of the interview responses revealed five conceptions of the earth planet that were classified in three categories: conception based on apparent data from the physical environment, conceptions that articulate these data with cultural knowledge, and scientific or cultural conceptions. The children's frequency distribution in diverse conceptions shows that there is an age related knowledge development.

Using the distinction introduced by Damasio between primary and secondary emotions, and between emotions and feelings, we describe how the background feelings emerged in different ways in the two classrooms. In class B, the relationships were constructed in a friendly way from the very beginning. The positive emotions that contributed to raising positive background feelings occurred in a high number and frequency. In class A, the picture was completely different, with a higher number and frequency of negative emotions. Thus, emotions and background feelings that were constructed differently in each classroom were at the heart of the different outcomes in terms of attitudes towards chemistry that arose in the two classrooms.

Specifically, how bilingual education is defined and implemented in the private education sector in Guatemala City where the largest number of privately run establishments exist. Given the great deficits in the provision of educational coverage in the public sector, there has been an explosive expansion of private institutions which have very different levels of quality. Through an analysis of the administrative processes within the Guatemalan Government in general and its Education Ministry in particular as well as of the governance arrangements existing in the private school sector, an overall view of the curricular and policy decisions taken by private schools in the formulation and implementation of bilingual education is presented. This study was based on a sample of six private schools which cater to higher income segments of Guatemala City's student population. Some of the relevant findings of this study include, the existence of a situation of quasi autonomous institutional functioning of the private sector, extreme differentials in the quality of services provided, inadequate levels of teacher and school administrator's training as well as lack of cooperation between public and private sector schools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042560053

The study examined data of more than 130,000 students of approximately 3,300 high schools, depending on the outcome indicator considered, from the Censo Nacional de Finalización del Nivel Secundario 1998 (High School National Census of 1998). Student's math and language scores were based on standard tests applied to the students at the end of the academic year. Using multilevel linear modeling with three levels (student, school and state), the author found that (i) the relative influence of schools on cognitive achievements is much higher than on non-cognitive outcomes; (ii) there is no difference in Mathematics achievement between public and private schools once socioeconomic and cultural school composition (""peer group"") are controlled for, while private schools have a small advantage over public school in Language achievement; (iii) the most important effect of the public-private dichotomous variable is detected in relation to the distribution of student ""success expectations.""

These effects were studied using a sample of 1274 students from economically disadvantaged schools in Chile. The videogames were specifically designed to address the educational goals of the first and second years of school, for basic mathematics and reading comprehension. The sample was divided into experimental groups (EG), internal control groups (IC) and external control groups (EC). Students in the EG groups, used the experimental video games during an average of 30 h over a 3-month period. They were evaluated on their acquisition of reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematical skills, and on their motivation to use video games. Teachers' expectations of change due to the use of video games, their technological transfer, and handling of classroom dynamics, were assessed through ad hoc tests and classroom observations. The results show significant differences between the EG and IC groups in relation to the EC group in Math, Reading Comprehension and Spelling, but no significant differences in these aspects were found between the EG and the IC groups. Teacher reports and classroom observations confirm an improvement in motivation to learn, and a positive technological transfer of the experimental tool. Although further studies regarding the effects of learning through videogame use are imperative, positive effects on motivation and classroom dynamics, indicate that the introduction of educational video games can be a useful tool in promoting learning within the classroom. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,,"98-1552; 1000520, C-13595; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1980573","The study presented in this article forms part and was financed by the following research and development projects: FONDEF D9611016, FONDECYT 1980573, FONTEC 98-1552, Fundación Andes C-13595 and FONDECYT 1000520.

Data from case studies, interviews, paper-and-pencil tests, and whole-class observations were collected during field tests with 4 fourth-grade classrooms. Students had to overcome substantial hurdles in learning to spatially structure two-dimensional grids, including interpreting the grid's components as line segments rather than regions; appreciating the precision of location the lines required, rather than treating them as fuzzy boundaries or indicators of intervals; and learning to trace vertical or horizontal lines that were not axes. We found no evidence for a relationship between students' strategies for naming and locating coordinates and their other knowledge of grid and coordinate systems; instead, such knowledge was related to students' levels of competence in three aspects of more complex coordinate situations: Number sense, spatial-geometric relationships, and the ability to discriminate and integrate the two numbers constituting a coordinate pair and the two axes constituting a coordinate plane. On this basis we describe elements of students' mental structuring of grid and coordinate systems as two-dimensional spaces, demarcated and measured with conceptual rulers. Relationships between students' conceptualizations and various representations, including real-world analogies, were complex, with the real-world contexts serving an important scaffolding role for most students at the early phases of learning, but impeding further mathematical abstraction in some students at later phases. Computer representations were significant in aiding learning, especially mathematical generalization and abstraction, in both grid and coordinate systems and in the learning of concepts of rectangles. Teacher and computer scaffolding also played a critical role in helping students integrate information from within these areas and broadly between their spatial and numeric schemes.",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported by three National Science Foundation grants.

Children are now ""the kings and queens of the house"", dethroning the adults from the central place of authority within the family and even in schools. The massive entrance of women into modern culture and economy has created a new field of action for education, which is now directed to this new segment of the population, that has achieved higher degrees of cultural autonomy, compared to adults, in order to define their ways of learning and socializing.

Method: The records of 447 final year medical students were examined to provide data on the starting terms, frequency and course targets of peer tutoring activity of student tutors. The relationships of these features with their learners' characteristics, academic achievements and selective clerkship pathways were analysed. Setting: The medical education programme at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. Results: Analysis showed that about 96% of all graduates had acted as student tutors at some time during the programme, with great variation in starting terms, numbers and types of courses tutored. The average number of tutored courses per tutor was four. Frequency and variety of tutored courses were significantly related to achievement, learning style and gender. Higher achievers acted as student tutors for many terms and explored different subjects, and there is evidence that the experience expanded their academic expertise. Specific tutoring in a clinical course also related to strength of early career preference. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the number of terms of tutoring undertaken in a clinical course and the proportion of students choosing selective clerkship training in the same area by the end of programme. Conclusions: The findings suggest that acting as a peer tutor can be an appealing and constructive educational opportunity to further students' academic development.

The term ‘word’ is both a metalinguistic and an everyday term. Rules about word separation have evolved over many years and are now normative in the languages these children are trying to write: Italian, Portuguese, Spanish. Children hesitate precisely at those places where historically there was also hesitation. They probably face similar difficulties with the conceptual definition of the ‘word’. A total of 987 texts written by second- and third-grade children (7 to 9 years) were Collected in Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Mexico and Uruguay, in a large number of different schools. The children were asked to write the story of Little Red Riding Hood, well known by children in those cultures. The normative view led to a quantitative analysis of ‘deviations’ from present language orthographies to give an overall picture of the situation. The interpretative attitude aimed at understanding children’s writing and is related to a qualitative analysis of the written strings where the most of the deviations are located. Illegal segmentations in Italian and Spanish concentrate in specific graphic positions, that are similar for hypo and hyper segmentations in the two writing systems. © 2002 E. Ferreiro & C.

Statistical concepts, as well as the use of statistical methods and techniques, can be taught in at least two contrasting ways. Specifically, (1) teaching can be theoretically and mathematically oriented, or (2) it can be less mathematically oriented being focused, instead, on application and the use of data to solve real-world problems. The second approach is growing in practice and new goals have recently emerged. At present, statistics courses stress probability concepts, data analysis, and the interpretation and communication of results. Understanding the process of statistical investigation is established as a way of improving mastery of statistical reasoning. In this context, a project-based approach allows the design and implementation of participating learning scenarios in order to understand the statistical methodology and, as a consequence, improve research. This approach points out that statistics is a rational methodology used to solve practical problems. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and results of an applied statistics course for PhD students in ecology and systematics using a project-based approach. Examples involving character coding, species classification, and the interpretation of geographical variation, which are the principal systematic analyses requiring statistical techniques, are presented using the results from student projects. In addition, an example from conservation ecology is presented. Results indicate that the students understood the concepts and applied the systematic and statistical techniques accurately using a data oriented approach. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856913245

Firstly, the general aspects of the results are examined, and then they are compared on the basis of the socioeconomic level of the schools. The various groups of information collected confirm that the socioeconomic variable is the determinant factor in the results, and that the school affiliation (private, public or state funded) loses importance. When checked against the cost of school fees (direct cost), the efficiency of results favors the schools that serve the more vulnerable population. In that respect, two aspects are of relevance: first, the municipal schools are efficient to the poorer layers of the population; second, at the socioeconomic levels where there is total competence (the market works), the dependence on the school is secondary, the socioeconomic level being the dominant explaining factor. Comparison of schools by socioeconomic group and affiliation eliminates an inequality factor that has effect on the performance results: the school equipment and infrastructure, if considered in a fictitious situation (equality of basic processes), favor the better equipped schools, which incorporate funding from the parents. This casts doubt on the assertion that differences intra-socioeconomic group are due to the school management variables; the evidence is compelling when the socioeconomic level is incorporated as an explaining variable.","School efficiency school results; Social and education inequalities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247448427

It considers that since the 1980s there has been a shift in the studies about teacher education, whose emphasis on the person of the teacher has favored the publication of a large number of works about teacher's lives, careers and professional tracks, teacher's autobiographies or their personal development (Nôvoa, 1982). Seeing more than just a fashion in the approaches that have endeavored to explore aspects of teacher's subjectivity, the text seeks to understand what has been the cause of their widespread acceptance. Within this perspective, the article discusses how the human sciences since the early decades of the 20h century have broken away from conventional research methods, and attempts to show how subjectivity became the nuclear and articulating idea of the new theoretical propositions that have thenceforth sustained various fields. The text then examines the specific features of the biographical method (Ferrarotti, 1985), underlining its heuristic value to the investigation of the relations between social and individual histories. In its last part, the article introduces a characterization of the studies with teacher's life histories, highlighting the following points: the current need to build up a theory of adult education (Dominicé, 1990); the potential of such studies and approaches, and the methodological difficulties that result, on the one hand, from the great variety of uses that have been made of these approaches and, on the other hand, from the newness and immaturity of the field itself.","Autobiographical method; Life histories; Subjectivity; Teachers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846271257

The most popular design technique is the Ziegler-Nichols method, which relies solely on parameters obtained from the plant step response. However, besides being suitable only for systems with monotonic step response, the compensated systems whose controllers are tuned in accordance with the Ziegler-Nichols method have generally a step response with a high-percent overshoot. In this paper, tuning methods for proportional-integral (PI) and PID controllers are proposed that, like the Ziegler-Nichols method, need only parameters obtained from the plant step response. The methodology also encompasses the design of PID controllers for plants with underdamped step response and provides the means for a systematic adjustment of the controller gain in order to meet transient performance specifications. In addition, since all the development of the methodology relies solely on concepts introduced in a frequency-domain-based control course, the paper has also a didactic contribution.","Control education; Control system design; Process Control; Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers; Root-locus diagram","Algorithms; Gain control; Mathematical models; Process control; Two term control systems; Root-locus diagrams; Three term control systems","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 352810/96-3","Manuscript received January 2, 2002; revised February 13, 2002.

In general, it was observed that the students were not satisfied with what was being taught to them at school, for the school programme does not cover most of their interests. When asked what they did want to learn at school, the majority of students in the elementary school and in high school mentioned themes and/or activities that are not taught at school. The majority of the justifications given by the students for their preferences have a direct relation with their natural inclination, based on a subjective feeling of liking or disliking a given subject. The importance of 'vocation' on the students' career option and the difficulties they face at the time of decision when confronted, at the end of high school, with the increasing number of possibilities open to them is also a matter of discussion. Given the importance of school for the student's future life and career, it is felt that the dissatisfaction with the school programme detected in this study should be taken into account and a school programme with a new content should be considered to modify the present situation.","Career; Education; School curriculum; Student's preferences; Students' expectations",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, FAPERGS","Acknowledgements: We would like to acknowledge the help of all those who made tshi study possi, ibn parlticuelar, the students who completed the questionna.iTrhis eworks wasuppos rted in part by grnts afrom Conselho Nacional de Desenovlntvo CinmíŽicotee e Tecnoógicol(CNPq, Pro)grama de Apoio a Núcleos de Excelência (PRONEX) and by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Jaeiro n(FPERJ)A.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036623424

An experiment was carried out in which children had to order three sets of blue and pink marbles according to their degree of chance of drawing a target colour. Neither age group had received any previous instruction in probability. The task in this experiment was opened to solutions in terms of part-part or part-whole comparisons. We tested the idea that children would solve the tasks by using part-part relations to estimate probability rather than part-whole comparisons. The analysis of children's strategies and their verbal justifications revealed that children ignored the role played by the possible cases by making correct ordering on the basis of part-part relations in which they made comparisons between favourable and unfavourable cases in each set of marbles. The results support the findings reported by Spinillo and Bryant (1991, 1999) on proportional reasoning, and the idea claimed by Resnick and Singer (1993) and Singer, Kohn, and Resnick (1997) about the early intuitive origins of relational concepts termed protoquantitative schemes. The informal knowledge represented by the use of part-part comparisons plays an important role in early probabilistic thinking. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We adopt the assumption that comprehension in a particular field of physics is attained when it is possible to predict a physical phenomenon from its physical models without having to previously refer to the mathematical formalism. The physical models constitute the semantic structure of a physical theory and determine the way the classes of phenomena linked to them should be ""perceived."" Within this framework, the first step in order to understand a phenomenon or a process in physics is to construct mental models that will allow the individual to understand the statements that compose the semantic structure of the theory, being necessary, at the same time, to modify the way of perceiving the phenomena by constructing mental models that will permit him to evaluate as true or false the descriptions the theory makes of them. When this double process is attained concerning a particular phenomenon, in such a way that the ""results"" of the constructed mental models (predictions and explanations) match those scientifically accepted, one can say that the individual has constructed an adequate mental model of the physical model of the theory. Then, in the light of this discussion, we attempt to interpret the research findings we have obtained so far with college students, regarding mental models and physics education under the framework of Johnson-Laird's mental model theory. The difficulties faced by the students to achieve the understanding of physical theories did not seem to be all of the same level: some are linked to the constraints imposed to the construction of mental models by students' previous knowledge and others, linked to the ways individuals perceive the world, seem to be much more problematic. We argue that teaching should focus on them, at least at introductory level, considering the explicit teaching of the modelling process - or at least its systematic practice - as a tool that might be appropriate to facilitate this process. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036116586

Their underlying cognitive model has an incremental-instrument nature, which tries to evaluate and to prescribe the development of proficiency in academic-cognitive skills, knowledge and autonomy in learners.

The preliminary instrument contained five scales: computer use, information resource use, computer knowledge, capabilities of computer systems, and effects of computers on dental practice. Selected variables were summarized descriptively, and a factor analysis for each scale was performed. In addition, construct validity was assessed through correlational analyses among several variables. Three hundred seventy surveys distributed to students at nine dental schools generated 156 responses (42 percent response rate). Sixty-four percent of respondents were male, 36 percent female. Respondents used computers an average approximately four hours per week, and most had begun using computers in 1991. All survey scales except computer use were unidimensional.

Three hundred forty-five calls, from individuals 11 to 24 years old who phoned from June 1995 to November 1998, were analyzed. Two hundred ninety-four of the callers were female and 51 were male. Greater percentages of females than males called to ask about sexuality and family problems. Males more than females asked about reproductive health (particularly pregnancy) and mental health. There were significant differences by gender and age, differences that were not detected in health service statistics. The findings have implications for decision makers and health and education service providers. They point to the need for programs that will reinforce young people's good health practices and help them avoid risky behaviors.",,"adolescent; adult; article; child; child behavior; counseling; female; human; male; psychological aspect; telephone; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Child; Counseling; Female; Humans; Male; Telephone",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035293559

We will argue, however, that the lexical, syntactic, organizational, and even the material aspects of writing construct identity just as much as do the phonetic and prosodic aspects of speech, and thus writing always conveys a representation of the self of the writer. In this sense, ""voice"" is not an optional extra: All writing contains ""voice"" in the Bakhtinian sense of reaccentuating ""voice types,"" which locate their users culturally and historically. Writers may, through the linguistic and other resources they choose to draw upon in their writing, ventriloquate an environmentally aware voice, a progressive-educator voice, a sexist voice, a positivist voice, a self-assured voice, a deferential voice, a committed-to-plain-English voice, or a combination of an infinite number of such voices. We will illustrate this argument with examples from the writing of six graduate students studying in British universities. We will recommend that an L2 writing pedagogy that raises critical awareness about voice can help learners maintain control over the personal and cultural identity they are projecting in their writing. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Examining the role of phrase-level parallelism on noun phrase number agreement, this article demonstrates that Puerto Rican Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese exhibit more similarities than differences with regard to this constraint. A detailed analysis of Brazilian Portuguese data is presented, and the results are compared with those found by Poplack (1980a) for Puerto Rican Spanish. Guy's (1981a) and Labov's (1994) hypothesis about missing zeroes in Brazilian Portuguese is also discussed.

Firstly, it analyzes the evolution of these concepts and their relevance to the field of education. Next it describes the Brazilian situation with respect to three strategies for measuring illiteracy and literacy: the population census, the evaluations of school systems, and the sampling studies. It analyzes methodological problems of each of those strategies, and their political and ideological implications. With regard to census data, it questions the validity of the criterion adopted by IBGE - less than four years of schooling - to quantify functional illiteracy. It points out the potential of the evaluations of school systems, showing their large repercussion in the media, and the little attention they receive from academic experts. With respect to sampling surveys, the article describes recent international trends and a pioneering initiative to create a national indicator of illiteracy in Brazil. The article underlines the importance of criticizing the myths associated to literacy and of avoiding the stigmas attached to illiteracy. The article concludes that the publication of researches on literacy and their distribution among the population represents a rich opportunity to the society to reflect on its own culture, and on its expectations about the school and other institutions.","Evaluation; Illiteracy; Literacy; Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949107194

However, he did not participate in the movement transforming concepts and methods which crystallized in a new order of geometry at the beginning of the nineteenth century. On the contrary, throughout his life Bolzano tried to demonstrate Euclid's postulate of parallel lines. Two ontological convictions played the role of epistemological obstacle for Bolzano and prevented him even from imagining the possibility that non-Euclidean geometries might exist. In the first place, Bolzano thought that Euclidean geometry had an intrinsic structure and thus geometrical space must be intrinsically Euclidean. Secondly, the description of this structure contained the existence of an ""objective"" connection between geometrical truths; a basic truth was, by its nature, ""simple and general"".

Existing research suggests that the correlations between ICFES scores and GPAs tend to be quite small and vary widely from one academic program to another. Other variables (e.g., high school grades) are better predictors of college GPA, quite likely because the same set of personal and socio-cultural variables are needed for both high school and college success. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The goal of the research project presented here was to examine the effectiveness of CL as perceived by SMET faculty who use it in the classroom at member institutions of the Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP). As a long-term goal, PR-LSAMP researchers desired to use the findings to understand and address the training needs of their SMET faculty. Data was gathered on faculty members' use of CL and their perceptions of the effect of CL strategies on student performance and attitudes. Principal survey results showed that over 60% of faculty felt confident in their knowledge of CL theory and role assignment, although somewhat less confident in conflict resolution, grading activities and individual account-ability. Fifty percent (50%) reported using the strategy very often or often (primarily for the exploration and learning of new concepts, in team projects and presentations, and in quizzes). Forty-one percent (41%) described their experience in implementing CL as excellent or very good. In addition, faculty perceived more positive than negative changes in student performance and attitudes. Based on study results, researchers concluded that the success of cooperative learning in PR-LSAMP institutions signals the beginning of a paradigm shift in the islands' educational system. In addition, results of the study were subsequently used to develop a cadre of SMET faculty to train their peers in various areas of cooperative learning.",,"Curricula; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Classrooms; Cooperative learning; Science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET); Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19644363835

Using this method, qualitative and quantitative comparisons are made to distinguish between teachers who use a conventional, formal, directive approach when teaching 5-year-old children mathematical skills (called the ""Official"" method) and those who use a more interactive, collaborative, supportive, ""scaffolded"" approach to teach similar classes of children (called the ""High Scope"" method). In an earlier study, we found more competent and independent problem-solving among High/Scope pupils than among their peers taught by the Official method. In the present study, discourse analysis and statistical analysis of the relative frequencies of types of teacher-pupil interaction in the classrooms of two ""Official"" teachers and two ""High' Scope"" teachers are used to explain the improved problem-solving of the ""High Scope"" pupils. The findings support the view that by creating a more collaborative, scaffolded version of classroom education, teachers can more successfully enable children to develop their own problem-solving skills, learning strategies and curriculum-related understanding. The research also contributes to the development and implementation of methods for promoting a more effective style of teacher-learner interaction in the classroom.","Collaboration; Interactive teaching-learning strategies; Pre-school education; Problem solving; Scaffolding",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035354516

For these reasons, distinguishing between these two activities is often difficult. There are three important reasons to clarify the distinctions: the moral difference between education research and education practice; federal regulations governing education research that require more safeguards than often exist in education practice; and the fact that student participants in research have characteristics in common with members of special populations. The authors explain why attention to issues of safeguards in education research and practice is likely to grow at academic health centers, yet maintain that these issues are neglected in the medical education literature. They demonstrate this with findings from their review of 424 education research reports published in 1988 and 1989 and in 1998 and 1999 in two major medical education journals. Each article was evaluated for documentation of six ethically important safeguards and features (e.g., informed consent). The rates of reporting the six features and safeguards were relatively low (3-27%). Nearly half (47%) of the empirical reports offered no indication of ethically important safeguards or features, and no article mentioned all six. Furthermore, those rates did not increase substantially after ten years. The authors discuss a number of implications of their findings for faculty, training institutions, students, and editors and peer reviewers, and conclude with the hope that their findings will raise awareness of these neglected issues in medical education and will stimulate all those involved to reflect upon the issues and set standards on the ethical aspects of research and scholarly practice.",,"clinical research; ethics; informed consent; medical education; medical literature; medical student; peer review; policy; priority journal; professional standard; review",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034820612

Prior to literacy, children do not accept as “words” everything that is spoken (articles and prepositions are typical examples of “non-words”). Three independent but related experimental situations were designed to explore whether children counted the same kind of units when a text was presented orally and in written form. The instructions requested subjects “to count the words”, and they had to specify both how many and which ones. The children were at the beginning of their 2nd year in primary school and still showed instability in graphic segmentation. The results show that most frequently there is a discrepancy between the number and the type of units children counted in the two tasks: oral and written, even when the term “word” was used in both cases. Differences were mainly attributed to a preference for counting syllables in the oral task. These results are discussed from three perspectives: (a) conceptual difficulties linked to the notion of “word”; (b) the specific situation of word counting; (c) the writing hypothesis as a model for analysing speech. It is concluded that the writing model is not the most adequate to analyse words in speech. However, writing obliges children to reformulate their pre-literacy notion of what a word is. © 2000, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","conceptualization; Graphic segmentation; literacy; word",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008193981

These defects in procedural knowledge have been described as functional fixedness and functional reduction. This article assesses the procedural difficulties of students (grade 12 and first and third year of university) based on common sense reasoning in two areas of chemistry, chemical equilibrium and geometry and polarity of molecules. In the first area, the theme of external factors affecting equilibria (temperature and concentration change) was selected because the explanations given by the students could be analyzed easily. The existence of a functional fixedness where Le Chatelier's principle was almost exclusively applied by rote could be observed, with this being the cause of the incorrect responses given to the proposed items. Functional fixedness of the Lewis structure also led to an incorrect prediction of molecular geometry. When molecular geometry was correctly determined by the students, it seemed that other methodological or procedural difficulties appeared when the task was to determine molecular polarity. The students showed a tendency, in many cases, to reduce the factors affecting molecular polarity in two possible ways: (a) assuming that polarity depends only on shape (""geometric functional reduction"") or (b) assuming that molecular polarity depends only on the polarity of bonds (""bonding functional reduction""). © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

They also recorded the children's individual characteristics, i.e. family background, nutritional status, and educational attainment, and rated the schools according to educational features such as classroom size, time devoted to learning, and student-teacher ratio. A year later, in 1994, children were re-examined in the schools using the same test battery. All subjects were small for their age, had poor diets, spoke mostly Quechua at home (Spanish in school), lived in a rural environment, and walked considerable distances to school. Regression analyses of the 1993 data indicated that the performance of Quechua children on verbal tests was heavily influenced by family background, while their mathematical competence was related to school experience. On the other hand, improvement in test scores from one year to the next appeared to be strongly related to test performance in 1993 and less clearly to the other recorded variables.

The purpose of this paper is to examine both qualitatively and quantitatively the diachronic evolution of referential behavior in medical English written discourse within a social constructivist perspective. To this end, I analyzed a corpus of 162 medical articles published in 34 different British and American medical journals between 1810 and 1995. The total number of reference patterns was recorded in each article and these were classified according to the following typology: general references, specific references, verbatim quotes, self-references, footnotes and end-lists. The frequency of occurrence of the different referential patterns was then computed per decade, and the results thus obtained were grouped according to the four distinct year-blocks identified in a previous study. Between-block comparisons were performed by means of chi-square tests. Results. Some referential patterns are clearly typical of 19th century medical discourse (verbatim quotes, general and specific references); others typify early 20th century articles (footnotes), and others are truly characteristic of late 20th century medical papers (end-lists). Self-references were found to be atypical, i.e. they have consistently and quite regularly been used throughout the period studied. The results of the present study are commented upon in relation to the web of contextual (i.e. social, cultural, economic and historical) factors that, in different blocks, exerted a strong influence on the way medical science as a whole was conceived and reported. Conclusion. The diachronic evolution observed in the use and frequency of reference patterns over the 185 years studied reflects the conceptual shift from a non-professionalized, privately and individually-based medicine to a professionalized and specialized medicine, a technology-oriented medical research and a highly structured scientific community. © 1999 The American University.

In one set of classrooms the children improved significantly in independent problem-solving. We looked at videotape and transcripts taken over the year to see, retrospectively, whether the reasons for the improvement in problem-solving could be found in the classroom language. Differences in the two sets of data were explored with a method for investigating classroom talk which combines qualitative interpretation with computer-based analysis. This method had been developed to explore peer classroom talk in the UK and was being applied in a new context. A sociocultural model of how children learn independent problem-solving was also developed and applied to the analysis. This model was found to fit a number of types of teaching and learning exchanges found in the classrooms where problem-solving increased. The method used also enabled us to isolate several specific verbal strategies which carried the social construction of knowledge through scaffolding the pupils’ engagement in independent problem-solving and reasoning. As well as these contributions to the theory and practice of education the study illustrates the value and transferability of a new method for investigating classroom talk. © 1999 R.

Adopting Lakatos' Theory of Scientific Research Programmes as the analytical approach, it is proposed that the development, use, and replacement, of specific models forms the core of such programmes.

In the paper The possibilities for innovation in the teaching-learning of elementary mathematics (As possibilidades de inovação no ensino-aprendizagem da matemática elementar, 1995), Manuela David collects what she considered to be the most expressive trends in the current teaching of mathematics in Brazil, remarking that all of them, seeking for a meaning, go beyond the mathematical contents. In the present work we paraphrase Guimarães' text, and take such current trends in the teaching of mathematics (problem solving, modeling, constructivism, ethnomathematics, and what David refers as a teaching committed to social change) trying to identify in them the search for a meaning for the teaching of mathematics. This is done through the re-inclusion of those same elements that were excluded from Linguistics by Sausurre, and neglected by more traditional approaches to school mathematics. What the analysis tries to point out is how the search for meaning in the teaching of mathematics takes a path analogous to that identified by Guimarães in studies of language: the effort to re-include in the approach to school mathematics those elements traditionally excluded: the object, the subject and the history.","Mathematics; Mathematics education; Meaning; Semantics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149133548

Twelve series of textbooks were examined, and the analysis was developed around four pivotal aspects: the form of introduction to the concepts of addition and subtraction, the types of problems proposed, the use of illustrations in the description of the problem, and the type of record asked from children. It has been found that the textbooks examined display little variety with respect to the structure of problems. Thus, problems involving addition are limited to structures of combination and transformation, and the majority of subtraction problems are restricted to the structure of transformation. It has been observed that illustrations are often employed to supply the data related to the problem. In many cases, it has been noted that the illustration itself furnishes the answer to the problem. As to the types of record requested from children, it was clear that they are usually limited to writing the data supplied and the answer in predetermined spaces. Frequently the sign of the operation ""expected"" to solve the problem is indicated. The study concludes that the pre-school textbooks analyzed intend to work with the issue of problem solving but the situations proposed are repetitive and do not stimulate children to develop and contrast different strategies of solution.","Child education; Mathematical problems; Textbooks -",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-53149111556

There were clear differences between the two groups of students in their preference for external representations, in their understanding of the kind of answers they were expected to produce and in the way they conceived the role of mathematics in the practice of science. Although students' preferences for a particular representation were not significantly modified by the use of a spreadsheet as a modelling resource, at the end of the study the students recognised the value of using a more diverse set of representations.

We designed a transversal study with 62 seven-to twelve-year-old children with ADHD and 62 Full Scale IQ-matched controls using two behavioral scales and 13 neuropsychological tests. Using analysis of variance and covariance with age and school achievement and multifactor analysis of variance, we found that behavioral variables established robust, statistically significant differences between groups (p < .001).

Universities and other research institutions have a large number of researchers who study issues related to teacher training at the various levels of schooling. Teachers themselves, either individually or through professional associations, have always been attentive to modifications in teacher training courses and interested in improving their careers through continued education efforts. This article addresses teacher education. Specifically, it discusses teacher education in Brazil and the recent proposals to reform existing programs by the current Brazilian government. First, we argue that recent reforms in teacher education function as resources for economic growth, a view clearly committed to production and productivity. Though the discourse of educational planning also includes the so-called qualitative goals, fundamentally they are quantitative. Second, we argue that a tension between mechanisms to flexibilize the educational process and instruments to control and evaluate its products underlines the government proposals. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The research study is organized as a pedagogical project with peasants, students, teachers and technicians experiencing the construction of an educational process in which local and more global knowledge interacts and where native and technical knowledge are confronted and incorporated. The project allowed the production of a double movement of making community life penetrate the school at the same time as knowledge produced during the pedagogical process pours out from the school space. The approach used in the pedagogical work developed in the Itapuí settlement focused on problems of practical and material needs. They were not transmuted into symbolic control problems, indicating other possibilities in the field of ethnomathematics, especially in mathematics education which is carried out with social movements such as the Landless People Movement. Based on her research, the author emphasizes that ethnomathematics finds its most relevant expression when it exposes its social engagement, when it does not treat cultural questions as exotic and unrooted elements, with no commitment to political struggles widespread throughout the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867428313

The concept of transparency is suggested as an index of access to knowledge and activities rather than as an inherent feature of objects. The analysis shows that transparency is a process mediated by unfolding activities and users' participation in ongoing socioculturel practices.","Functions; Instructional technology; Manipulatives; Middle grades, 5-8; Patterns, relationships in mathematics; Protocol analysis; Representations, modeling; Social and cultural issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944432729

In this work, we examine the effect on student performance of the manipulation of the logical structure as well as of the M-demand of these problems. In addition, we study the relationship between student performance on the problems and a number of cognitive variables, viz., developmental level, working memory capacity, functional M-capacity and disembedding ability of students. In addition, we test the validity of the Johnstone-El-Banna model. Nine problems of varying number of operative schemata, as well as of varying number of M-demand, were used. The number of schemata varied from a minimum of two, to a maximum of four, while within each logical schema we had specific mental demand (M-demand), varying from four to six. As basic molecular-equilibrium schemata in these problems, we considered the following: (1) the process of establishment of chemical equilibrium; (2) the condition of chemical equilibrium; (3) the case of gaseous systems, with use of partial and total pressures as well as of Kp; and (4) the disturbance of equilibrium and the establishment of a new equilibrium. The correlation between student performance in the schemata and the steps of the problem solutions is low when the number of schemata is low, but high when this number is high. Of the cognitive factors studied, developmental level plays the most important role, especially as the logical structure of the problem increases. The other three cognitive variables also have an effect, with working memory capacity leading. The findings are mainly attributed to the fact that the problems were rather algorithmic exercises for the students, because of familiarity and training. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032372135

Experimental studies with secondary school students have demonstrated that some representations are more difficult to articulate than others. Mathematics teachers also have problems of translation preserving meaning when passing from one representation to another. Some of these problems were identified in preliminary studies.

To obtain data about residents' research, knowledge of informatics, and proficiency in English in two pediatric residencies in Argentina. Method. Data collected in 1996 using a ten-item questionnaire were evaluated using EpiInfo software. Regression coefficients, odd ratios, and confidence intervals were calculated using logistic multivariate regression analysis (Hosmer-Lemeshow test). Results. Of 249 residents surveyed, 227 (91.1%) answered the questionnaire. Of those, 224 (98.7%) thought that research during residency was useful; 63% believed that research should be required to obtain residency certification. One third of the respondents had presented at least one work or poster, or had published at least one research article. Among the two thirds who had not done so, the majority explained that they had been hindered by lack of mentors, time, or institutional support. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were reasonably proficient in English. A statistically significant association was found between knowledge of how to use statistical software and publication of papers (OR 4.5; 95% CI, 1.37-15.62; p < .003). Conclusion. The vast majority of respondents thought that research was useful and should be included in pediatric residency programs. Most thought that it should be required to obtain residency certification. If it is to be required, it should include trained, full-time mentors, time exclusively devoted to research, and courses in research methodology, informatics, and statistics.",,"adult; Argentina; article; certification; computer program; female; human; information science; male; pediatrics; priority journal; regression analysis; residency education",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031874254

This educational article addresses two alternative computational procedures of approximate nature for solving this modified Bessel equation: (a) the Frobenius method, and (b) the power series method coupled with a curve fit. Approximate temperature distributions of good quality have been obtained with available symbolic algebra software such as Maple or Mathematica on a personal computer. The primary specification when designing annular fins of uniform thickness is the amount of heat transfer from a tube to the surrounding fluid. These calculations are traditionally done with the help of a fin efficiency diagram. The fin efficiencies can be computed approximately by integration or by differentiation via the Frobenius and power series methods as well. Students of heat transfer courses can benefit from these two alternative computational procedures that seek to circumvent the use and operations with Bessel functions and still produce approximate analytic results of good caliber. A course on ordinary differential equations is the only mathematical background that students need to have to implement these computational techniques. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Annular fins; Frobenius method; Power series method","Computer software; Curve fitting; Differential equations; Engineering education; Heat transfer; Numerical methods; Temperature distribution; Thermoanalysis; Tubes (components); Annular fins; Frobenius method; Modified Bessel equation; Power series method; Fins (heat exchange)",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031674407

The aim of this article is to apply some theoretical concepts, drawn from the fields of sociolinguistics and rhetoric, to the analysis of argumentation in a lesson conducted in an urban middle school classroom. Our analysis focuses on the implementation of the classroom teacher's instructional goals during a lesson on area measurement. As a result of our analyses, we found that she achieved her instructional goals of being nondirective in her teaching and getting students actively involved in arguing about mathematical concepts. The teacher was able to orchestrate discussion by recruiting attention and participation from her class, aligning students with argumentative positions through reported speech, highlighting positions through repetition, and pointing out important aspects of their arguments through expansion. In addition, we also found that her students differed in the way they framed the mathematical content of the lesson in terms of the facts or grounds, algorithms or warrants, premises or backings, as well as solutions or claims. Their arguments also varied in terms of explicitness and ability to integrate their classmates' arguments. In conclusion, we feel that discourse analysis, based on sociolinguistic and rhetorical theoretical frameworks, can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of educational reform in mathematics.",,,"Ford Foundation: 890-0572; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW; University of Pittsburgh","Preparation of this paper was supported, in part, by grants from the University of Pittsburgh (School of Education Faculty Research Fund, Central Research Development Fund), from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (National Center for Improving Student Learning and Achievement in Mathematics and Science) to the first author, a Fulbright Fellowship to the second author, and a grant from the Ford Foundation (number 890-0572) to Edward Silver, LRDC, for the QUASAR Project.

Later, when he advances in the study of high frequencies, he will find this kind of transformation in issues like synthesis of signal separation structures and n-port reflectometer calibration and measurement. However, for each appearing transformation, there is generally an individual treatment with no connection to the others, and with a minimum interpretation of its geometrical significance, which impedes a thorough appraisal of generalized transformation attributes. In order to give a global perspective of bilinear transformation uses in microwaves, this paper presents a unified notion and includes geometrical exegesis for some particular applications. In this way, the bilinear transformations between parameters, parameter matrices, and matrix eigenvalues related to microwaves are presented in a congruous and connected form. These transformations are single-valued functional relations of a complex variable between immittance (impedance and admittance) and reflection coefficient parameters, reflection coefficient and power parameters, and immittance and scattering parameters.","Bilinear or homographic transformations; Microwaves; Möbius","Calibration; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electric variables measurement; Frequencies; Mathematical transformations; Matrix algebra; Microwave circuits; Reflectometers; Bilinear transformation; Impedance transformation; Smith chart; Microwaves","IMC-2000/95/011; Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Manuscript received May 18, 1994; revised October 4, 1996.

This course was designed to address discrepancies between how students learn and how they were traditionally being taught. Based on results from the first implementation, pedagogical changes were made, including increased computer programming activities and other exercises which were designed to give the students the opportunity to build experience to draw on in order to construct understanding of the topics in class. A second experimental course was run. To assess the impact of these methods, and to continue to better understand how students go about learning, test results from the latter class and interviews with students from both experimental courses and a lecture-based class were analyzed. The students in the second experimental course demonstrated a deep understanding of the title concepts, especially cosets and normality. We discuss the details of the revised experimental course; the epistemological theory behind its design; and the framework used to analyze the results. We demonstrate through examples from interviews and test results the applicability of this analysis to the data, and the strides made by the students in comparison with the students from the lecture-based course, and with the students from the first experimental course.

Taught by three primary professors and augmented by various on-site discussants, the semester-long curriculum integrated sociology and political economy with agricultural ecology. Our guiding philosophy dictated that the curriculum be empirically based, involve working collaboratively, and utilize multidisciplinary investigation. Faculty members and students worked together in a number of sites throughout the country to investigate the human and environmental problems of sustainability. Students were open to interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a learning community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031505833

Literally, one particular case corresponds to external forced convective cooling, which is invariant with the tube orientation. Another particular case corresponds to external natural convection cooling, which depends on the tube orientation. For both cases, a simple one-dimensional (1-D) lumped formulation enabled the determination of the mean bulk and wall temperature distributions of the internal fluid flow as well as the total rate of heat transfer in a finite tube length within the region of thermal development. Streamwise-mean values for the internal Nusselt numbers have been taken from standard correlation equations reported in undergraduate textbooks on heat transfer. Meanwhile, streamwise-mean values for the external Nusselt numbers have been extracted from articles published in the open literature. The combination of both Nusselt numbers leads to the calculation of a streamwise-mean, equivalent Nusselt number, which serves to regulate the thermal interaction between the two fluid streams. Representative results for a selected combination of internal and external fluids, expressed in terms of their thermal conductivity ratios, are discussed at length. The computed thermal quantities (global and local) based on a 1-D lumped model compared favorably with those based on a more general and rigorous 2-D differential model, which inevitably necessitated a finite-difference methodology and a personal computer. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","External natural convection; In-tube forced convection; Lumped-based model","Calculations; Computer simulation; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Nusselt number; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Tubes (components); External natural convection; Lumped based model; Natural convection",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030678729

A new curricula is discussed, where there is an special emphasis on reducing student course load, bringing together classes and lab work, fully integrating a variety of new computational tools to the teaching-learning process, and giving students more freedom to choose from a diversity of specialized fields. The new Department structure is also presented, eliminating the current departmentalized organization based on three major electrical engineering fields, i.e., power systems, control, and communications.

A NEW UNIVERSITY In order to have an integral proposal, one cannot ignore higher level structures that must change. This section addresses this concem, and suggests some changes that should take place in all Ecuadorian universities. First of all, the current National Council of Universities and Polytechnic Schools (CONUEP in Spanish), made up by the chancellors of all public and private universities, should be replaced by a University Coordinating Council independent from universities, to finally address the old autonomy problem. This Council should be composed by several qualified appointees of government, industry and the universities themselves. Its main attributes would be: Define the goals of universities according to the country devel-opment plans. Evaluate universities according to academic, administrative, and financial issues; the latter only in the case of public universities. This evaluation should consider: quality of students, graduates and professors, employment rates for graduates, results obtained on research projects and services to industry and local com-munities, funding record, number and quality of publications, etc. These evaluations should be made public, so that interested parties could have a reference on university performance. Distribute government funds among public universities accord-ing to the before mentioned evaluation, government development plans, and costs per student per career. Authorize the creation of new universities and careers based on development priorities, financial studies, and needs for proposed careers and graduates. Also reorganize or close down universities that are consistently failing on their evaluations. Worker representation should completely disappear from all university governing bodies and academic councils. Students should have some representation on governing bodies, but reducing the current aliquots; however, they should not be part of any academic council. Finally, all administrative and academic posts should not be elected but appointed by the respective council. Chancellors should be appointed by the University Coordinating Council, on the basis of administrative qualifications and academic achievements, and Deans and Area Chairmen, who should be able to manage their own budgets, must be named by the corresponding council based on similar criteria. Universities should not be free for all students. Students that pass entrance exams should pay according to the tuition and fees that they used to pay in high school (in Ecuador most high schools are private). This reform has been already approved at the EPN. Finally, research must be propelled by government funds if the country is to develop any technological and scientific advancements at all, and eventually move out of its current Third World status. A creation of a Science Foundation is proposed, similar to NSF in the US or NSERC in Canada, primarily supported by government funds, and in charge of distributing those funds among the different universities, based on regular evaluations considering govemment development plans, industry interest, research results, publications, etc.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030082117

A simple one‐dimensional lumped‐based formulation enabled the determination of the mean bulk and wall temperature distributions of the internal fluid flow as well as the total rate of heat transfer between two axial stations in the region of thermal development. Streamwise‐mean values for the internal and circumferential‐mean values for the external Nusselt numbers have been taken from standard correlations reported in undergraduate textbooks on heat transfer, leading to the immediate calculation of a mean, equivalent Nusselt number, which serves to regulate the thermal interaction between the two fluid streams. Representative results for a complete combination of internal and external fluids, expressed in terms of their respective thermal conductivity ratios, are discussed at length. The thermal quantities were computed with a pocket‐size calculator and compared favorably with those based on a more general and rigorous two‐dimensional differential formulation. The latter was utilized as a baseline solution, and inevitably required a finite‐difference procedure on a personal computer.

Subjects: 36 Spanish‐speaking medical graduates of different L2 proficiency—18 High Intermediate (HI) and 18 Advanced subjects (AD)—were randomly divided into 2 sub‐groups of 9 subjects. Design: Rhetorical manipulations were performed on the published versions of three semantically different medical English abstracts (familiar and relatively unfamiliar topics). Each sub‐group received one of either version and completed a reading test. A questionnaire elicited background information on the subjects. Self‐generated comments on the abstracts were optional. Statistical Treatment of Data: The number of correct answers for each abstract was recorded. Between‐group one‐ and two‐way ANOVAs were applied. The questionnaires and self‐generated comments were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results: Both groups differed in their background knowledge and in their intensity of English reading. The AD subjects outperformed the HI ones in reading performance for all three abstracts together, and for the two relatively unfamiliar abstracts only. No difference was observed for the familiar abstract. In the well structured but relatively unfamiliar abstract, only L2 competence affected reading performance. In the relatively unfamiliar and poorly structured abstract, text structure, L2 competence and the interaction between both variables affected reading comprehension. Conclusions: Textual variables operate differently depending on the extent of the readers’ background knowledge and linguistic competence. Variables such as exposure to reading materials (in L1 and L2), background knowledge and L2 competence seem to outweigh the importance of structural variables. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

This dimension, based on the theories of Werner, Within and Pascual-Leone suggests, that field mobile students perform better than fixed students in science courses. The main objective of this study, based on high school students (mean age = 16.5 years; SD =1.0) in Venezuela, was to test the following predictions. (1) Mobile students would obtain a better performance than fixed students on variables such as introductory high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and earth science courses; and (2) among mobile students, those classified in the middle-high range of the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the Figural Intersection Test (FIT), would obtain a better performance as compared to those in the lower-middle range. Results obtained, in general, provide support for the first prediction. The differences between the performances of mobile and fixed groups were, however, significant (p < 0.05) only for the biology and earth science courses. Students in one of the high mobility groups obtained a better performance (in all courses) than not only the corresponding low mobility group but also a fixed group with high scores on both the GEFT and FIT, which provides support for the second prediction.

Over many years Latin American universities have operated ‘extension projects’ in their surrounding communities. These projects, in health professions schools, frequently involved the establishment of community‐based health centres operated by the university. Since the early 1970s, a large number of health professions schools entered into agreements with local or regional health systems for the operation of projects of ‘articulation of teaching and services’ in well‐defined geographic areas. The primary health care strategy emphasized by WHO and actively promoted by national governments since the led to a worldwide movement toward effective ‘community participation’ in each own local health system. An assessment of these initiatives, involving three types of paired relationships (university—community; university—local health system; local health system‐community) provided the idea and the experiential basis for an innovative programme bringing the three partners together in a joint effort. Program UNT was set up and now includes 23 projects which are partially supported by the Kellogg Foundation. They all share a common set of ideas and ideals, emanating from the Alma Ata and Edinburgh Declarations, and are currently being implemented in 11 countries of Latin America. 1994 Blackwell Publishing","*community health services; *interprofessional relations; *student health services; Brazil","article; community care; geography; health practitioner; health service; medical education; south and central america; university; world health organization; Brazil; Community Health Services; Human; Student Health Services",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027972058

It is plausible to suggest that if the information is presented in differing formats, the cognitive demand of a problem changes. The main objective of this study is to investigate the degree to which cognitive variables, such as developmental level, mental capacity, and disembedding ability explain student performance on problems which: (1) could be addressed by algorithms or (2) require conceptual understanding. All conceptual problems used in this study were based on a figurative format. The results obtained show that in all four problems requiring algorithmic strategies, developmental level of the students is the best predictor of success. This could be attributed to the fact that these are basically computational problems, requiring mathematical transformations. Although all three problems requiring conceptual understanding had an important aspect in common (the figurative format), in all three the best predictor of success is a different cognitive variable. It was concluded that: (1) the ability to solve computational problems (based on algorithms) is not the major factor in predicting success in solving problems that require conceptual understanding; (2) solving problems based on algorithmic strategies requires formal operational reasoning to a certain degree; and (3) student difficulty in solving problems that require conceptual understanding could be attributed to different cognitive variables. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","cognitive variables; conceptual understanding algorithms; problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038846631

First of all, an Educational Reform made up for the rapid expansion of a huge private sector where small teaching institutions prevail and which now absorbs over 60% of Brazilian students. The public sector, in turn, was substantially improved: the number of full time faculty increased and teachers in the federal universities were encouraged to apply for a M.A. or a Ph.D. and to get involved with research activities. Meanwhile, a dual funding system (teaching and research) emerged which was responsible both for the creation of graduate programmes all over the country and for the expansion of a research infrastructure. The civilian government (1985 on) brought policy making out of the bureaucracy and into the Congress. The new Constitution granted the university a degree of autonomy it had never enjoyed before which, however, is still to be regulated by further legislation. Policy initiatives driving at institutional differentiation and at performance assessment have systematically failed to become effective due to resistances within the university itself. Meanwhile financial stringency at a time of recession necessarily leads to reductions in funding, notably for research. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21144481055

During the 1980-1990 period, Chilean Higher Education underwent drastic changes under a Military Government, directed to the achieving of three main goals: to open-up the Higher Education system, to differentiate its institutional structures, and to partially transfer the cost of state-financed institutions to the students and/or their families (cost recovery) thus forcing these institutions to diversify their funding sources. As a result of the 1980 reforms, both the institutional composition and the financing of Higher Education experienced dramatic changes. New establishments mushroomed. In turn, the rapid increase in the number of institutions resulted in three major effects:first, Higher Education became private-dominant in the non-university levels and has now a dual public/private nature at the university level;second, establishments grew more regionally dispersed but overall enrolment distribution changed in the direction of a still higher concentration in the capital city;third, creation of new entrance opportunities shows an increasing over-extension with respect to enrolment demand. Also funding of Higher Education was drastically altered by the 1980 reforms. Incremental funding was replaced by a diversified funding system which contemplates the employment of four different mechanisms: public institutional core funding, competitive public allocations rewarding institutions that enrol the best students, a Government financed student-loan scheme, and competitive financing of research projects. A new, democratically elected Government was established in 1990. Its Higher Education policies include three major objectives: to fully restore institutional autonomy cancelling all measures of governmental intervention and reinstating the right of faculty members to freely choose their authorities and provide for the self-government of public universities; to increase public spending without changing the diversified-funding approach adopted by the former Government, and to change the legal framework of Higher Education with the aim of introducing more stringent accreditation and evaluation procedures and institutional accountability. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21144459351

However, without exception, such courses are generally offered assuming a modest mathematical prerequisite—usually a course in college algebra—and do not make use of any calculus-based analytical techniques. The use of calculus in an introductory biostatistics course facilitates a rigorous treatment of various statistical concepts and principles and helps to demonstrate many results which the students would have to take on faith, otherwise. Moreover, it permits a more complete discussion of continuous probability distributions. Though calculusbound statistics courses are now well-entrenched in a variety of undergraduate and graduate level programmes in mathematics, statistics, computer sciences, operations research, and other physical, engineering, and management sciences, the use of calculus in a biostatistics course is not yet in vogue. This is primarily because of the non-calculus background of the majority of students who enter biological, medical, and health-related disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to consider the feasibility of a calculus-based course for graduate students in health sciences. Such a course will use some calculus, but will not require calculus as a prerequisite. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442737919

A problem statement is regarded as a text from which the student must glean prepositional and situational information and make critical inferences. The competent student must coordinate this information with known problem models so that formal (i.e., algebraic) operations can be applied and exact solutions can be obtained. We argue that this task is a highly reading-oriented one in which poor text comprehension and an inability to access relevant long-term knowledge lead to serious errors. in particular, poor students often omit from their solutions or misspecify necessary mathematical constraints that are based on reading inferences needed to describe fully the problem situation. Furthermore, formal algebraic expressions are so abstract that their meaning is often elusive; this contributes to mistranslations and misinterpretations. The competent approach is teachable, however. We describe experimental results with ANIMATE, a learning environment that knows nothing of the problem at hand or of the student’s actions. Subjects encouraged to reason explicitly about the situations described in typical word problems consistently performed as well as or better than those who were not, in both training and transfer tasks. We conclude that, by using an environment that gives equations situation-based meaning through computer animation, students learn to relate formal expressions to the referent situations. This enhances problem comprehension and gives a stronger representational base to the problem-solving process. A call for evaluation methods beyond just algebra problem-solving performance is made. The implications of this work for the design of future computer-based tutors and other learning environments are also discussed. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This has also been true of Colombia, where private higher education has grown more rapidly than the official sector to the point of accounting for 60% of total enrollment due to the State's inability to increase the number of its institutions and to provide them with growing budgets. Given the greater efficiency in expenditure demonstrated by private institutions, a comparison is made of their income and expenditure structure with that of public institutions and differences are established in order to define those areas in which greater internal efficiency can be achieved. In spite of the total cost of higher education in Colombia it is relatively low due to the prevalence of low salaries and lack of equipment or sophisticated facilities and due also to the fact that research is still in an incipient stage. Faced with problems of fairness toward lower income families that must pay more than they can afford, or on the other hand, those who could pay more but are receiving free state education, a state subsidy is proposed to carry out a direct transfer to the student, while all state universities would charge tuition that would cover the cost of instruction. This subsidy should be channelled through ICETEX, a pioneer institution in the world in the field of student financing through credit.

The influence of the converter on the voltage applied to the dc motor is considered. The final model includes all significant effects, has the same structure for continuous and discontinuous current conduction modes, and allows simple control synthesis. The model is compared to the classical model of a dc motor and the differences are highlighted. With the proposed model, it is easy to understand the influence of a thyristor converter on the dynamic performance of a dc motor and, therefore, this formulation has a significant educational aspect. A dual-mode adaptive current controller is designed using this model.

Many of those who would have studied in the United States if this decrease had not occurred would have returned home to serve their countries. To estimate the impact of this loss, a survey was conducted in six major cities in Latin America between 1983 and 1989. Selected local medical students interviewed 554 physicians who had returned home after U.S. trai ing and 60 of their classmates who had not trained there. The findings indicate that the returned physicians had given approximately twice as much time to teaching, research, and medical administration as did those who had not left home.

Given the following sentence: There are six times as many students (S) as professors (P) at this university, most students write the following equation: 6S = P, referred to as the reversal error. In order to overcome the reversal error students need to operate in a hypothetico‐deductive manner, i.e., performing a hypothetical operation that makes the group of professors six times larger than it really is (S = 6P). The objective of this study is to investigate the relation between student ability to translate sentences into equations, equations into sentences, and student performance in the following variables: formal operational reasoning, proportional reasoning, and introductory freshmen‐level chemistry course. The results obtained show that as the student ability to translate sentences into equations and equations into sentences increases, their mean scores in Chemistry I, formal operational, and proportional reasoning increases.

They were observed at work while dealing with clients and while solving modified problems based on naturalistic observations. At work, regardless of their level of instruction, bookies were always highly efficient. When solving modified problems presented by the examiner, unschooled bookies often refused to try to solve some of them; when they attempted to solve the problems, however, their proportion of correct answers was similar to that found among more schooled subjects. Number of correct answers and a more general ability to analyze and to explain verbally the relationships and the mathematical models involved in the game correlated significantly with school instruction.

This paper considers the difficulties and the potential of exchanges between central and peripheral countries, based on an analysis of the evolutionary process of science education in Brazil. The conclusion reached is that, if international cooperation is to lead to an effective modernization of science education, a number of conditions have to be fulfilled: Didactic materials must be adapted to local needs and cannot simply be transplanted; there is a need to concentrate activities in the training of human resources; mechanisms for the diffusion of innovation have to be enlarged, and contacts be established between diverse groups that represent, pluralistically, the various tendencies in a certain field of work. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","The group of teachers and researchers that made up the FUNBEC team, in an attempt to make their programme feasible, started to produce prototypes of equipment to substitute for the existing equipment which, up to that time, had been imported from Europe. The search was for cheap and functional solutions, appropriate to the proposals for educational renewal and to the economic conditions of the country. As there were no industries in Brazil manufacturing science teaching materials, it was necessary to set up a factory to manufacture such materials and thus make them accessible to schools. The equipment was accompanied by instructions so that the teachers could organize practical work. Dissemination of the new methodologies and of the materials was carried out in courses held for teachers. This set of activities, which constituted FUNBEC'S work programme, was well underway when two things occurred that directly affected the Brazilian programme. One was the creation of the NSF (National Science Foundation) aimed at stimulating and financing basic research, initiating programmes to reinforce the scientific potential and to finance science education programmes. The second was the Soviet's scientific progress, symbolized by the launching of the Sputnik in 1959 (Gatewood and Obourn 1963). It was during this period which Hurd (1961) called a 'period of crisis in science education' that the embryos of the great curriculum projects, now known as 'alphabet soup', appeared and altered the evolution of scientific disciplines in the United States, and later, in the regions under the influence of this cultural domain. In the 1960s, the curriculum projects (Welch 1979) reached their peak and began to inspire changes that went beyond the range of science education and geographical frontiers. International organizations such as the OEA and UNESCO 'intensified their programmes aimed at stimulating the improvement of science education on the preuniversity level in developing countries' (Baez 1976). The FUNBEC group, which already had a reputation on the international scene, soon began an association with the North American curriculum projects of the first",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249108118

Foremen's perfomance was more accurate than students' but a greater proportion of students used a generalizable problem-solving strategy of finding and working with a simplified ratio (l/x or x/l). The school-taught proportions algorithm (x/a = b/c) had no significant impact upon students' problem-solving strategies. Students' performance revealed a strong ability to deal with the rule-based aspects of the mathematics in the problem but their ability to deal with meaning was weak; in contrast, job experience seems to enrich measurement with meaning.

By introducing a concept of culture which calls for an analysis of individual and social behaviours, we are lead to recognize ‘ethnomathematics’ as a form of structured knowledge and to recognize ‘matheracy’ as a characteristic behaviour of human beings. Upon these two concepts, we introduce a theoretical framework for curriculum development in mathematics. Curricular space is conceptualized as a three-dimensional space with components, contents, methods and objectives considered solidarily. This relies upon an epistemology of action, based on an integration of episteme, techne and praxis. This allows for an approach in which theory and practice are in a dialectical relationship.

Most major innovations in medical education have occurred in a small number of new schools. Attempts to create change in traditional schools are far more complex. Relevant models for such change are few and there is an urgent need for institutions pioneering such changes to learn from each other's experiences. Two conventional medical schools described in this paper have attempted to create community‐oriented institutional change by establishing experimental undergraduate curricular tracks. One is in a developing country, Mexico, the other in a technically developed country, the United States. These new tracks in medical education evolved independently of one another, yet they have many similarities and have experienced common problems. A formal exchange between the two schools has led to new insights in medical education and improvements to both programmes. Exchange agreements like the one reported here would be valuable for other medical schools in both developing and technically developed countries. 1985 Blackwell Publishing","*Curriculum; *Education, medical, undergraduate; Community medicine/*educ; Mexico; New Mexico; Primary health care","community medicine; education; geographic distribution; human; medical education; normal human; organization and management; primary health care; Community Medicine; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Mexico; New Mexico; Primary Health Care",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0021844593

This achieves an independent way of thinking in the students. MAT-100 is taken by all the students that enter the University. It is divided into 26 learning units that go from the Cartesian Plane and Functions to Differential Equations in Partial Derivatives. Every Learning Unit is divided into learning modules, each of which is subdivided into activities with their own learning objectives and exercises of auto-evaluation. The students are distributed in sections of approximately 50. Each section is attended by a professor and a student aid. In class the students work in groups where they do workshops and consult, studying the Units, solving exercises and resolving auto-evaluation tests. Lectures are given periodically on the most difficult topics. When the student feels prepared, he presents an exam which is given weekly. The exams are corrected by a computer DEC-10 with a system programmed in SIMULA.

A brief analysis of the nature of mathematical reasoning and hints of the sociology of mathematics precede a brief account of the birth of modern science and technology, as well as a capsule account of the evolution of medieval society and the place of science and education in it. Some remarks on the political changes in this century set the tone for questioning the nature of mathematics, of mathematical creativity and the role of mathematics education in enhancing creativity. A glance on what we see as a future for mathematics education, with implications for developing societies, closes the paper. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889993833

Prior to this decision, a feasibility project was mounted in 1973-1976 by the University of Antioquia. Code-named El Proyecto UNIDES, its goals were:- To check whether students could learn at a distance with no lowering of standards; - To identify critical logistical conditions; - To assess whether traditional university teaching methods could be renovated with systems resting on ideas from instructional technology. UNIDES involved 70 staff of varying status and function who produced teaching materials and observed and assessed around 1500 students on and off campus under three instructional conditions covering a semester's work. D group students studied at a distance self-instructional materials in mathematics, psychology, and Spanish. S1 group students studied those materials individually on campus. S2 group students studied through conventional classes. Political confrontations with non-project students, staff anxieties, administrative, production, printing, distribution, and communication difficulties, and a 50-60 per cent dropout were unexpected events observed. This yielded valuable information about critical conditions in distance-teaching for practical decision-making in the future, but made assessment difficult. In academic performance, measured by common examinations for course credits, the groups ranked: S1, D and S2. There could be no clear-cut prediction from UNIDES. It suggested students can learn at a distance with no drop in standards, perhaps better through an autonomous system. Conventional systems might profit from adopting or adapting methods and materials developed for distance teaching. © 1979 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250264841

This study seems to support the idea that one of the causes of failure in disabled learners is their lack of motivation to perform at their best. Specifically, this study investigated the effects of incentives for good performance on the selection and use of an efficient task strategy by children who were experiencing difficulty learning to read. Both good and poor readers in the incentive group increased their recall and rehearsal between sessions, while the performance of the control group remained stable. Incentives led not only to an increase in the amount of rehearsal shown by poor readers, but also to an increase in the number of children reporting that they used the strategy. © 1979, Council for Learning Disabilities.

Using arguments based on the observed pattern of mathematical education, we discuss the effect of the use of HHCs, from the learning viewpoint and from the viewpoint of providing students with a ready competence in arithmetical manipulation. We shall also discuss the effects of the adoption of HHCs in undeveloped countries and for deprived minorities. The topics are developed from philosophical/psychopedagogical reasoning and from developmental policy. Strategies designed to make mathematical education more immediately useful are discussed. An example is provided, and the relationship between Polya's problem-solving approach and the use of HHCs is examined. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946323117

Although the basic parameters of educational productivity are difficult to define precisely, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) looks to offer the possibility of reduced instructional costs on the one hand, and increased output from the educational system on the other. Such increased output includes the ability of CAI procedures to extend educational facilities to persons and groups to whom they would otherwise probably be denied, and thus represents a role for CAI in increasing equality of educational opportunity. There is, however, a number of key questions concerning CAI and its interrelationship with the traditional educational structure which must be answered, and some of these questions arc enumerated. © 1973, MCB UP Limited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955780243

This is the basis of programmed instruction. The effect of increased amounts of review on the learning of elementary electrical engineering material was studied in the experiment reported here. Significant improvements in performance on a criterion test were obtained by increasing the amount of review material, even though many electrical engineering educators felt the amount of review was excessive before adding the new material. Programs in vector algebra and static magnetic fields were written with 150 and 121 frames, respectively. Additional reviews approximately doubling the length of the programs were then provided. The class in Field Bases of Electrical Engineering at The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, was divided into groups which received programs of different lengths. At the completion of the programs, all students were given the same criterion test. The significant improvement caused by the added review material was not present for those students with enough knowledge of vector algebra so that the program itself was a review.
