The model is research based as it considered a literature review for adequate selection and design of activities consistent with the levels of students' reasoning skills. The level of scientific reasoning is positively correlated to student success. By contrast to a control group of students following traditional lectures, we observed a significant reduction in failure rate for students that do not yet possess formal scientific reasoning. This profile of students being the majority, we conclude that implementing active learning is particularly suited to the first year of higher education in the context of a developing country. It fits the particularities of student profile and typical classroom size, leading to learning improvement and reduction of academic risk, as well as being financially sound.;"[Lagubeau, Guillaume; Tecpan, Silvia; Hernandez, Carla] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile";;Lagubeau, G (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile.;"guillaume.lagubeau@usach.cl; silvia.tecpan@usach.cl; carla.hernandez.s@usach.cl";Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/I-9567-2018;"Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/0000-0001-9343-6863; Hernandez-Silva, Carla/0000-0003-2974-4989";"CONICYT through Proyecto Fondecyt de Iniciacion [11170580]; Proyecto DICYT USACH [031931TF]";We thank Vicerrectoria Academica USACH through Convenio Marco CM USA1856, and the Engineering Faculty of USACH.

Limited evidence exists regarding their effectiveness in improving academic performance among medical students. This study aims to assess whether a smartphone application could improve academic performance in multiple-choice tests. Methods: A double-masked randomised trial was held among interns at the School of Medicine of the Universidad de Valparaiso. Participants were randomised to receive an application designed to review key concepts in Internal Medicine and its subspecialties using clinical vignettes. Contents were selected and provided in a format akin to a mandatory national examination required for practising medicine in Chile. Analyses were undertaken under the intention to treat principle and missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques. Results: Eighty interns volunteered to participate in this trial, most were female (48 students, 60%) and had a mean age of 25.3 +/- 2.2 years. Participants showed significant experience with smartphones, with a median use of 4 years (IQR 3-6 years) and 67 (83.7%) reporting routine use in clinical practice. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements in performance amongst students allocated to the smartphone application (mean increase of 14.5 +/- 8.9 vs 9.4 +/- 11.6points, p = 0.03). A reduction in total time and mean time per question was also found, which was significant in complete-case analyses (p = 0.04). Discussion: Smartphones were popular among medical trainees. Academic performance was significantly improved by the use of our application, although the overall effect was smaller than expected from previous trials. This study provides evidence that smartphone-based interventions can assist in teaching internal medicine.;"[Martinez, Felipe] Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile; [Martinez, Felipe] Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Tobar, Catalina] Hosp Gustavo Fricke, Dept Med Interna, Alvares 1532, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Taramasco, Carla] Univ Valparaiso, Lab Informac & Tecnol, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso 222, Chile";;"Martinez, F (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile.; Martinez, F (corresponding author), Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile.";felipe.martinez@uv.cl;Martinez, Felipe/ABF-5868-2021;Martinez, Felipe/0000-0002-9857-8403;;;;17;9;9;0;17;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1472-6920;;BMC MED EDUC;BMC Med.

Yet we lack a complete understanding of how different instructional strategies impact the relationship between cooperation and learning. In this paper we present results from a field experiment with 82 first-year students in an introductory physics course showing how different instructional strategies led to different social configurations in the classroom and to differences in individual academic performance. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively sought out information from multiple peers were less likely to perform well on well-structured problems as compared to those who did not seek help, whereas, for ill-structured (real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the learning environment. We observed that good performance on ill- and well-structured problems was sensitive to different social network configurations. In a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students performed better on well-structured problems than ill-structured problems. By contrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access to more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems promoted creative thinking, provided that instructors guided the problem-solving process and motivated students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems entailed. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional strategies play an important role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing cooperative learning methods have to accompany them with adequate instructional strategy.";"[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Northwestern Inst Complex Syst NICO, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Ctr Invest Complejidad Social CICS, Las Condes 7550000, Chile; [Leonardi, Paul M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coll Engn, Technol & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";;Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.;"jpulgar@ubiobio.cl; cristian.candia@kellogg.northwestern.edu";;"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Candia Vallejos, Cristian/0000-0002-9654-543X";AAPT E.

However, due to their constrained nature, these problems hinder collaboration and idea generation. In order to encourage student collaboration and decision making demands among undergraduate students in an introductory physics course, we utilized a real-world problem where groups were asked to compose a well-structured physics problem for younger learners. In this study we explored how they collaborated in composing physics problems. Data collection consisted of audio recording of the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their physics problems and their respective problem solutions. Through interviews, we accessed participants' perceptions of the task and related challenges. Results suggest that composing problems is an opportunity for participants to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details, and magnitudes and units to introduce in their activities. Further, participants valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced by them with traditional well-structured problems. These findings shed light on the nature of composing physics problems in undergraduate courses, where participants assume a different role by facing a real-world activity that encourages expertise through physics-related communication and writing.;"[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Fahler, Valentina; Spina, Alexis] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Gevirtz Grad Sch Educ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";;Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.;jpulgar@ubiobio.cl;;"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Fahler, Valentina/0000-0002-9883-9052; Spina, Alexis/0000-0002-9219-7888";AAPT E.

The study consisted of two phases starting with designing a computational chemistry based learning environment followed by a case study where students' perceptions towards educational computational chemistry were explored. First, we designed an authentic research-based chemistry learning module that supported problem-based learning through the utilisation of computational chemistry methods suitable for pre-service chemistry education. The objective of the learning module was to promote learning of specific chemistry knowledge and development of scientific skills. Systematic design decisions were made through the TPASK framework. The learning module was designed for a third-year physical chemistry course taken by pre-service chemistry teachers in Chile. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in a course, and students' perceptions were gathered using semi-structured group interviews. The sample consisted of 22 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis using the same TPASK framework employed in the learning module design. Based on our findings, pre-service chemistry teachers first acquired Technological Scientific Knowledge (TSK) and then developed some elements of their TPASK. Besides, they highly appreciated the combination of student-centred problem-based learning and the use of computational chemistry tools. Students felt the educational computational learning environment supported their own knowledge acquisition and expressed an interest in applying similar learning environments in their future teaching careers. This case study demonstrates that learning through authentic real-world problems using educational computational methods offers great potential in supporting pre-service teachers' instruction in the science of chemistry and pedagogy. For further research in the TPASK framework, we propose there would be significant benefit from developing new learning environments of this nature and evaluating their utility in pre-service and in-service chemistry teacher's education.;"[Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Bahamonde Padilla, Victor] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile; [Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Druker, Sofia] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Diaz, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Dept Educ Diferencial, Santiago, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, AI Virtasen Aukio 1,POB 55, Helsinki 00014, Finland";;"Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile.; Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile.";jorge.rodriguez@umce.cl;"BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017; Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021";"BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X; Druker, Sofia/0000-0002-0934-4825";"DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [FGI 46-18]; Doctorate in Education Program - UMCE, Chile [PIPedI20164]; Programa Extraordinario de Becas de Postgrado - Doctorado en Educacion - UMCE";This research was supported by the FGI 46-18 project (DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile).

Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to test the role of NOS instruction in enhancing students' learning about evolution. We used a quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-tests to investigate the impact of teaching evolution with and without NOS in two classes with 15-16-year-old students, who were randomly assigned to these two classes. To measure their understanding of NOS and their acceptance and understanding of evolution, we used three different instruments that have been shown to generate reliable and valid inferences in comparable populations. The main results of this study were that, in the class in which the teaching of evolution included NOS instruction, the students' understanding of NOS and their acceptance of evolution significantly improved. However, irrespective of the use of NOS instruction, both classes increased their understanding of evolution. These results support the claim that NOS instruction may influence students' acceptance of evolution but not their understanding of evolution and natural selection.;"[Cofre, Hernan L.; Carmona, Francisca; Navarrete, Kasandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Santibanez, David P.] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Santibanez, David P.; Jimenez, Juan P.] IIT, Math & Sci Educ Dept, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Spotorno, Angel] Univ Chile, Fac Med Norte, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Claudia A.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile";;Cofre, HL (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile.;hernan.cofre@pucv.cl;;", hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457";Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1131029];This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT) [grant number 1131029].;;64;14;14;2;21;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0021-9266;2157-6009;;J BIOL EDUC;J.

Academic language might be one of the factors influencing the quality of written texts, given that prior research has shown its impact on reading comprehension. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of Spanish Core Academic Language Skills (S-CALS) and academic vocabulary to the quality of written argumentation and explanation. For this study, 126 Chilean 8th grade students produced an argumentative text and an explanatory text about the same topic. In addition, their academic vocabulary was assessed with the S-AVoc-T test and their CALS with the S-CALS-I test. Results show that both CALS and academic vocabulary are significantly and positively correlated with both writing tasks. Even though these instruments make different contributions to the predictive models in each discursive genre, a Principal Component Analysis revealed that the model that best explains writing quality are those which combine both language variables, namely Spanish Core Academic Language and Vocabulary Skills (S-CALVS). In argumentation, the S-CALVS model explains 29% of the variance, after controlling by gender. In contrast, in explanation, S-CALVS explains 35% of the variance. It is concluded that it is relevant to develop situated writing in each discursive genre and, upon that basis, to work with both CALS and academic vocabulary, because they have a specific impact on academic texts writing.;"[Figueroa, Javiera; Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Figueroa, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.;jfigueroami@uc.cl;"Chandia, Eugenio/ABH-9041-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017; Figueroa, Javiera/H-8181-2017";"Chandia, Eugenio/0000-0003-2489-1226; Figueroa, Javiera/0000-0003-1677-3932";"FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150238]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate [21130191]; Doctoral Program in Education, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile";This study was conducted as part of FONDECYT REGULAR Project number 1150238, funded by CONICYT, Chile, and a CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate/21130191 scholarship.

This work provides the evaluation of intervention in music and humanities (MH) on the general self-efficacy (study 1) and qualifications (study 2) of students from different schools in the Maule Region. The first study shows that the intervention generates changes in the participants' perception of efficacy, both over time and relative to a control group.

The tested model confirms the expected results but notes that self-efficacy does not show a significant direct effect on performance. Therefore, a second model is tested. We include self-efficacy as a predictor of academic engagement, eliminating the direct effect of this variable on performance. The results show a greater adjustment in the second model. It is concluded that: (a) positive emotions and autonomy support predict academic performance, self-efficacy and academic engagement; (b) self-efficacy predicts higher levels of academic engagement and the latter improves academic performance, and (c) indirect effects also show the existence of a mediation of these variables on the predictive relationship of autonomy support and positive emotions on performance.

Even less addressed it within the Chilean educational system. The specific objective of this study was to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of the vocabulary produced by Chilean 4th grade students. Based on a national writing survey, a sample of 2056 texts written by 685 students was collected (narrative, persuasive, and informative texts). Current literature defines lexical quality as a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. To represent the properties of the vocabulary, a set of indicators were selected: (a) lexical diversity; (b) lexical sophistication; and (c) lexical density. Using multilevel modeling (students and schools as levels 1 and 2) to explain a global writing score we found that diversity was a significant determinant for narrative and persuasive texts, density was a significant determinant for the three genres and sophistication was a significant determinant for narrative and expository text. In addition, indicators related to gender and socioeconomic conditions were only significant determinants of narrative stories. The parts of speech most often used also varied according to the purpose of each text. In all genres, words had a short extension and were very sensitive to the input presented in the stimuli. These results imply a significant challenge to this education system: how to promote the development of vocabulary in all children in order to support language learning.";"[Gomez Vera, Gabriela; Sotomayor, Carmen; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bedwell, Percy; Maria Dominguez, Ana] Arauco Fdn, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez Vera, Gabriela] Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;"Vera, GG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Vera, GG (corresponding author), Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.";gabriela.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez Vera, Gabriela/0000-0002-6842-3953;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy [79112008]";Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003 and CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy No. 79112008 are gratefully acknowledged.;;41;6;7;0;16;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0922-4777;1573-0905;;READ WRIT;Read.

However, the cognitive and linguistic skills that underlie online inference making remain elusive. The authors aimed to clarify the effects of vocabulary and text comprehension on word-to-text integration during reading. In a self-paced reading study, the authors measured participants' integration of words across sentence boundaries by comparing reading times at a critical word and the subsequent region, when preceded by the same critical word (repetition condition), by a lexically associated word (association condition), or by a word with no direct lexical link (inference condition). Furthermore, the authors assessed vocabulary knowledge, text comprehension, working memory, decoding, and fluid intelligence in the sample. Results showed that richer vocabulary was associated with immediate integration, as evidenced by reading time differences between the critical word and the subsequent word in the inference condition. Other individual differences did not predict self-paced reading times. Findings suggest that lexical knowledge plays a stronger role relative to other individual skills in online inference making and contributes to refining understanding of the mechanisms that underlie efficient reading.;"[Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Kronmueller, Edmundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;"Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile.";"ernesto.guerra@ciae.uchile.cl; ekr@uc.cl";;Guerra, Ernesto/0000-0001-7403-5271;"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT [11171074]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";"This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT No 11171074 to Ernesto Guerra.

Methods: Through an iterative process, an international group of 15 experts developed an initial set of learning outcomes following a review and discussion of relevant international and local literature. A two-round Delphi survey involving 46 experts from 8 countries was performed. Quantative and qualitative analisis permited the definition of the final consensus. Results: The initial proposal included 157 learning outcomes. The Delphi process generated 734 comments and involved the modification, deletion and addition of some outcomes. At the end of the process, a consensus was reached on 136 learning outcomes grouped under 6 competency domains with a high overall acceptance (95.1 %). Conclusions: The learning outcomes of this proposal provide a guide to introduce, support and develop communication curriculae for undergraduate medical studies in the countries involved or in other Spanish-or Portuguese-speaking countries.;"[Garcia de Leonardo, Cristina; Ruiz-Moral, Roger; Caballero, Fernando] Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Fac Med, Escuela Med, Edificio E,Ctra Pozuelo Majadahonda,Km 1,800, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Cavaco, Afonso] Univ Lisbon, Fac Farm, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Moore, Philippa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Paula Dupuy, Lila] Univ Maimonides, Fac Med, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pithon-Cyrino, Antonio] Univ Estadual Paulista, Fac Med, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Teresa Cortes, Ma] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Gorostegui, Marilen] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Loureiro, Elizabete] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Porto, Portugal; [Bosch Fontcuberta, Josep Ma] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Med, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Casasbuenas Duarte, Luis] Univ Antioquia, Fac Med, Medellin, Colombia; [Kretzer, Lara] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Fac Med, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Arrighi, Emilia] Univ Int Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Jovell, Albert] Spanish Patient Forum, Barcelona, Spain";;de Leonardo, CG (corresponding author), Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Fac Med, Escuela Med, Edificio E,Ctra Pozuelo Majadahonda,Km 1,800, Madrid 28223, Spain.;c.garcia.prof@ufv.es;"Cavaco, Afonso Miguel Neves/G-9298-2012; iMed.ULisboa, PEPSocPh/B-4101-2014; Cyrino, Antonio Pithon/P-3466-2017";"Cavaco, Afonso Miguel Neves/0000-0001-8466-0484; Cyrino, Antonio Pithon/0000-0002-9184-5927; Loureiro, Elizabete/0000-0003-1701-783X";Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (Madrid, Spain);They also want to thank the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (Madrid, Spain) the financial support for the achievement of the project.;;82;11;16;1;20;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1472-6920;;BMC MED EDUC;BMC Med.

This research aims to understand learners' sensorial perception of materials as stimuli and what constitutes the most appropriate communication channel for learning about their characteristics without losing information in accordance with their VAK learning styles-visual, auditory and kinaesthetic-. Seventy-five people participated in this workshop. Using evaluation tools in a test format, they evaluated all the sensory properties of the following materials: Alusion (TM), PolarMoss, and Silkworms. These three materials were presented in various interaction formats, called channels: a text plus image-C1-, video-C2-, and a physical sample plus audio-C3-. Two types of experiments were carried out: mixed per person-interaction with the three materials in a different channel each time in random order-and blocked per person-interaction with the same material in the three channels, in an order of C1-C3. The data obtained was analysed using mixed models with the channel as a fixed factor and the individuals and material as the random factors. The most relevant results indicate significant differences between channels in accordance with the sensory property, normally C2 and C3. The level of responses between the two experiments is similar, therefore showing that the order C1-C2-C3 does not affect perception. Although the three learning styles-visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic-coexist in the participants, the vast majority agree that they prefer C3 as easier to evaluate, more entertaining and the best way to learn.;"[Abella, Ainoa; Araya Leon, Maria; Cleries Garcia, Laura] ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain; [Abella, Ainoa; Marco-Almagro, Lluis] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain; [Araya Leon, Maria] Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile";;"Abella, A (corresponding author), ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain.; Abella, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain.";aabella@elisava.net;;"Marco-Almagro, Lluis/0000-0002-0440-1675; Abella, Ainoa/0000-0001-6375-0317; Araya Leon, Maria Jose/0000-0001-7284-6943";;;;29;0;0;1;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

This study analyzes the experiences of the first cohort of a national inclusive admissions program in Chile. Drawing from 45 in-depth interviews, it aims to understand how students perceive themselves and the obstacles they face, using academic literacy as a lens. Results show a recurring reproduction of dominant deficit discourses by the students, as they feel at a disadvantage and blame their previous education; additionally, negative self-perceptions are more frequent in students from the most competitive programs. Nevertheless, these perceptions contrast with student agency, resilience, and self-sponsored strategies that emerged in the interviews as resources for making sense of university, an unforeseen environment for the participants and their families. Furthermore, interviews reveal that these students face additional challenges pertaining to adverse material conditions that shape their university experience, such as commuting extremely long distances or working for a living. Overall, this research depicts a complex picture of intertwined factors that challenges the deficit framework and should be considered in developing equitable admissions policies.

Its appearance during the first years of schooling is linked to school failure and dropout, violent behaviors, mental health problems, and maladaptive trajectories that persist for the rest of an individual's life. The goal of this study was to identify psychosocial adversity variables capable of predicting the appearance of SM during the first three years of school. By collecting data on school maladjustment, adverse childhood experiences and psychosocial dysfunction, a longitudinal follow-up process was applied to a cohort of 26,108 Chilean students (50.7% female) from the start of their schooling (6.3 years of age in 1st grade) until two years later (8.4 year age mean in 3st grade). Through binary logistic regressions, the results obtained show that mother's adolescent pregnancy, biological father's absence, mental pathology in a relative, psychosocial dysfunction, and teacher's negative perception of students' academic and behavioral performance predict the appearance of SM after three years in the school system.

The purpose of this study is to identify and describe different school climate profiles by evaluating variables at the individual, family and community levels in Chilean students. The sample consists of 2,683 adolescent students (51.2% men and 48.8% women), aged between 12 and 20 years (M = 15.78, SD = 1.35), and from 32 Chilean educational institutions. Results obtained from a multilevel latent class cluster analysis show that the model with six clusters of students and two class of institutions proves to be the most parsimonious model and with the best fit to the data. School climate profiles were built on the basis of four indicators: school climate (Wald = 301.065, p < .001), student-teacher relationships (Wald = 226.687, p < .001), positive attitude towards authority (Wald = 115.591, p < .001) and positive attitude towards norm transgression (Wald = 3705.593, p < .001). All of them are to be useful indicators for profile segmentation. Covariates that are associated with school climate profiles identified: at the individual level, age (p = .019) and sex (p < .001); at the family level, family structure (p < .001); at the school level, type of educational institution (p = .002); and at the community level, the perception of insecurity in the neighborhood (p = .011), social control (p = .002) and support (p < .001).

In order to do this, the present study is aimed at assessing the psychometric properties of the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation, an interview for teachers that measures school adjustment difficulties. The study evaluated 10,287 adolescents participating in a Chilean public program for improving mental health in schools. Of the total sample, 5,815 (56.5%) students were in 6th grade and were 12.91 years old on average (SD= 1391). Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify four dimensions (behavioral, learning, social, and autonomy-related difficulties), which were tested using structural equations. Reliability analyses show that all factors have high levels of internal consistency and differ according to age, grade, and extreme poverty.

The number of participants was 548 teachers, male and female, aged between 28 and 60. The instrument used was an adaptation of the Index for Inclusion created by Booth and Ainscow. The results show six factors: teaching for learning for all, building an inclusive community, curricular design for diversity, school policies for diversity, inclusive practices in schools, and development of a culture for inclusion. These dimensions were clustered into three new factors, namely, pedagogical practices, inclusive cultures, and inclusive policies.

Children (N = 81) first viewed a narrative picture sequence and then completed the narrative production task in each of two orders: either before or after answering a set of questions about the core elements of the story. Narratives elicited after questions were more coherent than those produced before the questions. In contrast, task order did not influence the cohesion of narratives nor the accuracy of responses to questions. An independent measure of memory was related to the gains in narrative coherence after answering questions. The results are discussed in relation to the role of questions as a guide to the structural elements of a narrative and a scaffold for understanding.;"[Silva, Macarena; Cain, Kate] Univ Lancaster, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, England; [Silva, Macarena] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Silva, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;macarena.silva@ciae.uchile.cl;"Silva, Macarena/C-7701-2014; , CIAE/R-5423-2017";"Silva, Macarena/0000-0002-5830-0837; Cain, Kate/0000-0003-2780-188X";"Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT [FB 0003]; Conicyt-Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140887]";This project has been possible through Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB 0003, from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT and Conicyt-Fondecyt Project No 11140887.;;52;7;8;1;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0141-0423;1467-9817;;J RES READ;J.

The indirect effect of contextual variables (Family, Teachers and Classmates) on the dependent variables thru school engagement. A sample of 1170 students of 12 to 17 years old was used. Two questionnaires are answered by every student to assess school engagement and contextual variables. Information about school performance and percentage of attendance to classes is provided by holders of municipal schools. School engagement is considered as conformed by three subtypes of engagements (affective, cognitive and behavioural). Structural equation modelling is performed to determine the fit of model to data. The mediation model proposed presented a good fit (RMSEA=.045; CFI =.944, TLI =.940). Cognitive engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on school performance. Affective engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on attendance to classes. School engagement is a variable to consider affecting the dependent variables school performance and attendance to classes. An important issue is that School engagement and contextual variables are modifiable aspects of a student life. Because of that, intervention programs who seek to improve the school performance could consider it. (C) 2018 Universidad de Pais Vasco. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

The participants were 152 fourth-grade students selected from three schools that were grouped in four classrooms. Each classroom was divided in two groupsgraphic organizer and content-based. The graphic organizer group was taught using an 11-slide PowerPoint presentation on a social study topic that included two empty graphic organizers plus two additional slides explaining how to make a comparison. The content-based group was taught using the same presentation but without these additional slides plus a set of questions students had to answer as a class activity. The lessons were recorded and the verbal statements between instructor and students examined using the Flanders Interaction Analysis System. Results indicated significant differences in how instructors and students interacted in each group, including more questions asked by teachers (d = 1.99) and more students participating in the classroom discussion in the graphic organizer group (d = 1.76). Learning outcomes showed that the graphic organizer group outperformed the content-based group on a memory test (d = .45) and a comprehension test (d = .44).

Trained in different design education systems, these professionals can have different conceptual understandings about design. Recognizing and identifying these differences are key issues for establishing shared design practices within the educational community. Contributing to this understanding, we examined whether and how two different populations of students have different knowledge structures with respect to HCI design. We adopted the romantic, conservative and pragmatic dimensions, previously investigated in the related research, to elucidate those differences. This paper compares one specific type of design artefact-conceptual frameworks-created by groups of students with different educational backgrounds: Arts and Engineering. It was based on a set of 22 criteria divided by two main domains: scheme (addressing form) and realm (focusing on contents). The obtained results show that students with background in Engineering (1) focus more on the product of design; (2) rely less on conceptual frameworks to guide the design process; and (3) produce artefacts that are more constrained in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, definition of a symbolic system, and information organization and shaping. We suggest that conceptual frameworks serve to communicate and understand design practice. We note that Engineering students seem to be more susceptible to fixation than Arts students and suggest that an emphasis of reflection-in-action could help compensating this problem.";"[Antunes, Pedro] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Xiao, Lu] Univ Western Ontario, Fac Informat & Media Studies, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Pino, Jose A.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;Antunes, P (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.;"pedro.antunes@vuw.ac.nz; lxiao24@uwo.ca; jpino@dcc.uchile.cl";"Pino, Jose/G-6404-2016; Antunes, Pedro A/B-8664-2008; Xiao, Lu/O-8014-2016";"Pino, Jose/0000-0002-8466-6453; Antunes, Pedro A/0000-0002-5411-8798; Xiao, Lu/0000-0001-5420-1578";;;;32;5;5;1;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

First, the Magellan-Leiden Childcare Study (MLCS) used a sample of 95 mothers with children younger than 1year old (n=36 in day care). Second, we partially cross-validated our results in a large and representative sample of 10,723 mothers and their children from the Chilean Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia (Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey). In both studies, the quality of care for children provided at home was measured with the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. In the MLCS study, additional indicators of the mother-child relationship were measured. Day care was not negatively associated with the mother-child relationship and maternal sensitivity, compared to maternal care, or with the quality of the home environment. Positive changes in attachment security were found in Mapuche children who attended day care centers. Practice or Policy: We were able to confirm that type of care was not differentially associated with quality of the home environment.;"[Carcamo, Rodrigo A.] Univ Magallanes, Dept Psychol, Ave Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile; [Carcamo, Rodrigo A.; Vermeer, Harriet J.; van der Veer, Rene; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H.] Leiden Univ, Ctr Child & Family Studies, Leiden, Netherlands";;Carcamo, RA (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, Dept Psychol, Ave Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile.;rodrigo.carcamo@umag.cl;"van IJzendoorn, Marinus/P-4907-2019; carcamo, rodrigo/AAB-5231-2020";"van IJzendoorn, Marinus/0000-0003-1144-454X; Carcamo, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9227-7132";"National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research CONICYT, Chile (Becas Chile); FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140663]";This study was made possible by a grant awarded to the first author by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research CONICYT, Chile (Becas Chile) and FONDECYT 11140663.

Two predominant hypotheses have been developed in this regard: 1) difficulties in arithmetic appear due to a deficit in domain-specific skills (numerical skills) and 2) there is a strong relationship between the development of the domain-general processes and arithmetical skills. In this study we explore the specific contribution of orienting and executive control attentional networks to individual variability in basic mental arithmetic. Participants were elementary school children, from second to third grade, with and without difficulties in basic mental arithmetic. Results provide support for the two proposed hypotheses. Children with difficulties in arithmetic showed difficulties both in numerical skills and in attentional networks. These findings suggest that arithmetic difficulties may be associated with a heterogeneous combination of deficits, including difficulties in attentional functioning.;"[Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile; [Kettlun Poblete, Rocio] Univ Desarrollo, Concepcion, Bio Bio, Chile; [Estevez Perez, Nancy] Ctr Neurociencias Cuba, Dept Neurodesarrollo Infantil, Havana, Cuba";;"Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.; Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile.";danilka.castro@umayor.cl;;;"National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF) [ID18I10002]";Funding: This research was funded by two grants from the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence (Grant FB0003), and The Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF, Grant ID18I10002).

Children, fathers, and mothers exhibited stereotypes that link math with males. More specifically, mothers identified more with language than with math, while fathers and children identified more with math than with language. Path analyses models revealed that children's explicit math self-concepts significantly predicted their actual math achievement. Children's explicit self-concept was, in turn, explained marginally by the mathematical anxiety of their mothers.Practice or Policy: These results contribute to our understanding of the relation between parental and children's beliefs and children's math achievement during early elementary school years. In countries such as Chile, with a significant gender gap in math achievement, these findings may highlight relevant aspects to consider when designing interventions aimed at educational equity and providing equal mathematical learning opportunities to boys and girls.;"[del Rio, M.

Elements of coherence were assessed in both tasks, namely problem, resolution, and mental-states. The findings indicate that questions can scaffold the production of more coherent narratives. Narratives elicited after questions were judged to be more coherent than those produced before the question-answering task. In contrast, there were no differences between scores for the question answers in the different order conditions.

This study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, executive functions (EFs), quality of the home environment, quantity of maternal care, and quality and quantity of professional childcare as predictors of five-year-old preschoolers' problem behavior, prosocial behavior, and language ability in 77 low-SES families with a Chilean majority or Mapuche minority background in Chile. Executive functions and the quality of the home environment were positively associated with language ability, whereas quantity of childcare was inversely related to children's language ability. All other associations were non-significant. The results corroborate the vital roles of child executive functioning and stimulating and responsive parenting in child language ability in a Latin-American context. Furthermore, our findings revealed inadequate preschool classroom quality and provide new evidence from southern Chile of the urgent need to improve the quality of Chilean children's preprimary education as a catalyst for reducing social disparities.

However, few studies have described how different infant care experiences may relate to later child cognitive, language and motor functioning, and most analyses have focused on samples from historically industrialized regions. Cognitive, language and motor subscores (TEPSI) and receptive vocabulary scores (TVIP) obtained through direct testing of 24-to-48-month-old children (n = 7564) from the Chilean Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood were compared based on retrospective reports of care received as infants. Children who, as infants, had received one of four types of non-maternal care - center-based, grandparent, other relative, and non-relative care - were compared to those who had exclusively experienced maternal care (71.8%). Series of regressions with propensity score models (PSM) were performed. Compared to maternal care, children in center-based care and grandparent care had higher total TEPSI scores (d = .19, p < 0.05) (d = .19, p < 0.01) and TEPSI language subscores (d = .20, p < 0.05) (d = .20, p < 0.01), while those in grandparent care also had higher TEPSI motor subscores (d=.08, p < 0.05). In contrast, children in nonrelative care had lower TVIP receptive vocabulary scores (d= -.38, p < 0.01). These findings contribute to the debate on national policies supporting specific types of non-maternal care and their impact on child development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The focus of our inquiry is on Chile, one of the most economically unequal coun-tries in the world. We use data from the Longitudinal Early Childhood Survey conducted in 2010 and 2012, which contains information regarding infants aged 30 months on average ( n = 8,251). Early child-hood stimulation is examined using a multidimensional index that comprises three domains: caregivers' stimulation of cognitive-language, sensorimotor, and socio-emotional development. Our dynamic models show that the main factors that lead to less stimulation are low caregiver education, low-income house-holds, and large families. Specifically, it was found that an additional child being born within a two-year period decreases stimulation, indicating possible competition between siblings due to time and resource restrictions in the household. Furthermore, caregivers' performance in personality (BFI) and linguistic in-telligence (WAIS language) tests was found to be a more significant factor than operational memory. Taken together, these findings suggest the need for initiatives aimed at increasing equality in early child-hood stimulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The sensory modality used for learning affects grades. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 270-274, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00010.2011.-Second-year undergraduated students from 2008, 2009, and 2010 cohorts were asked to respond a questionnaire to determine their learning style preferences, the VARK questionnaire (where V is visual, A is aural, R is reading-writing, and K is kinesthetic), which was translated into Spanish by the author. The translated questionnaire was tested for wording comprehension before its application in the actual study. Using the results of the VARK questionnaire, students were classified as unimodal or multimodal and according to the first preferred sensory modality used for learning as V, A, R, or K learners. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and problems that required simple arithmetic calculations (arithmetic-type questions) were applied to the students. The relation between the main sensory modality used for learning and the grades obtained in each question type was analyzed both in unimodal and multimodal students. It was found that R unimodal students performed significantly better in arithmetic questions than A and K unimodal students (P < 0.001 by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test after ANOVA). R unimodal students also performed better than R multimodal students in arithmetic questions (P = 0.02 by a Mann-Whitney U-test). However, no differences were observed after MCQs in either unimodal or multimodal students with different first sensory modalities used for learning. When MCQ scores between unimodal and multimodal students were compared, no differences were detected. It was concluded that the sensory learning style used for learning affects student outcome when students receive arithmetic questions but not when MCQs are applied.";Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile;;Ramirez, BU (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Alameda 3363, Santiago, Chile.;beatriz.ramirez@usach.cl;;;Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [030801-RU];This work was funded by Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica Grant 030801-RU.;;22;19;20;0;14;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = iNP(o), where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and P-o the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and P-o (max) (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth FJ. G Gen Physiol 307: 97-129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at www.cecs.cl).;"Ctr Estudios Cient, Valdivia, Chile; Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santiago 6850240, Chile";;Latorre, R (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios Cient, Ave Arturo Prat 514, Valdivia, Chile.;;"Alvarez, Osvaldo/I-1077-2013; Tuluc, Petronel/C-2527-2011";"Alvarez, Osvaldo/0000-0001-8558-580X; ";;;;20;78;78;0;13;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

In some studies, a sex effect has been reported. Lectures are a teacher-centered learning activity. Therefore, it appeared interesting to evaluate if a stronger correlation between attendance and grades would occur in a face-to-face evidence-based medicine course with few lectures and more time dedicated to active learning methods. Small-group work and peer learning were used to foster deep learning and to engage students in their own learning process. Most of the time, students worked in small groups solving contextualized problems and critically analyzing the quality of published medical literature. Peer learning was also developed in collaborative evaluations, and constant feedback was provided. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high attenders would develop a higher self-perception of learning and obtain higher marks than low attenders. Student self-perceptions of their capacity to apply evidence-based medicine were measured by the application of an online self-assessment survey, and objective learning was measured as the grades obtained in a final accumulative individual test. It was found that male students obtained higher grades and were more confident in their achievements than their female peers, despite male and female student attendance being similar. In addition, attendance was correlated with the perceived capacity to apply evidence-based medicine only in male students and was not correlated with academic outcome.;[Ramirez, Beatriz U.] Univ Santiago Chile Usach, Fac Med Sci, Santiago, Chile;;Ramirez, BU (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Escuela Med, Fac Ciencias Med, Estac Cent, Alameda 3363, Santiago 9170019, Chile.;beatriz.ramirez@usach.cl;;;;;;22;7;9;0;16;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

First, we analyzed the levels of resilience and internalized problems (defined as group of emotional symptoms) in children aged 9 to 12 years. Second, we examined whether the relationship between them varies according to the low or high vulnerability of school communities. METHODS About 1460 students from schools in northern Chile participated. A total of 52.6% were girls, and 47.4% were boys. The scales of internalizing problems of the System of Evaluation of Children and Adolescents (SENA) and the short scale of resilience (CYRM-12) were applied. Correlations in each group and differences between groups were analyzed using a MANOVA. A 2-level path analysis was also performed. RESULTS Resilience was higher in the context of low vulnerability while depression, social anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptomatology were greater in the context of high vulnerability. A 2-level path analysis showed that the slope of gender, anxiety, and depression symptomatology varies between schools and an interaction effect between vulnerability and anxiety symptomatology. CONCLUSION There are differences in the relationship between internalized problems and resilience according to whether the students belong to low or high vulnerability establishments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between internalizing problems and resilience.;"[Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Caqueo-Urizar, Alejandra] Univ Tarapaca, Inst Alta Invest, Calle Antofagasta 1520, Arica, Chile";;"Flores, J (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.; Flores, J (corresponding author), CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.";"jflores@uta.cl; acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl; cristianramirezvallejos@gmail.com; diaz.patricia.psicologia@gmail.com; claudiafernandad.t@hotmail.com; lorenalopezreyes@gmail.com";;; [PIACIE160007];This research was funded by ANID PIACIE160007.;;46;0;0;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-4391;1746-1561;;J SCHOOL HEALTH;J.

In men, we expect physical aggression (PA) and sociality to be negative predictors of academic performance. However, in women, PA would be a negative predictor of academic performance, and sociality a positive one. Our results report a negative association between academic performance and PA in both sexes. As we expected, social effect derived from the use of PA seems to be different for each sex, where men could display a rebellious attitude to increase chances of finding a mate. In contrast, results for women are not conclusive, because no relationship between academic performance and any aggressive mechanism, were predicted by sociality. We conclude that an evolutionary framework, which includes sex-specific hypotheses, is appropriate to obtain a holistic perspective of this phenomenon.;"[Munoz Reyes, Jose Antonio; Polo, Pablo; Cavieres, Eduardo] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Valparaiso, Chile; [Guerra, Romulo] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Direcc Postgrad, Santiago, Chile; [Pita, Miguel; Turiegano, Enrique] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain";;Reyes, JAM (corresponding author), Calle Traslavina 450, Vina Del Mar, Region De Valpa, Chile.;jose.munoz-cea@upla.cl;"Pita, Miguel/AAA-6505-2019; Pita, Miguel/L-2466-2013; Munoz-Reyes, Jose Antonio/D-2822-2012";"Pita, Miguel/0000-0001-5106-5566; Pita, Miguel/0000-0001-5106-5566; Munoz-Reyes, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-6275-8456";;;;48;1;1;0;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1538-8220;1538-8239;;J SCH VIOLENCE;J.

Quantitatively, each article's edit history was analyzed by Wikipedia X-tools, references and media were counted manually, and two readability indices were used to evaluate article readability. This analysis revealed that each article was updated 8.3 +/- 6.8 times per month, and referenced with 33.5 +/- 24.3 sources, such as journal articles and textbooks. Each article contained on average 14.0 +/- 7.6 media items. The readability indices including: (1) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Test and (2) Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula demonstrated that the articles had low readability and were more appropriate for college students and above. Qualitatively, the sampled articles were evaluated by experts using a modified DISCERN survey. According to the modified DISCERN, 13 articles (32.5%), 24 articles (60%), 3 articles (7.5%), were rated as good, moderate, and poor, respectively. There were positive correlations between the DISCERN score and the number of edits (r = 0.537), number of editors (r = 0.560), and article length (r = 0.536). Strengths reported by the panel included completeness and coverage in 11 articles (27.5%), anatomical details in 10 articles (25%), and clinical details in 5 articles (12.5%). The panel also noted areas which could be improved, such as providing missing information in 28 articles (70%), inaccuracies in 10 articles (25%), and lack or poor use of images in 17 articles (42.5%). In conclusion, this study revealed that many Wikipedia anatomy articles were difficult to read. Each article's quality was dependent on edit frequency and article length. Learners and students should be cautious when using Wikipedia articles for anatomy education due to these limitations.;"[Suwannakhan, Athikhun; Yurasakpong, Laphatrada; Meemon, Krai] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Anat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Casanova-Martinez, Daniel] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Med, Morphol Unit, San Felipe, Chile; [Montriwat, Punchalee] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Biol & Biol Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Limpanuparb, Taweetham] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand";;Limpanuparb, T (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;taweetham.lim@mahidol.edu;"Limpanuparb, Taweetham/A-6295-2011; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAA-1024-2020; Meemon, Krai/C-3803-2015; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAH-4643-2019";"Limpanuparb, Taweetham/0000-0002-8558-6199; Meemon, Krai/0000-0001-5700-2646; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/0000-0001-9910-0244";Wikimedia Foundation [PHD/0087/2560];The authors wish to thank the three anonymous experts who volunteered to participate in our study.

In this article, we generalize this problem to an arbitrary surface, including the effects of friction, and provide a general expression to determine under what conditions a particle will leave the surface. An explicit integral form for the speed is given, which is analytically integrable for some cases. We demonstrate general criteria to determine the critical speed at which the particle immediately leaves the surface. Three curves, a circle, a cycloid, and a catenary, are analyzed in detail, revealing several interesting features.

The bound state probability profile decays exponentially away from the origin, with a profile width that increases monotonically with alpha, becoming an almost completely extended state when alpha-->2(-). At alpha =2, the bound state suffers a discontinuous change to a delta function-like profile. A further increase of a increases the width of the probability profile, although the bound state is stable only for alpha <2. The transmission of plane waves across the potential increases monotonically with <alpha> and is insensitive to the sign of the opacity Omega.

J;"Palma, G; Raff, U";;;;"Palma, Guillermo; Raff, Ulrich";;;A novel application of a Fourier integral representation of bound states in quantum mechanics;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;HARMONIC-OSCILLATOR;A method is developed to find the bound state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one-dimensional and rotational symmetric three-dimensional quantum mechanical problems. The method is based on the fact that eigenfunctions of bound states are square integrable. We use this property and a judicious ansatz inspired on its asymptotic behavior to obtain a differential equation that can be solved straightforwardly using a Fourier transform. The main advantage of the method is that it avoids the traditional and tedious convergence analysis using a series representation. The method leads to an integral representation of the wave function and provides insight into concepts such as energy quantization, spectrum degeneracy, and bound states.

For this, the use of kinetic impact projectiles and the actual data provided by official sources are considered. This information is used in an object motion model describing the kinematic characteristics of a spherical projectile (a rubber bullet). For these purposes, a Reynolds number Re >> 1 was used, which allows one to apply a nonlinear motion equation to find the velocity and impact energy per unit area of a projectile. The results and analysis of this model can generate an interesting discussion in the classroom about the need to build protocols for the use of kinetic impact projectiles, and the importance of using scientific knowledge in social conflicts.;"[Hernandez, Carla] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Chile; [Echiburu, Mauricio] Univ Vina del Mar, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Vina Del Mar 2572007, Chile; [Humire, Fernando; Mosso, Edward] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fis, Arica, Chile";;Hernandez, C (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Chile.;carla.hernandez.s@usach.cl;;"Humire, Fernando/0000-0002-8054-3149; Hernandez-Silva, Carla/0000-0003-2974-4989";Convenio Marco Formacion Inicial Docente [UTA 1856];E Mosso was supported by Convenio Marco Formacion Inicial Docente, UTA 1856.;;29;0;0;1;7;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

It is shown that if the charge distribution decreases faster than the square of the distance when \r\ goes to infinity, the convolution integral defining the potential exists, goes to zero as \r\ goes to infinity, and therefore allows the calculation of the electric potential function at any point in space, even if the total charge is infinite. We illustrate the calculation of the electric potential with a simple example of a spherically symmetric infinite charge distribution.

Students can follow visually the actual transfer of the reagent by the catalyst, and its consumption in the organic phase, in a step-by-step process that employs a colored charge-transfer (CT) complex as the transferred reacting species. Consumption of the transferred nucleophile is followed by discoloration of the organic phase. This transfer-consumption cycle can be repeated several times by shaking the two separated phases again, allowing students to finally grasp the whole process as a continuous repetition of these cycles. The experiment also links, through visualization, the important synthetic tool of PTC with abstract concepts based on molecular-orbital and hard-soft acid-base theories, invoked in the formation of a CT complex.;"[Caroli Rezende, Marcos; Aliaga, Carolina; Vidal, Matias] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile; [Aliaga, Carolina] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Nanociencia & Nanotecnol CEDENNNA, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile; [Barriga, German] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Avda Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Santiago 7760197, Chile";;Rezende, MC (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile.;marcos.caroli@usach.cl;"Caroli, Marcos/H-3570-2019; Aliaga, Carolina/G-6024-2019";"Aliaga, Carolina/0000-0002-1352-3164; Rezende, Marcos/0000-0003-2040-9009; Barriga-Gonzalez, German/0000-0002-9628-2414";"Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140212]; Project USA [1555-VRIDEI-USACH]; CEDENNA [PB0807]";M.C.R. thanks Fondecyt Project 1140212, and G.B. and M.V. thank Project USA 1555-VRIDEI-USACH for research grants.

The University of Chile has considered, since 1997, the internship as one of the final activities in the pharmacy curriculum. In 1998, some modifications were made in the objectives and contents of this final activity. The purpose of these modifications was to include and develop the concept of pharmaceutical care. The present study shows some results obtained through these modifications. Between 1998 and 2000, 187 students completed the new internship experience. Of this total, 143 (76.5 percent), worked directly with patients, with a maximum of 80.6 percent (50 students) in the year 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, 118 students (63 percent) preferred to have these practice experiences at adult and children's hospitals. Changes in the internship motivated students to formulate and to develop pharmaceutical care plans. This new type of internship has been evaluated as a very stimulating activity.;Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Quim & Farmaceut, Dept Ciencias & Tecnol Farmaceut, Santiago, Chile;;Ruiz, I (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Quim & Farmaceut, Dept Ciencias & Tecnol Farmaceut, Casilla 233, Santiago, Chile.;;;"Paulos, Claudio/0000-0002-9857-0567; Mellado, Rosemarie/0000-0002-9569-5057";;;;1;5;5;0;3;AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY;ALEXANDRIA;1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA;0002-9459;;;AM J PHARM EDUC;Am.

To design and evaluate a practical activity for teaching the operation and control of a plant for purified water production. Design. A practical activity using a distilled water production plant was developed; physicochemical parameters of the water were measured at different sampling points; the students of Unit Operations course were given a questionnaire and a survey on the design and contents of the practical activity. Assessment. Seventy percent of the students were able to explain the USP requirements for purified water, to decide how to choose the sampling points, and to evaluate the plant operation performance. Fifty-three percent of the students could establish the specific purification capability and limitations of the deionization step, but only 26% were able of proposing corrective actions in the case of failure of some of the system's parameters. Conclusion. The students' opinion regarding the practical activity and the design of the laboratory guide was positive. Four out of five objectives were reached, and future work is necessary for the students to be able to propose corrective action plans in the case of failure of the system's parameters.";"[Tapia, C.; Sapag-Hagar, J.; Lopez, L.; Zunino, G.

J;"Rivera, R; Villarroel, D";;;;"Rivera, R; Villarroel, D";;;Synchrotron radiation and symmetries;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;The total power of radiation emitted by a monoenergetic electron in circular orbit is derived by calculating the instantaneous energy flux of the electron field across the surfaces of spheres and tori that enclose the orbit. These surfaces are such that the positions of the electron at different times are indistinguishable with respect to them, which in turn permits the choice of special spheres and tori that greatly simplify the calculations. The total power of radiation of an electron is usually derived in textbooks with the help of the relativistic formalism. But for the particular motion in a synchrotron, the total power of radiation is obtained here working in the ordinary three-dimensional physical space, where the calculations are conceptually easier to follow than in Minskowski space, especially for students who are taking a first course of electrodynamics.

During the last decades, new educational paradigms and didactic strategies have arisen. Nevertheless, it was not always the case that engineering educators had a clear understanding of a paradigm or a strategy being used.

The CD-ROM has five main themes. Three of them correspond to the main types of pharmaceutical products which are manufactured in the pharmaceutical industry, another is dedicated to the services necessary for the pharmaceutical production, and the last one is a library with web directions. The conceptual development of the navigation tree design begins with the known elements (pharmaceutical dosage form or service) and then going to the manufacture process (diagram of flowsheet process), and finally to the specific unit operation used in the process. A self-evaluation section was developed which allows the student to evaluate his/her knowledge by facing practical situations (multiple choice questions), designing process of multiple steps (puzzles), and developing calculations skills by solving exercises based on common situations on the pharmaceutical industry.;"Univ Chile, Fac Chem & Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Unit Operat, Santiago 1, Chile; Lab Bago, Santiago, Chile";;Tapia, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Chem & Pharmaceut Sci, Lab Unit Operat, POB 233, Santiago 1, Chile.;;"tapia, cristian/J-3615-2014; Basualto, Carlos/D-8651-2014";"tapia, cristian/0000-0003-0151-6829; Basualto, Carlos/0000-0002-6808-8331";;;;15;2;2;0;3;AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY;ALEXANDRIA;1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA;0002-9459;;;AM J PHARM EDUC;Am.

The solution is obtained in closed form and resembles the solution of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates. Due to the existence of a singularity at the origin and the absence of tunneling, this one-dimensional system has a twofold degeneracy. Therefore, the nondegeneracy of the eigenvalues breaks down as has been observed in other systems.

This empathic ability can be extended to other species, based on the human ability to develop techniques to understand and communicate with animals. In education, the benefits of training professionals with ethical and empathic tools are known. Gender, diet, past experiences, and other factors can modify a person's levels of empathy toward humans and animals, and a relationship exists between both types of empathy. The aims of this study were to investigate some determinants of the level of empathy and to gain insight into the possible correlation between human-animal and human-human empathy. For this, the Animal Empathy Scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index by Davis were applied through an electronic survey system to freshmen and final-year students (n = 452) from five schools of veterinary medicine in Chile. The correlation between the empathy scores of both instruments and their association with individual factors were studied using Spearman's correlation, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results suggest that both instruments correlate significantly, and that gender, year of study, diet, and area of interest have a significant association with the score for empathy toward animals. This research shows that individual characteristics and changes that occur during veterinary training can affect students' attitudes toward animals.;"[Calderon-Amor, Javiera] Univ Austral Chile, Anim Sci Program, Valdivia, Chile; [Luna-Fernandez, Daniela] Univ Chile, Ciencias Silvoagr & Veterinarias Program, Santiago, Chile; [Tadich, Tamara] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile";;Tadich, T (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile.;tamaratadich@u.uchile.cl;"Tadich, Tamara A/H-9753-2013; Tadich, Tamara/U-6154-2019; Luna, Daniela/H-5312-2013";"Tadich, Tamara A/0000-0003-1620-7770; Tadich, Tamara/0000-0003-1620-7770; Luna, Daniela/0000-0002-7229-3194; Calderon-Amor, Javiera/0000-0003-4183-2260";;;;65;13;14;1;42;UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC;TORONTO;JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA;0748-321X;1943-7218;;J VET MED EDUC;J.

Whereas most of the debate tends to focus on core contents of nursing programmes, little has been discussed about the teaching in 'supporting subjects' with relevance to both nursing education and nursing practice. This article offers a perspective on sociology scholarship for applied professions by using the case of nursing programmes. Methodology: Syllabus is a rich source of data, and in its representational capacity it becomes both a discursive construction and a vehicle of ideology. Accordingly, we present a Critical Discourse Analysis of syllabi of nursing schools in Chile as to identify core contents and ideologies, and implied challenges for nursing education. Findings and discussion: We argue that while the syllabus as a discourse discloses a significant cleavage, the biggest challenge is precisely to challenge the ideologies constructed by and embedded in the syllabi. Our reflection thus points to a better interdisciplinary dialogue as to enhance the actual contribution of sociology to nursing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the first microscopes of the epoch was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, a deceptively simple device that contains a single ball lens housed in a metal plate allowing the observation of samples at up to x250 magnification. Such magnification was much greater than that achieved by rudimentary compound microscopes of the era, allowing for the discovery of microscopic, single-celled life, an achievement that marked the study of biology up to the nineteenth century. Since Leeuwenhoek's design uses a single ball lens, it is possible to fabricate variations for educational activities in physics and biology university and high school classrooms. A fundamental problem, however, with home-built microscopes is that it is difficult to work with glass. We developed a simple protocol to make ball lenses of glass and gelatin with high magnification that can be done in a university/high school classroom, and we designed an optimized support for focusing and taking photographs with a smartphone. The protocol details a simple, easily accessible, low-cost, and effective tool for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere without the need for a laboratory or complex tools. Our protocol has been implemented in classrooms in Chile to a favorable reception.;"[Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Lab Ontogeny & Phylogeny, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Fdn Interdisciplinary Dev Sci Technol & Arts, DICTA, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Med, MicroMundo Project, Santiago, Chile; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile";;"Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.; Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile.";tim@backyardbrains.com;;Flores, Daniela/0000-0002-8542-0279;"Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant; Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional [2019-21191885]; Chile ANID Project [ACT-1720099]; National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant [2R44 MH-093334]";Funding for the development of this activity was provided by Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant, a national PhD scholarship from the Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional/2019-21191885, Chile ANID Project ACT-1720099, and National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant 2R44 MH-093334: Backyard Brains: Bringing Neurophysiology into Secondary Schools.;;32;1;1;2;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;Rockville;6120 Executive Blvd, Suite 600, Rockville, MD, UNITED STATES;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect and associated factors involved in an intensive course for learning advanced laparoscopic skills, which include validated teaching techniques. METHODS: General surgeons and final-year residents were analyzed after completing an intensive 5-session advanced laparoscopy course. Initial (IA) and final assessment (FA) consisted in performing a jejunojejunal anastomosis in a live porcine model, measured using objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) (GRS and SRS, that is, global rating scale and specific rating scale, respectively) and operative time (OT). The 3-session training was structured in a bench model with an ex vivo bowel. For the demographic analysis, 3 groups were defined according to the presentation of relevant changes in OSATS and in OT between IA and FA: group A, no changes; group B, change in 1 variable; and group C, change in both variables. RESULTS: After the course, all 114 participants presented a significant improvement in OT (37 vs 24.6 min, p < 0.001) and in OSATS; global rating scale (10.5 vs 16 points; p < 0.001) and Specific Rating Scale (8.5 vs 12.7 points; p < 0.001). In the IA, 70 (61%) participants completed the jejunojejunal anastomosis and 105(92%) in the FA (p < 0.01). In the FA, 56% of participants presented relevant changes in both variables (group C). This group was significantly younger (34 vs 45 vs 40 y old; p < 0.001), had fewer years of surgical experience (2 vs 9 vs 5 y; p < 0.001), and had a proportionally higher concentration of residents (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This intensive course is set out as a viable alternative to teach basic skills in advanced laparoscopy in a short period of time, which is ideal for surgeons with difficult access to training centers. It remains necessary to establish the participant profile for which this type of course is most beneficial.

This paper reveals significant limitations in the functioning, performance and productivity of the Senate, consistent with the evidence reported by the related literature. Our study suggests that these deficiencies are associated with (i) the institutional design and organisation of the Senate, (ii) ambiguity (legal and practical) in respect of its authority, (iii) structural discord with other governing bodies of the university and (iv) lack of legitimacy and recognition of the Senate by other governing bodies and the university community in general, consistent with the observed lack of electoral support and representation of its members.;"[Nunez, Javier; Leiva, Benjamin] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;Nunez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;jnunez@fen.uchile.cl;;;;;;26;2;2;3;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-764X;1469-3577;;CAMB J EDUC;Camb.

It first provides some contextual information on the development of Chilean teacher education in the aftermath of the military dictatorship period (1973-1990) and of a research base within its institutions. Then it centres on how future teachers from 11 teacher education programmes report on their learning and growth processes before and after their final practicum, and refer to the contextual effects of school placement on these processes. To this end, questionnaires before and after the practicum experience were administered to an initial group of 152 future teachers and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 of these teachers as well as one observation in their classrooms and schools. The key elements examined were motivation, pedagogical satisfaction and self-efficacy, as well as conditions of practicum and teacher assessment of its effect on learning and commitment to teaching.;"[Avalos, Beatrice] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bascope, Martin] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Avalos, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.;bavalos@terra.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;;;;;36;7;8;0;23;UNISA PRESS;PRETORIA;PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA;1682-3206;1947-9417;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

Some argue that school franchises offer educational services more effectively than small independent schools. Skeptics counter that large centralized operations create hard-to-manage bureaucracies and foster diseconomies of scale and that small schools are more effective at promoting higher quality education. We can gain insight into this debate by examining Chile's national voucher program. This paper uses 4th-grade data to compare achievement in private franchises, private independent, and public schools in Chile. Our findings suggest that franchises have a large advantage over independent schools, once student and peer attributes and selectivity are controlled for. We also find that further disaggregating school franchises widens the larger franchise advantage. We conclude that policies oriented to create incentives for private school owners to join or start up a franchise may have the potential for improving educational outcomes.;"[Elacqua, Gregory; Santos, Humberto] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Salazar, Felipe] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Elacqua, G (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.;gregory.elacqua@udp.cl;;Elacqua, Gregory/0000-0003-0066-3640;;;;64;9;9;0;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

Rural schools are more than half of the schools in Chile. This is a qualitative study involving six rural schools in the north, centre and south of the country, with a basis in action research and ethnography. The results show that inclusion has different meanings for different teachers, indicating that passage of the law has not been accompanied by a policy providing clear meanings to guide teaching practices. However, one meaning commonly shared is that inclusion, understood as the acceptance of everyone, is a duty of rural schools, a cultural feature that apparently distinguishes them from their urban counterparts.;"[Gloria Nunez, Carmen; Gonzalez, Bryan; Ascorra, Paula] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Pena, Monica] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Hain, Andrea] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile";;Nunez, CG (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.nunez@pucv.cl;;"Nunez, Carmen Gloria/0000-0001-7252-5031; Gonzalez Niculcar, Bryan/0000-0003-0644-0245";"PIA-ANID [CIE 160009]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico, Tecnologico y de Innovacion Tecnologica [1211163]";"This work was supported by PIA-ANID: [Grant Number CIE 160009]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico, Tecnologico y de Innovacion Tecnologica: [Grant Number 1211163].";;35;1;1;3;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

The research design was pre-experimental with a pre- and post-test which evaluated improvements in the participants' ability to recognize, analyse and design classroom verbal interaction strategies. The sample was comprised of 124 students at two Chilean universities: one public and one private. After five weeks of implementation, the students' ability to recognize, analyse and design classroom verbal interactions increased significantly, with statistically significant differences by university and specialization but not by sex or socioeconomic level. Noteworthy is a positive relationship between the use of the game outside class and the ability to analyse and design classroom interactions.

Main findings show an overall favorable context for the pedagogical use of ICT in such institutions, in terms of ICT infrastructure, support, policies and teachers' self-reported ICT related skills. In addition, teachers report a quite frequent use of some ICT resources, giving a high importance to students' learning of ICT. However, ICT integration is limited to a few specific resources (mainly computers and projectors), mostly applied to perform traditional pedagogical activities. Therefore, the expectations about the improvement of teaching and learning in Teacher Education in Chile through the integration of ICT, are not been fulfilled yet.

Design/methodology/approach Competing versions of Chilean educators' professionalism during the pandemic were analyzed based on government guidelines, national teachers' association statements, news reports and testimonies from teachers and principals collected from webinars. Findings The guidelines that the ministry issued after school building were required to close motivated educators to challenge a version of professionalism founded on new public management (NPM) policies, which mandated external control and emphasized students' academic outcomes. By challenging the dominant NPM perspective of professionalism, educators advocated for professional autonomy as well as students' and communities' well-being. Originality/value This essay offers insights into how the Chilean school system's response to the crisis evidenced competing notions of educators' professionalism. As the pandemic continues to be an ongoing phenomenon, four implications for reconceptualizing educators' professionalism are drawn, which could inform and offer guidance to practitioners and policymakers in the post-pandemic era.;"[Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Madrid, Romina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Gonzalez, A (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile.;agonzalezt@ncsh.cl;González, Álvaro/ABA-3272-2021;"González, Álvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409; FERNANDEZ COFRE, MARIA BEATRIZ/0000-0001-7639-2811";ANID/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003];The authors wish to acknowledge the insightful comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewer(s) that helped strengthen this manuscript.

An analysis of 1370 papers130 indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection indexes and 1240 indexed in the Scientific Electronic Library Online index (SciELO)indicates that Latin American academics are engaged in lively practices of publication. However, a dual pattern of publication is identified, characterised by researchers extensively publishing in non-mainstream journals and also maintaining a presence in mainstream journals. Issues related to language, rankings and prestige, the North/South divide, the distinction between hard/basic and soft/applied sciences and the nature of higher education studies are used to explain such a pattern. Although there is a tense process of securing a dual epistemic recognition, there is also a positive tension that involves collaboration across a plurality of knowledges. Finally, this paper offers the concept of zones of epistemic influence, which opens spaces for an ecology of knowledges in which knowledges from both the North and the South constitute a new assemblage that accords due weight to a plurality of epistemic interests.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Gomez, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl; carolina.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Gómez-González, Carolina/AAT-1020-2020; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Gomez-Gonzalez, Carolina/0000-0003-0202-085X";"Conicyt-Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170374]; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]";This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1170374 and PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003.

Although the problem of underrepresentation of female physicists has several causes, one likely reason is the lower interest that female school students have in physics activities. Several instructional solutions have been proposed to spark girls' interest in physics, including recent ones with mobile devices. However, mobile devices could be problematic technologies for school students and teachers, particularly if guidance in their use is not provided. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of a novel mobile application guided with laboratory reports to increase high school students' interest in physics. We also investigated whether the intervention with mobile laboratory activities facilitated learning about an important physics topic, namely, understanding graphs. The study was conducted in eight eligible schools, totaling data from 268 high school students (57% females). Results showed that all seven measures of self-rated interest in physics received higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. One of the items, which assessed changes in understanding physics, showed greater effects on females than on males. Hence, the instructional mobile application under consideration helped to spark students' interest in physics, and the effect was somewhat greater in schoolgirls, but the intervention did not change the test scores about understanding graphs, failing to demonstrate an association between increased interest in physics and changes in physics educational outcomes. The instructional implications for these findings, as well as limitations and future research directions, are discussed.;"[Carreno, Maria Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gallardo, Maria Jose] Univ Atacama, Sch Med, Copiapo, Chile";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"maria.carreno.m01@mail.pucv.cl; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; mariajose.gallardo@uda.cl";Gallardo, María José/ABH-2726-2021;Gallardo-Nelson, Maria Jose/0000-0003-2963-8692;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]; CORFO [16PES-66152]";This study is funded by the ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003, ANID Fondecyt 11180255, and CORFO 16PES-66152.;;53;0;0;9;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

The present study is aimed at analyzing the types of obstacles identified by science teachers who participated in a Teacher Reflection Workshop (TRW) on the formulation and use of questions in their lessons. The workshop consisted of stage 1 (7 sessions), stage 2 (video recordings in school classrooms), and stage 3 (3 sessions). The discourses of 8 participating teachers in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and natural science at different educational institutions in the city of Santiago, Chile, were analyzed in this case study. The analysis was carried out by the professors participating in the workshop, based on the participants' identification, initial attempts to address, and proposals to overcome, their obstacles. In the earlier stages of the process, the identified obstacles had procedural characteristics, but as the process advanced, they took on a more epistemological nature. One of the main differences between the initial and final identification of obstacles by the participating teachers is that the latter were more precise and critical, and the teachers increasingly demonstrated the ability to propose specific solutions to teaching problems. Engagement with the obstacles does not take place uniformly but depends on the types of obstacles that the teachers identify in their practice. Proposals for overcoming the obstacles require the teachers to have time for reflecting and validating their ideas in their practice.;"[Joglar, C.; Rojas, S.

It highlights the need to uncover assumptions and value orientations that are at the basis of these definitions and that tend to guide both conceptualizations and practices about the public role of the universities. It is argued that under neoliberal regimes, the public university takes on private aspects and the private university may even take on public aspects: Universities are here characteristically becoming hybrids. Despite these overlapping patterns, absences are discerned both in the idea and in the practices of public universities. The idea of the transformative university is proposed to help to remedy these deficiencies.;[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile;;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT; Fondecyt RegularComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]; Proyecto Redes [140084]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]";I want to thank the two anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

To address the potential bias due to the endogeneity of the competition among schools, an instrumental variable approach is implemented, using instruments associated with the size of each educational market. The results show that an increase of one standard deviation in competition among schools generates a moderate increase in standardized test results (0.06 standard deviations) and a more significant decrease in the other indicators of quality (between 0.02 and 0.16 standard deviations). Therefore, the results suggest a tension in the school between various objectives of educational policy, in which pressure to improve standardized test scores resulting from competition among schools could produce an undesired effect of deterioration in other dimensions of quality.;"[Gajardo, Felipe] Univ Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile";;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.;"fgajardo@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl";;;Center for Conflict and Social Cohesion [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009];The authors would like to thank Alejandra Falabella, Daniel Hojman and Juan Pablo Valenzuela for their comments and suggestions.

We found that mathematics anxiety can negatively influence pre-service teachers' expectations about students, and that future mathematics teachers' expectations of mathematics achievement are lower for girls than for boys. These effects are independent, as we did not find significant interaction effects between pre-service teacher's mathematics anxiety and student gender. Our results also suggest that mathematics anxiety could affect the capacity of pre-service teachers to develop inclusive learning environments in their classrooms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J;Richards, H;;;;Richards, Howard;;;Unbounded organisation and the future of socialism;EDUCATION AS CHANGE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"accumulation; Alexander; central planning; Marxism; social democracy; socialism";;This article starts with the question whether the socialism Neville Alexander advocated is a thing of the past or a prospect for the future. It considers two forms of 20(th)-century socialism, the centrally planned economy and social democracy, in the light of Marx's concept of accumulation. Accumulation' names both the logic of capitalism and the dynamic that drives it. A focus on the need to deal with the probability that the accumulation dynamic will falter in the process of moving from capitalism to socialism helps to explain socialism's decline. Unbounded organisation' is introduced as a broader concept that includes the bounded' social organisation that frames capitalism and its accumulation dynamic as a special case. It helps to both explain the decline of socialism and to suggest how to reverse that decline. It is suggested that the socialism of the future can best be defined not as a certain form of social organisation, but rather as the power of the people to choose the set of economic and other institutions that works best for them. Three of Alexander's contributions to building an unbounded socialism are found in his proposals for grass-roots organising at the neighbourhood level, in his promotion of multilingualism, and in his advocacy of alternative education.;Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile;;Richards, H (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile.;howardri00@yahoo.com;;;;;;61;2;2;0;58;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1682-3206;;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

J;Bernasconi, A;;;;Bernasconi, A;;;University entrepreneurship in a developing country: The case of the P. Universidad Catolica de Chile, 1985-2000;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Entrepreneurial University; higher education Chile; higher education Latin America; mode 2 knowledge production; organizational change; private higher education; privatization of higher education; second academic revolution; Triple Helix";"INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS; PRIVATE HIGHER-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; TRIPLE-HELIX; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS";Privatization in higher education is usually understood either as the surge of private institutions or as universities' growing reliance on private sources of funding or otherwise operating more like firms. Joining the growing literature on university entrepreneurship, this is a case study on the less examined problem of entrepreneurial universities in developing countries. In a period of roughly 15 years, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Chile, founded in 1888, turned itself from a mostly teaching institution to a research-oriented university, responsible for one-fourth of the Chile's mainstream scientific output and 40% of all Ph.D.s awarded nationally. Yet, public funding represents today only 17% of its revenues, down from almost 90% in 1972. How such academic development could have occurred as the State withdrew and the market took hold of Chilean higher education after the reforms introduced by the military rule of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) is the theme of this work. Universidad Catolica's policies and strategies are described, and the factors contributing to its success, together with their limitations, identified. The case suggests that orientation to the market can be more a means for survival and growth under the pressure of privatization, than a result of a 'Triple Helix' strategy of universities, government and industry to generate innovation out of academic knowledge. Secondly, while in the industrialized world, higher education entrepreneurship is associated with knowledge production for economic development ('Mode 2'), entrepreneurial universities in the context of developing countries may just be finding their way to the academic, disciplinary mode of research.;Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.;abernasconi@utalca.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;47;36;39;0;64;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;;;HIGH EDUC;High.

The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers' self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers' self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers' report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher's professional development.;"[Saadati, Farzaneh] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio; Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Santiago, Chile";;Saadati, F (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"farzaneh.saadati@gmail.com; chandiaeugenio7@gmail.com; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl";;Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075;"CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673, PAI AFB-170001]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral Project 3170673, Grant PAI AFB-170001, PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.;;60;0;0;7;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1386-4416;1573-1820;;J MATH TEACH EDUC;J.

That is, we compare the performance of girls versus boys within schools with single-sex classrooms compared to the performance of girls versus boys within schools with coeducational classrooms, using a difference-in-difference approach with school fixed effects. In line with the results of the previous literature that has found positive effects for female students, we find that coeducational schools with single-sex classrooms reduce the math gender gap by more than half. The effect is consistent with an increase in the math achievement of female students with no decrease in the achievement of male students. Finally, this effect is not driven by teacher characteristics or student-teacher gender matching, but it seems to be driven by how female students respond to the gender composition of the classroom.;"[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile";;"Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile.";vparedes@fen.uchile.cl;;;"Fondecyt InicioComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170968]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009]; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [NCS17_015]";This work was supported by Fondecyt Inicio [Project 11170968], the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009], and ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Code: NCS17_015.;;49;0;0;7;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1934-5747;1934-5739;;J RES EDUC EFF;J.

A particular issue is that of the presence of peripheral regions such as Latin America. The focus here is research into higher education reforms and, by using bibliometrics, a word frequency analysis and a thematic analysis, patterns of publication and themes in two different academic datasets - the global Web of Science and the more regional SciELO - are examined. Although the configuration of knowledge production on higher education reforms is seen as relatively homogeneous in certain respects, separate circuits of knowledge production are also revealed and even within a region (here, Latin America). Higher education reform is posed differently according to the publication circuits of journals and their position in global knowledge markets. A geopolitical imbalance in knowledge production is revealed and it is suggested that different regions of the world possess distinctive epistemic identities.

The intervention was based on a workshop in which students learned IPS-I strategies and solved information problems using a customized Internet search software package. Results showed that members of the experimental group changed their search behavior and improved the quality of their products. However, no correlation between the number of search actions and product quality was found.

To do so, the article begins by arguing that the university becomes part of the Enlightenment and accesses to modernity when the Faculty of Philosophy ceases to be conceptualized as the handmaiden of the Faculty of Theology (philosophia theologiae ancilla) and grows to be understood as the mistress' torchbearer, as ironically remarked by Kant. In the following decades, the new role that philosophy adopts in the division of academic labor changes the relationship of the institution with both the political and religious powers, opening the door on the road to the nation state and, further down, to the subordination of its activities to global academic capitalism. Consequently, traditional normative referents, as those proclaimed by Kant and Humboldt where universities were conceived as responsible for the evolution of modern society, lose plausibility and are subjected to the criticism of ideologies. The article concludes by examining future trends in education and research conducted in contemporary universities and by arguing that the crisis of the modern idea of the university is, in fact, an expression of its modern character that now turns against this very institution.;"[Joaquin Brunner, Jose; Labrana Vargas, Julio Roberto] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Ciencias Desarrollo, Osorno, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Programa Invest Gobernanza & Inclus Org, Osorno, Chile; [Rodriguez-Ponce, Emilio] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile";;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile.;"josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com; Julio.LabranaVargas@uni-wh.de; fganga@ulagos.cl; erodriguez@uta.cl";"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021; Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/AAV-2527-2021";Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/0000-0001-9325-6459;;;;67;10;13;4;12;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

It critically analyzes the university reform in Latin America dominated by the thought and practice promoted by various international financial institutions (such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB]) beginning in the 1980s and then looks at the feasibility of an alternative Freirian view. The work of Paulo Freire celebrated the liberating role that public university education should play in the training of citizens and professionals, that is with a critical and ethical conscience, committed to the needs of the locality, region and the world. All this is in clear opposition to what has happened to Latin American universities, influenced by neo-liberal reforms over the last decades.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Santiago, Chile";;"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Santiago, Chile.";oespinoza@academia.cl;;;;;;52;7;7;1;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7240;1465-3877;;J MORAL EDUC;J.

This paper draws on the experiences of 16 5-to 7-year-old children, transitioning from kindergarten to first grade in Chile as reported by them through visual participatory research. Integral to the ethical principles were the use of a visual participatory design, a listening framework and the child's rights perspective. In order to be faithful to the research design proposed, different ethical guidelines were revised and followed to ensure protection, anonymity, the right to withdraw and privacy to the children deciding to get involved in the research process. Essential to this work was recognising the child as the most knowledgeable agent in her/his own experiences in order to minimise issues of power and increase children's awareness during the data collection process. Findings from the study demonstrate different situations in which the researcher's selfreflexivity can enhance positive outcomes related to ethical issues and young children's ability to understand the research process, communicate meanings and jointly create new meanings through the tools provided and activities proposed.

Students criticized the privatization of higher education and the multiple flaws of this sector, which included corruption scandals during the process of quality assurance certification. After the end of the movement, the government announced a new quality assurance system, triggering public discussion over this issue in the media. The most influential newspapers and educational authorities participated actively in this debate. Through editorials and columns, these education agents constructed quality assurance discursively as a domain for experts, who have to design and administer quality standards for all educational institutions and actions. These procedures regulate and discipline educational practices, but professors and students are excluded from this debate. Thus, this quality assurance discussion reproduces the traditional neoliberal power relations in education and does not problematize the role of education in society.;Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile;;Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile.;ccabalin@uchile.cl;Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014;Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478;;;;45;7;8;2;33;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-8487;1750-8495;;CRIT STUD EDUC;Crit.

Using framing theory, this article presents a critical discourse analysis on the editorials published about the 2011 student movement by El Mercurio, the most influential newspaper in Chile. El Mercurio is more than a newspaper. It is an institution; an institution that supports conservative ideas. El Mercurio framed the public discussion about educational policies and defended neoliberal education based on three discourses: the neoliberal system is absolute, public education is valued less than private and education is a technical issue, not political. By invoking this rhetoric strategy, these discourses attempted to maintain the neoliberal education system in Chile, which in turn rejected the social struggles of the student movement.";Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile;;Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile.;ccabalin@uchile.cl;Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014;Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478;;;;44;17;21;0;25;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0159-6306;1469-3739;;DISCOURSE-ABINGDON;Discourse;OCT;2014;35;4;;;;;485;498;;10.1080/01596306.2013.871233;;;14;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;AM8MW;WOS:000340130900002;;;;;2022-04-06;

The main findings were: first, the magnitude of the SES segregation of both low-SES and high-SES students in Chile was very high (Duncan Index ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 in 2008); second, during the last decade, SES school segregation tended to slightly increase in Chile, especially in high schools (both public and private schools); third, private schools - including voucher schools - were more segregated than public schools for both low-SES and high-SES students; and finally, some market dynamics operating in the Chilean education (like privatization, school choice, and fee-paying) accounted for a relevant proportion of the observed variation in SES school segregation at municipal level. These findings are analyzed from an educational policy perspective in which the link between SES school segregation and market-oriented mechanisms in education plays a fundamental role.";"[Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [de los Rios, Danae] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile.;cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Bellei, Cristián/D-9921-2015";Bellei, Cristián/0000-0001-6963-7809;;;;96;179;210;4;75;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

A Qualitative Study;BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;NATIVES;This paper seeks to contribute to the discussion on the current generation of students and their relationship to technology, providing qualitative, empirical information obtained in the Chilean context. The study analyses and discusses the ideas regarding the emergence of a new generation of learners, or digital natives, as characterised by wide-ranging access to digital media and by having new skills and abilities. In-depth interviews held with students and teachers from four different cities in the country are analysed. The data shows evidence of a generation of learners without shared traits, with segments of learners presenting practices that do not characterise the entire generation. In addition, the data shows that the skills and abilities described in the literature do not represent a precise description of those that the students exploit when using technology. Beyond the ability to work simultaneously on several tasks, some learners have the ability to manage the attention that they pay to their work on the computer in sophisticated ways, and although some prefer images to words on paper, among others, there is still a taste for reading actual printed books. All in all, students and teachers describe a certain distance and conflict between the practices with the use of ICTs and their everyday school experiences.;"[Sanchez, Jaime] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 2777, Chile; [Contreras, David; Meyer, Eduardo] Pontificial Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Sanchez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago 2777, Chile.;jsanchez@dcc.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Salinas, Alvaro/F-9959-2012";Salinas, Alvaro/0000-0001-9655-761X;;;;19;26;30;0;21;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

To address this issue, we use a measure of competition that captures three major characteristics of market competition in a spatial context: the number of competitors, based on distance buffers; the size of competitors, measured by the enrollment of voucher schools; and the geographical distance among public schools and their competitors. To control for the potential endogeneity of our measure of spatial competition on public schools' efficiency, we use an instrumental variable based on the discontinuites generated by admissions municipality boundaries . We do not find evidence that public schools' efficiency increases or decreases as the result of the increment of voucher schools located near to public schools, an increase in the enrollment of existing voucher schools, or both factors simultaneously. This result is robust to: (1) the limit of education market or other measures of spatial competition; (2) the methodology used to compute the efficiency measures; and (3) whether we explain efficiency or educational performance.";"[Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo; Cortes, Yasna] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile; [Sarrias, Mauricio] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile";;Quintero-Fragozo, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile.;camilo.quintero@alumnos.ucn.cl;Sarrias, Mauricio/L-7627-2018;Sarrias, Mauricio/0000-0001-5932-4817;;;;91;0;0;3;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

However, not all ICT usage models are designed to affect student outcomes. Therefore, to accurately study the impact of ICT, the concept of an educational programme supported by ICT must first be defined. The authors propose the ICT for Education (ICT4E) programme, an evidence-based framework to determine a model's ability to produce improvements before having to evaluate its results. The framework has four components: implementation, intervention, transference and total cost. Based on an explicit definition of the outcomes pursued by a given programme, this framework supports the design of its activities to promote sustainable changes in pedagogical practices in schools and calculate the programme's total cost. The authors illustrate this with a programme implemented in six countries. In Chile, the ICT4E programme forms part of the policy for educational technology, evaluating the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives.;"[Rodriguez, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Dombrovskaia, Lioubov] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Informat, Santiago, Chile";;Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;prodriguez@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Rodríguez, Patricio/F-8606-2015";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Rodríguez, Patricio/0000-0002-7361-5132";;;;113;15;16;1;55;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1475-939X;1747-5139;;TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC;Technol.

Using the Anthropological Theory of Didactics (Chevallard, 1999) and the Theory of Didactic Situations (Brousseau, 1990). the investigation began with the nuclear mathematical learning and contents of the current official elementary school programs in mathematics. Then, it continued with the observation and analysis of teaching-learning processes developed for arithmetics in elementary schools in the Metropolitan Region and ended with the analysis of the institutional restrictions imposed by schools for the development of those processes. We identified the phenomenon of the progressive inhibition of some mathematical abilities of students through elementary school.

Following up a qualitative tradition, a purposive sample was used which considered 13 ECEC settings, from the 2 leading providers of public ECEC in Chile: JUNJI (the National Board of Nurseries for its acronym in Spanish) and Integra Foundation. Different techniques were used for data collection: semi-structured interviews with principals, ECEC teachers, teaching assistants, and parents. In addition, a shadowing technique was used to observe principals. Findings show that ECEC principals' leadership is based on limited space to develop a pedagogical leadership due to a high administrative workload, alongside strong ethics of care fostered by principals, which are shared by the educational community - ECEC teachers, teaching assistants and families. We aim to generate knowledge about ECEC leadership for the Latin American context, particularly for the Chilean case, where we do not have any evidence about this topic.;"[Opazo, Maria-Jose] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Opazo, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;mariajose.opazo@ciae.uchile.cl;;;ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003];Support from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.;;44;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-293X;1752-1807;;EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC;Eur.

To achieve this, the discussion that has taken place in these countries about the importance of sentence grammar in the teaching of writing is analysed. Three proposals for the contextualised teaching of grammar are systematised from the literature review: those that are focused in the writing process, those focused on metalinguistic reflection and those with a greater emphasis in the grammar of text. Besides, the school curricula of 14 Spanish-speaking countries that were involved in the international assessment of TERCE are examined. This analysis shows an evident attachment to the communicative approach of grammar. This means that in almost all countries grammar is taught linked to the linguistic skills of reading, writing or orality, with an especial emphasis in writing. Also, two tendencies can be observed in the curricula of this countries, that guide the way in which curricula use sentence grammar to have an impact on written communication: (i) from sentence grammar to text grammar and (ii) from text grammar to sentence grammar.;"[Sotomayor, Carmen; Chaf, Gabriela; Osorio, Gabriela; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Julia Coloma, Carmen] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Dept Fonoaudiol, Santiago, Chile";;Sotomayor, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;csotomayor@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT]Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160471]";"This work was supported by PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [Project FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT No1160471].";;61;1;2;1;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0267-1522;1470-1146;;RES PAP EDUC;Res.

DUAL PROCESS THEORY OF REASONING AND WASON SELECTION TASK;EDUCACION XX1;;;Spanish;Article;;;;;;"Chile; cognition; mathematical logic; logical thinking; reasoning";;Inglis and Simpson hold that there are significat differences between Mathematics university students reasoning and general population reasoning, since, in an experiment based on selection task presented by them in 2006, Mathematics students obtained better outcomes that other students. They tried to explain this fact by means of dual process theory of reasoning. We present in this paper a similar experiment. Our experiment does not show significantly different executions between Mathematics students and other students. For this reason, we conclude that it is possible that selection task is not an appropriate task for describing the different students reasoning and we need more evidences for confirming that Mathematics students reason in a different way.;[Lopez Astorga, Miguel] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile;;Astorga, ML (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Talca, Chile.;"milopez@ultalca.cl; rodlagos@ulagos.cl";;"Lopez Astorga, Miguel/0000-0002-6004-0587; Lagos, Rodrigo Antonio/0000-0002-2254-7774";;;;17;2;2;0;24;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

SNA enables a deep exploration of learning and development as a by-product of social interactions. Research findings from social networks for creativity has found specific social structures that ease knowledge transfer and the emergence of creative ideas in a variety of contexts. This work links the research findings in social networks and creativity with education and classroom activities, to provide a framework from which to understand social interactions in the classroom and to inform educational improvement. By conceptualizing learning and problem solving as the creative outcome of both cognitive and social processes, this paper describes how different forms of collaboration and social structures might emerge based on teaching and learning practices enacted in the classroom through the lens of social network analysis. In addition, attention to the classroom network should inform teachers on areas for pedagogical innovation. Subsequently, I propose guidelines on how to advance pedagogical decision-making for learning and creativity based upon students' social networks.

This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades.

Professional development programs are proposed as effective mechanisms to fabricate the new teacher. However, this teacher has proved hard to produce. Thus, the resistor teacher has emerged into the field as a way to explain failure within school mathematics reform. In this article, I assume that resistance is a consequential response against particular forms of subjectivation imposed on mathematics teachers. Using conceptual tools from Hall and Foucault, I explore the ways wherein a high school mathematics teacher reinvents meanings of being a mathematics teacher in the context of a professional development program aimed to implement problem-solving instruction. Against the myth of the resistor teacher unwilling to change, what emerges is a process of struggle over meaning. School mathematics reform, considered as an ideological event, becomes a site in which competing meanings about being a mathematics teacher are negotiated, contested, and resisted.;[Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile;;Valoyes-Chavez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;luz.valoyes@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3180238]";Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and CONICYT/FONDECYT #3180238 is gratefully recognized.;;47;4;5;1;15;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

Significant differences between urban and rural schools were found in terms of accessibility issues. Moreover, rural school integration programs have a lower probability of providing adapted resources or sign language interpreters.

Based on available material and secondary sources, it describes the main features of this student movement, analyses the key components of the students' discourse and its relationship with the Chilean market-oriented educational system, and identifies its impact on the field of higher education. The paper argues that this student movement was a process of expressing accumulated grievances against some neoliberal features of Chilean education. Since this movement is also linked to the emergence of a new generation of higher education students, it identifies relevant characteristics of current students' organisations and protests. Finally, the paper discusses hypotheses for interpreting the recent student movements. This case is informative not only for those concerned with student participation, but also with the potential downsides of market-oriented educational policies.;"[Bellei, Cristian; Orellana, Victor] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Cabalin, Cristian] Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl;"Bellei, Cristián/D-9921-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014";"Bellei, Cristián/0000-0001-6963-7809; Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478; Orellana, Victor/0000-0001-9599-966X";;;;46;63;77;1;47;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

Given their consequences, and the high stakes derived from them, assessment systems put pressure on schools to an extent where their practices and internal policies adapt to the logic of these mechanisms. The behaviours that emerge from this adaptation are seen as gaming the system' and are often portrayed as the responsibility of test users. However, the article aims at pushing the question around the consequences of metrics further, in terms of what these strategic gaming behaviours are adapting to and to what extent predominant metrics are accomplishing their assumptions of social justice. Through theoretically discussing the concept of social justice in connection with educational assessment, the paper problematises whether current metrics and their consequences, on the one hand, are able to respond to their underlying principles of equality of opportunity, which are characteristic of justice as distribution, and, on the other hand, highlights the insufficiency of these principles to respond to current developments of the concept of social justice with regard to the dimensions of recognition and participation, with considerations for their potential inclusion in future assessment systems.;"[Florez Petour, Maria Teresa; Rozas Assael, Tamara; Gysling, Jacqueline; Olave Astorga, Jose Miguel] Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile";;Petour, MTF (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile.;mtflorez@u.uchile.cl;;;;;;60;2;2;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-4985;1465-3915;;OXFORD REV EDUC;Oxf.

Data from a questionnaire administered to a nationwide sample of 6932 teachers in Chile was used to characterise their activities and perceptions associated with ICT. Multiple regression analyses were applied to determine relationships between them. The findings show first, that teachers use ICT more frequently outside the classroom for class preparation; second, that their perceptions of ICT impact on professional practice is the main factor associated with their use of ICT inside and outside the classroom; third, that less experienced teachers use communication tools with colleagues and students more often; and finally, that there is a need to examine teachers' use of (ready-made) Internet resources.";"[Ibieta, Andrea; Hinostroza, Enrique; Labbe, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Study Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Santiago, Chile; [Ibieta, Andrea] Univ La Frontera, Dept Psychol, Temuco, Chile";;"Ibieta, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco, Chile.; Ibieta, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Dept Psychol, Temuco, Chile.";enrique.hinostroza@iie.cl;Hinostroza, J.

The objective of this study was to measure and assess 5th grade student creativity, from 24 educational institutions, and compare whether results show significant differences in certain variables. It was concluded that there were significant differences for certain variables such as type of school, gender, socioeconomic status and participation in extracurricular activities. It was also found that as socioeconomic level increased, so did creative ability, with standardized test results following similar trends as applied creativity tests.;"[Castillo-Vergara, Mauricio; Barrios Galleguillos, Nicole; Jofre Cuello, Laura; Alvarez-Marin, Alejandro; Acuna-Opazo, Christian] Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Ind, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile";;Castillo-Vergara, M (corresponding author), Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Ind, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile.;mhcastillo@userena.cl;Castillo, Mauricio/AAB-5606-2019;"Castillo, Mauricio/0000-0002-3368-6497; Alvarez-Marin, Alejandro/0000-0001-7151-3717; Acuna-Opazo, Christian/0000-0003-1737-6111";;;;78;16;18;10;53;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

An Exploratory Study of the Chilean Higher Education Quality Assurance System;HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"accreditation; Chile; quality assurance; quality enhancement; higher education policy";"GRADUATE EMPLOYABILITY; DROPOUT; SUCCESS; MASSIFICATION; UNIVERSITIES; INSTITUTIONS; EMPLOYMENT; RATES; MODEL";In Chile, as well as in most of Latin America, public policies for higher education have recently adopted a focus on quality assurance and accreditation systems. Uncertainty, however, still exists in terms of the quality assurance consistency in the current Chilean accreditation system, especially in terms of the relation between public policy quality indicators for higher education and their relation to accreditation outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to make a first explorative attempt to investigate the relationships between these indicators and the results of undergraduate programme accreditation. We hypothesised that the public policy quality indicators of first-year drop-out rate, employment at graduation and ratio of actual to expected time to graduation would be strongly correlated to undergraduate programme accreditation as well as largely explaining its accreditation-year variance. By means of correlation and multiple regression analyses, we found small-sized associations, being first-year drop-out the only significant predictor of programme accreditation, explaining a 9.4% of its variance. These results raise questions regarding the consistency between the aims of public policy for higher education and the current accreditation system. This study should be of value to policy makers, managers and curriculum developers in terms of this initial analysis of the consistency between quality indicators and the accreditation system. Further research is necessary to make a systematic and in-depth assessment of the impact of quality assurance mechanisms to provide better rationale for making important decisions such as when defining the characteristics of the accrediting institutions as well as for establishing effective ways to achieve the proposed public policy objectives.;"[Jerez, Oscar; Orsini, Cesar; Hasbun, Beatriz; Lobos, Eduardo; Munoz, Marcos] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, Cesar] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile";;Jerez, O (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile.;ojerez@fen.uchile.cl;"Lobos, Eduardo/AAI-8022-2020; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Jerez, Oscar/J-2947-2016";"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Jerez, Oscar/0000-0003-0869-5938";;;;52;6;6;4;60;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

An activity in this context is defined as a sequence of actions that an actor may perform to accomplish a task objective. The proposed methodology validates a design experimentally by comparing the actions it specifies with those that are observed in an actual activity. Analyzing the data collected through such observation is central to determining which actions would improve the social dynamics of the original design. The criteria for adopting a discovered pattern will depend on the activity's aims and the kind of actions observed. The proposed methodology is illustrated using data gathered during physics classes in two schools. The findings suggest that when formulating technologically mediated activities inside a classroom, designers should seek to incorporate face-to-face actions that support the dynamics of the activity and assist in achieving the social objectives of the tasks performed. The inclusion of such actions in design upgrades can also help prevent the occurrence of actions that interfere with the activity.;"[Francisca Capponi, Maria] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Marshall, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Math, Santiago, Chile; [Ester Lagos, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Comenius, Santiago, Chile";;Capponi, MF (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"mcapponi@inacap.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; gm@mat.puc.cl; maria.lagos@centrocomenius.org";Marshall, Guillermo/F-2302-2011;;;;;40;6;8;0;13;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

J;Bernasconi, A;;;;Bernasconi, Andres;;;Does the affiliation of universities to external organizations foster diversity in private higher education? Chile in comparative perspective;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"affiliation; Chile; differentiation; diversification; interorganizational relationships; isomorphism; new institutionalism; organizational linkages; private higher education; proprietary higher education; relationship magnitude";"INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; PATTERNS";The expansion of private sectors of higher education has usually been regarded as a factor of diversification in higher education systems. Some of this differentiation has been found to arise from the affiliation of private institutions with organizations outside the field of higher education. This article reports the results of a study of this form of interorganizational relationship in private universities in Chile. Cases include universities founded or sponsored by religious, business and military organizations. A typology of private universities is proposed, on the basis of the forms affiliation (or its absence), was observed to take in the cases examined. Weak and strong forms of affiliation are described, and affiliated universities are compared to proprietary universities, i.e., those owned by individuals who govern them from their positions in the board of directors, and independent universities, in which governance lies with internal-academic or administrative-constituents. Albeit derived from the case of Chile, the typology could be applied to the analysis of private higher education in other national systems. The second part of the article seeks to ascertain whether affiliation operates as a source of differentiation in Chilean private higher education. Results show that, compared to the other types of private universities, the affiliated ones possess distinctive mission statements and declarations of principles, consistent with the orientations of their sponsor institutions, they tend to be smaller, and to have more full-time and better qualified faculty. Some receive financial support from their sponsor organization or its members. Distinctiveness was not found in indicators of prestige and student selectivity, nor in tuition levels, program offerings, curriculum design, the weight of research and graduate programs in their functions, student socioeconomic profile, and faculty involvement in governance. This is not to say that there are no differences in these dimensions among private universities: much diversity exists, but most of it cuts across all categories of interest for our study. Overall, affiliation does not appear to be a strong factor behind the diversification that exists in the Chilean private university sector.;Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.;abernasconi@utalca.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;56;18;23;0;31;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Two segregation indices, the dissimilarity index and the square root index, are used to meet these objectives. The results show high and persistent segregation for high socioeconomic status students, in contrast to the moderate and decreasing segregation levels seen in the low and middle socioeconomic groups. Besides, the decomposition exercise posits the universities as the focus of segregation in this system, where both the institution and the degree program constitute relevant factors in understanding the unequal distribution of high socioeconomic status students. These results invite an in-depth look at the mechanisms that hinder social integration in this area, with a particular emphasis on the segregation of the highest socioeconomic status students, whose place in this system promotes their academic and social differentiation.;"[Kuzmanic, Danilo; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Luisa Quaresma, Maria] Univ Autonoma Chile, Inst Iberoamericano Desarrollo Sostenible, Santiago, Chile";;Kuzmanic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;danilo.kuzmanic@ciae.uchile.cl;;"Quaresma, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-5292-2603; Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213";"ANID, FONDECYT [1170371]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]";This work was supported by ANID, FONDECYT under Grant Regular Project #1170371.

The majority of paper-based options can be classified as being either multiple-choice or constructed-response. Therefore, in the process of creating an educational drill-and-practice video game, one fundamental question to be answered is which is the most appropriate response format? This paper answers this question, proposing a hybrid format that we call fine-grained multiple-choice, where the player constructs their response one element at a time, with each element chosen from a pre-defined set. A comparative study was conducted with second grade students. When comparing the impact of an educational drill-and-practice video game that uses multiple-choice with one that uses fine-grained multiple-choice, we observe that the fine-grained multiple-choice game achieved better results. However, the multiple-choice game was substantially more successful at capturing the students' interest and motivation. Considering the widespread use of the multiple-choice format in game-based learning activities, as well as in interactive activities, this research suggests rethinking what the most suitable answer format might be for each area of the curriculum and for the different types of games.;"[Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile; [Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Grass, Antonio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";;"Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile.; Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile.";vagner.beserra@gmail.com;"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748";"CONICYT - FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca";"This work was supported by CONICYT - FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca.";;88;3;3;1;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

The proposed model, called ICTE-MM (ICT in School Education Maturity Model), has three elements supporting educational processes: information criteria, ICT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on ICT, five Leverage Domains are defined: Educational Management, Infrastructure, Administrators, Teachers and Students. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model's elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two elements establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international standards and best practices for ICT management. It has been validated through data collection instruments and its associated web-support tool was also refined with a small pilot study. In summary, the proposed ICTE-MM model provides a basis for self-assessment and improvement planning. It is not just a diagnostic tool but has also been found to be useful for guiding the principals in ICT investment.;"[Solar, Mauricio] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Sabattin, Jorge; Parada, Victor] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Solar, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.;"mauricio.solar@usm.cl; jorge.sabattin@usach.cl; victor.parada@usach.cl";"Solar, Mauricio G./A-1109-2008; Solar, Mauricio/AAE-9673-2020; Sabattin, Jorge/P-2589-2019";"Solar, Mauricio/0000-0002-4433-4622; Sabattin, Jorge/0000-0003-0270-6560";;;;32;36;37;4;40;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

The analysis is based on the data from a national study aimed at measuring students' Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills for learning. A factor analysis was carried out to categorize students' activities with computers and several indexes were constructed to define the comparison groups. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explain the frequency of the activities. Results show that students with access to computers at home mainly perform activities categorized as Socializing, Academic, Gaming and Production and that although the absolute frequency of these activities differs across groups, the profiles of computer use are surprisingly similar for groups based on students' socio-economic group, experience with ICT, and self-confidence in the use of ICT. The only variable that discriminates user profiles is gender. Based on these findings, it can be claimed that Chilean secondary students with access to computers at home tend to show a rather homogenous computer-use profile, once access is equated.;"[Enrique Hinostroza, J.; Matamala, Carolina; Labbe, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena; Cabello, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile";;Hinostroza, JE (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile.;enrique.hinostroza@iie.cl;"Hinostroza, J.

In the context of attempts to address criticism that the sector is not free, public or high-quality enough, this article examines the association between education and its moral and ethical dimensions, and their separate yet complementary consideration alongside economic development, through the two centuries of the Chilean state's existence. Since the beginning of the current decade, discontent with the framing and performance of higher education as a whole has grown. The overview traces this process not as fresh crisis, but part of a social question pondered repeatedly in the past and supported with varying success through educational and political initiatives. This historical (and historiographic) approach illuminates the limits of conceiving of higher education as either an economic good or as a human right, and an overlooked need to support its benefits through policy. Not simply an interpenetration with economic thinking, but also a lack of sufficient appreciation of Chile's fundamental and singular character, present as challenges in understanding expanded access's function and its prospective contribution to growing debates around ethics and inequality.;"[Leihy, Peodair; Salazar, Jose M.] Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile";;Leihy, P (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile.;pete.leihy@uv.cl;;"Salazar, Jose/0000-0003-4636-1779; Leihy, Peodair/0000-0002-5569-0905";;;;57;6;7;3;38;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Results, obtained through Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and multilevel models, were consistent with earlier literature. Furthermore, attitudes explain up to 25% of Chilean improvement and 8% of the variance within schools. In contrast, learning strategies are unrelated to achievement changes.

Through a comprehensive meta-data analysis and bibliographic review, we collected information on both educational systems and their ICT adoption policies. Key differences necessary to understand how both countries have developed their educational systems by integrating ICT were analyzed, including the educational system structure, the organization of state entities responsible for educational ICT, cultural characteristics, the creation of policies regarding ICT in education, and the effectiveness of such policies for the expansion of infrastructure and the ICT curriculum integration. We analyze these key differences in order to understand two cases of ICT integration initiatives on a national level, so that we might better understand the primary factors that influence successful ICT integration, as well as those that may hinder progress in this area.

Data was obtained from interviews and surveys applied to teachers and students from 145 rural schools. Results show that teachers function as gatekeepers. They do not teach students how to use ICT explicitly, but when teachers have high expectations, skills and technology access, this leads to conditions for students learning how to use ICT. Finally, the data contributes to a better understanding of the new role that teachers and schools play in rural areas in terms of social and symbolic integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The research hypothesis is that the university's management, as a dependent variable, is impacted by self-assessment. The data gathering process was structured in three methodological steps: Step 1 considered the consistency analysis to evaluate the use of managerial language and visualize any consequences of planning documents after self-assessment. Step 2 involved the elaboration of a semi-structured interview that was applied to a sample of 12 key informants with the objective of encouraging qualitative categorization regarding the self-evaluation process and its effects. Step 3 entailed the construction of a questionnaire that would allow for a quantitative description.

Most schools in Chile provide either primary or secondary education. The authors analyze the effect of private voucher education on students who are forced to enroll at a different school to attend secondary education once graduated from primary schooling-structural switches. Moreover, the data set the authors use in this article contains information on previous academic achievement and thus allows them to identify differences in students' unobservable characteristics. Using a number of propensity-score-based econometric techniques and the changes-in-changes estimation method, the authors find that private voucher education leads to small, sometimes not statistically significant differences in academic performance. The estimated effect of private voucher education amounts to about 4% to 6% of one standard deviation in test scores. In contrast, the literature on Chile based on cross-sectional data had previously found positive effects of about 15% to 20% of one standard deviation.;"[Lara, Bernardo; Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile.;"blara@ing.uchile.cl; amizala@dii.uchile.cl; andrea.repetto@uai.cl";"Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Repetto, Andrea/AAF-7404-2021";"Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741";;;;39;25;26;1;30;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0162-3737;1935-1062;;EDUC EVAL POLICY AN;Educ.

These compositions produce different learning and social interaction results. The ability to change the group member composition in real time and dynamically enables the leveling up of learning results and improvements in the participants' social relationships. Changes in composition also facilitate the analysis of the best criteria to be used in a determined activity. We propose a face-to-face collaborative environment supported by wireless handhelds that allows for dynamic changes in the composition of groups while an activity is underway.

The analysis is based on the discourse on the public/private divide in higher education scrutinising the opinion columns of El Mercurio, a major Chilean newspaper. The authors identify the discursive disappearance of the public university and the reappearance of the 'public' dimension connected to the private sector. The discourse of a 'diverse and mixed' system is accomplished by two discursive devices: (a) Reference to (selected) global trends and (b) Scientific expertise in higher education. The economic and discursive power of El Mercurio enhances the discourses of opinion columnists on the public/private divide. As a result, the concept of the public takes a hybrid turn, detaching itself from the State as its exclusive owner and connecting it to the market.;"[Simburger, Elisabeth] Univ Valparaiso, Dept Sociol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Simburger, E (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Dept Sociol, Valparaiso, Chile.;elisabeth.simbuerger@uv.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies about Political Culture, Memory and Human Rights at the Universidad de Valparaiso";Work on this article was supported by the Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT and the research grant Fondecyt Regular 1141271, by the PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003 and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies about Political Culture, Memory and Human Rights at the Universidad de Valparaiso.

To tap into their intuitions about fractions, students were presented with pairs of fractions on the screen for a limited time of 10s. Fraction pairs to be compared were controlled as to whether fractions shared or not a common component (numerator or denominator), as well as whether the greater fraction was the one with greater components or not. Data from about 500 students were processed with a clustering analysis based on these four item types, revealing distinct patterns of answers that we interpret in terms of strategies for answering the task. Half of the sample followed a simple larger-component-larger-fraction strategy as suggested by a congruency-based implementation of the natural number bias, although several clusters showed opposite patterns. These results show that a short, simple task can provide valuable information about students' individual differences in comparing fractions, useful for both research and practice in mathematics education. We discuss implications of these results for research and practice related to mathematics cognition and education.;"[Maximiliano Gomez, David] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile; [Maximiliano Gomez, David; Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, DIM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CMM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile";;"Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile.; Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile.";david.gomez@uoh.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436;"CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; CONICYT/PCI Redes [150009]";"The authors are grateful to the students, teachers, personnel, and authorities of the five schools and the central administration of the school network that made possible this research; to Benjamin Bossi and Sergio Orellana for their assistance in collecting the data; and to Cristian Reyes and Wim Van Dooren for valuable discussions that helped in shaping this work and manuscript.

These institutions depend to a certain extent on accreditation decisions to obtain indirect public funding. However, the system relies on faculty nominated by conglomerates formed by these same institutions to decide on accreditation. This arrangement creates a potential conflict of interest that can jeopardize the accreditation's legitimacy. We explore this potential bias through an empirical study examining voting behaviour by commissioners of the Chilean National Commission of Accreditation from March 2013 to October 2016. We assess whether commissioners appeared as favouring institutions within their appointing conglomerates. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the region designed to examine the presence of bias in higher education accreditation. Findings indicate commissioners, on average, tended to favour institutions in their appointing conglomerates. We discuss the findings in the broader context of a forthcoming reform of the accreditation system.;"[Barroilhet, Agustin] Univ Chile, Law Sch, Pio Nono 1, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Ortiz, Rocio; Quiroga, Bernardo F.; Silva, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile";;Quiroga, BF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile.;bfquirog@puc.cl;Quiroga, Bernardo F./W-2712-2018;Quiroga, Bernardo F./0000-0002-0465-0460;;;;37;2;2;3;5;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

In this paper, we report on the findings of a multiple case study that delved into the factors and processes explaining different levels of sustainability of educational effectiveness for schools previously identified and studied as highly effective and located in low-income areas. We show that effectiveness is a fragile attainment that is affected by a variety of external and internal processes. Transformations in the local context (demographic changes and the dynamics of the school market), and educational policies and programs are key external factors. In the internal realm, the role of school administrators, principals, and leadership teams, the organization of pedagogical work, and the school culture modulate the sustainability of educational effectiveness in the long term.;"[Bellei, Cristian; Morawietz, Liliana; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Vanni, Xavier] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Morawietz, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;lmorawietz@ciae.uchile.cl;"; Bellei, Cristian/D-9921-2015";"Valenzuela, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-0445-968X; Bellei, Cristian/0000-0001-6963-7809";"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; Anillo ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS [SOC 1104]";Support from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and Anillo Project SOC 1104 is gratefully acknowledged.;;60;5;5;11;25;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

From its origin, artistic movements, ideologies, culture, technology and market demands, among many others, have continually modeled its epistemology and phenomenology. The Bauhaus, established a conception of Design almost a century ago but that is still valid in Latin America, even though its extreme dogmatism was the cause of its decline. In this opportunity, we review the influence of the Gothic, the Montessori pedagogy, the ideologies of the late nineteenth century, intuition and modernism, as central aspects in the original didactic and with it we have developed a simple classroom exercise, where they apply to identify the original elements that still prevail in the teaching practice of Design. These influences tend to be forgotten, but they have evolved since 1919, until decanting in the Design Thinking method, which, with the filters of contemporaneity, has put the own way of thinking and doing of the design at the disposal of other disciplines.;"[Donoso, Sergio] Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Dept Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile; [Mirauda, Pedro; Jacob, Ruben] Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Escuela Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile";;"Donoso, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Dept Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile.; Donoso, S (corresponding author), Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago, Chile.";"sergiodonoso@uchilefau.cl; pmirauda@gmail.com; rubenhjd@uchilefau.cl";Jacob-Dazarola, Ruben/K-1613-2016;Jacob-Dazarola, Ruben/0000-0002-6693-803X;;;;31;0;0;0;15;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

The PD workshop was held in Chile and promoted the use of collaborative problem-solving activities in the classroom, through monthly sessions during the school year. Participant teachers met with a monitor to solve a new problem collaboratively, plan a problem-solving activity for their next lesson, and reflect on their activities from their previous lesson. The study documents the performance of two groups of students when solving non-routine mathematics problems in two similar and non-equal tests consisting of three problems each, before and after the year of application of the workshop. The first group of students was the experimental group with collaborative problem-solving activities, as proposed in the PD workshop. The second group was the control group, composed of students whose teachers followed traditional teaching. In the first part of the paper we present the results of pre- and post-tests in which the students in the experimental group improved their problem-solving performance in a significant way compared with the control group. In the second part, we present a sample of representation strategy used by successful students in both groups and we discuss, in general, student strategies in solving test problems.;"[Saadati, Farzaneh; Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile";;"Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile.";pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl;;Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003, PAI AFB-170001]; CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673]";The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions, which improved the paper considerably.

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile";;"Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.";darraghlisa3@gmail.com;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710;CIAE Project from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FB0003];I wish to acknowledge the Centre for Advanced Research in Education (CIAE, Santiago, Chile), for enabling the writing of this article due to funding from CIAE Project FB0003 from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica.;;92;69;71;2;31;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs' visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master's and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs' new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work.

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices.;"[Araya, Roberto; Dartnell, Pablo; Soto-Andrade, Jorge] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Araya, R (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Periodista Carrasco 75, Santiago, Chile.;robertoaraya@automind.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Soto-Andrade, Jorge/I-9424-2017";Soto-Andrade, Jorge/0000-0003-1120-2911;;;;0;5;7;0;9;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Thus, and by using implicative statistics, we were able to confirm the mental constructions and mechanisms considered in our genetic decomposition.

Through the use of an education production function, this article estimates the effect of variables related to health status, cognitive abilities, and demographic factors of Chilean mothers and children on the children's psychomotor development. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, which provides measures of children's biopsychosocial development through the application of a psychomotor development test (TEPSI) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (TVIP). In turn, the application of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) test to the mother allows an estimation of the role that her cognitive ability plays in the psychomotor development of the child. The results show that health, cognitive, and demographic variables are important factors in a child's biopsychosocial development. In the general model, the measures of cognitive ability have a greater impact than the other variables and, in all specific models, they are significant. Additionally, demographic variables and those related to the family environment have a greater impact than health variables. The child's attendance at preschool has a positive impact on psychomotor development, as measured by the TEPSI, and is even more important than the mother's employment status. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This achievement is measured using performance in standardized reading and mathematics tests. The study also evaluates the effect of a policy that recognizes and increases resources for special educational needs that had not yet been considered and improves education provision protocols for students with SEN. Using administrative data and standardized test scores, we constructed a panel that follows a cohort of students before and after the reform, determining for each individual and year whether the class to which he/she belongs has any students with SEN. Our identification strategy employs panel data with fixed effects at the school, individual, and time levels. Estimates show that, on average, having a peer with SEN in the classroom has a negative effect on the academic performance of students without SEN. However, these effects are small and decrease, or even vanish, once better inclusion policies are in place. These results suggest that the effect on peers is almost totally canceled when more resources are provided and when adequate treatment and support protocols are implemented.;"[Contreras, Dante; Brante, Miguel; Espinoza, Sebastian; Zuniga, Isabel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;Contreras, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;"contreras.dante@gmail.com; mbrante@fen.uchile.cl; seespinoza@fen.uchile.cl; isabel.zunigad@gmail.com";;Espinoza Rojas, Sebastian/0000-0002-8678-1201;"Centre for Social Conflict; Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]";Dante Contreras acknowledges the financial support provided by the Centre for Social Conflict and the Millennium Nucleus of Social Development, which is supported Cohesion Studies by the Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009).;;27;3;3;0;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0738-0593;1873-4871;;INT J EDUC DEV;Int.

Information was obtained from 328 fourth-grade students of nine schools and their respective mathematics teachers. The results show that the 77% of variability observed in the conceptualization of fractions could be attributed to student-level variables, while the remaining 23% would be attributable to school-level variables. On the other hand, 38% of the intra-school variance could be explained by students' previous knowledge, and virtually all the between-schools variance would be explained by the academic level of the school or, in 32% of cases, by the socioeconomic status of the school.

Methodology: an action-research methodology was used with three intervention phases: first, training in the use of graphic organisers of a group of academics who were expert in didactics; second, training of a group of pedagogy students in the methodological use of graphic organisers and, third, instructional design for the IGO's integration in secondary school curricula through these students' on-the-job training. Results: first, the application of a questionnaire on information and communication technology (ICT) skills shows that pedagogy students are good users of office automation applications and Internet but lack preparation for implementing meaningful learning experiences using ICT. Second, after the training process on interactive graphic organisers, each student prepared a curricular design incorporating the IGO as the teaching and learning process articulator. Third, as a result of implementing these curricular designs in schools, the pedagogy students valued this innovation in their didactic practices. Discussion: the findings demonstrate that the adequate integration of technology such as the IGO in the curriculum facilitates not only improvements in the teaching and learning process, from its design to its execution, but also constitutes an interesting didactic resource to develop basic cognitive skills, at the same time enhancing future teachers' ICT skills. Conclusions: the study's results confirm that the IGO's adequate curricular integration substantially improves the didactics of the discipline in which it is incorporated.";"[Ponce, Hector R.; Lopez, Mario J.; Labra, Juan E.; Toro, Oscar A.] Univ Santiago Chile, VirtualLab USACH, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Av LB OHiggins 3363 Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile.;hector.ponce@usach.cl;Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;;;;;31;1;2;2;23;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;;;REV EDUC;Rev.

Drawing on the concept of coloniality, this paper examines curricular and teaching practices in higher education that aim to decolonise Latin American universities, a particular topic that has been under-investigated. By means of a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis, 40 papers authored by at least one scholar affiliated to a Latin American university were examined. The analysis identified three levels of educational practices (macro, meso and micro) that revolve around the principle of intercultural indigenous education. Further, six essential criteria (cultural, epistemological, relational, ecological, economic, political) in decolonising university education are proposed. The paper concludes by offering insights about decolonising curricula and teaching practices in universities and the ways in which decolonial educational initiatives based on critical border thinking and socialisation of power might transform Latin American universities.;[Guzman Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile;;Valenzuela, CG (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;ANID-FONDECYT Chile [1200633];This work was supported by ANID-FONDECYT Chile: [Grant Number Project number 1200633].;;64;3;3;0;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1356-2517;1470-1294;;TEACH HIGH EDUC;Teach.

We proposed different criteria by which to characterize and study these improvement processes and, by applying them to our sample, we elaborated a typology of school improvement trajectories: we identified 4 different trajectories of school improvement. We called the first type restricted improvement because at its center is the management of processes that mainly target academic achievement tests; the second is incipient improvement, which is based on changes that restructure the school processes; the third identified trajectory are cases where school improvement is moving toward institutionalization, while the last are those cases where improvement has been already institutionalized and the schools have achieved high levels of educational effectiveness. We identified challenges that schools face at different stages of school improvement and discussed some related policy issues.";"[Bellei, Cristian; Vanni, Xavier; Valenzuela, Juan P.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Daniel] UNICEF, Educ Area, Santiago, Chile";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;cristianbellei@gmail.com;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Bellei, Cristián/D-9921-2015";"Bellei, Cristián/0000-0001-6963-7809; Vanni, Xavier/0000-0001-7245-6427";"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; PIA-CONICYT ANILLOComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS [SOC-1104]";"This work was supported by the PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [grant number BF0003]; PIA-CONICYT ANILLO [grant number SOC-1104].";;52;18;19;4;22;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

This analysis emerges from a considerate reflection on the teachings, and personal and professional milestones highlighted in the biogram. Both personally and professionally, a multiplicity of elements is observed in the life history of Maria Eliana, influencing the development of her leadership identity, particularly highlighting her self-recognition as a woman. This identity is oriented towards social justice, based on socio-emotional tools such as care, empathy, and participation; and understands and values the role these elements must take in Chilean education.

The online component adapts to teachers' time constraints, requires fewer trained professionals for its implementation, and enhances participants' opportunities to engage in the exploration and visualization of mathematical concepts and ideas. Also, the face-to-face component of this instruction modality allows spontaneous communication and collaborative construction of knowledge in real settings. This paper describes the instructional model of Suma y Sigue, a b-learning professional development program for primary and middle school teachers, which has been designed and implemented in Chile since 2015, aimed at developing mathematical knowledge for teaching. A particular feature of the program is its high-degree of self-directed autonomous online learning. We discuss how contextualized situations are articulated to create a learning environment in which teachers get involved in a progressive construction of multiple components of this knowledge. We also describe the implementation of the program, discussing the effects of scaling in teachers' experiences, and also how the information gathered upon implementation has led to changes in the training of instructors and in the program's instructional design.;"[Martinez, Salome; Guinez, Flavio; Zamora, Raul; Bustos, Sofia; Rodriguez, Becky] Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile";;Martinez, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile.;samartin@dim.uchile.cl;Martinez, Salome/F-4878-2013;;"Center for Mathematical Modeling [PIA AFB-170001]; Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018; UNESCO-Hamdan Award";Center for Mathematical Modeling, Grant PIA AFB-170001, Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018 and UNESCO-Hamdan Award.;;47;3;3;10;29;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

This reform is unprecedented, both for the size of the new intermediate-level services (Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica) and the escalation of their bureaucratic complexity, facing widespread organisational problems that cause high stress and labour suffering. We argue that improving emotional working conditions is necessary to accomplish pedagogical goals, but this dimension has received little attention. This article presents a follow-up study focused on school principals and professionals' emotional and occupational experiences that have worked in the initial two-and-half years of one of the first Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica created in the country. The qualitative analysis of interviews reveals how they make sense of organisational dilemmas while crafting solutions for facing structural shortcomings of new institutions. We understand their extraordinary commitment as 'philanthropic emotional work', driven by genuine care for children and the nation's future. However, in this effort, they also experience labour suffering and work overload, which may compromise their well-being and the long-term accomplishment of this reform's goals. These observations highlight the need for a reflexive improvement of this reform, recognising emotional work as a valuable resource but unsustainable without appropriate institutional support.;"[Sanfuentes, Matias] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Sanfuentes, Matias; Garreton, Matias] Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies COES, Santiago, Chile; [Garreton, Matias] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, DesignLab, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Diaz, Rocio] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montoya, Claudio] Univ Chile, Saberes Docentes Ctr, Santiago, Chile";;Sanfuentes, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.;msanfuentes@unegocios.cl;;;"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) - National Agency for Research and Development (ANID); ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) funded by National Agency for Research and Development (ANID).

Based on this, it discusses the possibilities of digital media production as a strategy for the self-expression of children and adolescents, particularly immersed in unequal and ethnically diverse educational contexts. The specific case of two Mapuche girls reveals complex ways of organizing and positioning their voices, where ` girl power' and ` post-girl power' discourses are relevant, but not so their ethnicity. The results show that television, with its main audiovisual genres, styles and stereotypes, appears clearly on the teenagers' creations, while the absence of Mapuche signs along the creation process and also into the digital stories seems to be related with two important features of the Chilean educational system: ethnic inequalities and its fierce attachment to neoliberalism.;[Valdivia, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile;;Valdivia, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile.;andrea.valdivia@u.uchile.cl;Valdivia, Andrea/K-1123-2016;;;;;31;5;5;0;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1743-9884;1743-9892;;LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL;Learn.

To address this problem, researchers have developed models to structure the process. However, we maintain that it is first necessary to understand how students actually search for information online when solving an information problem and compare their behaviours with the available literature. To do this, we collected and analysed the data on a laboratory setting of 41 students while they solved 16 information problems using the internet and expressed aloud what they were thinking whilst solving them. We identified 21 categories of actions, grouped into 9 activity types associated with four information search processes, showing that some of the students' stereotyped search behaviours are in fact conscious decisions based on the requirements of the task and the answers found. The results also show that searching for information on the internet can not only vary depending on the task's requirements, but also on the number of iterations students need to perform to reach an answer. These findings provide some evidence that challenge the assumption that students simply lack the competencies to search for information on the internet; rather, it seems that they show an awareness of different strategies, which they decide to use based on the context and purpose of the task, making their search behaviour more elaborated and complex than is usually portrayed by researchers in the field.

Literature suggests that inclusion takes place when barriers are removed, allowing participation. However, scholars agree that teachers still struggle with pedagogical practices in inclusive classrooms. Hansen (Hansen, J.H.2012. Limits to Inclusion. International Journal of Inclusive Education 16 (1): 89-98) contends that teachers establish limits to inclusion in order to manage the level of diversity, arguing that the limits depend on the teacher's understanding of disability. This article examines German secondary school teachers, who reflect on inclusive pedagogical practices and their relationship to learners with disabilities. The analysis shows that most teachers add levels of complexity when constructing the disability's identity. Teachers struggled with the notion of limitation associated with disability and with the discovery of the other, with new learning skills and abilities. Interactions with learners with a disability open new venues to practice inclusion and encourage participation, but this requires a change in practices; yet, not all teachers feel prepared to do that. Teachers offered various rationales on why they applied limits to inclusion; those rationales are rooted in how they interpret disability and their own roles as teachers.";"[Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile; [Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile";;"Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile.; Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile.";johanna.sagner@ufrontera.cl;;;;;;38;1;1;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

However, the assessments of said courses are criticized in terms of their validity. This paper is an exploratory case study regarding the validity of the assessment system used in a semi presential web-based course. The course uses an authentic assessment system that includes online forums, online tests, self-evaluations, and the assessment of e-learner processes and products by a tutor, peers, and an expert. The validity of the system was checked using internal and external criteria. The results show that the authentic assessment system addresses technical problems, especially regarding reliability of instruments.

Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven's (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177-211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator's process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices. Recommendations for the education of PD facilitators in large-scale initiatives are provided.";"[Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Catholic Univ Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile";;Valoyes-Chavez, L (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile.;lvaloyes@uct.cl;;Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094;"ANID/FONDEF [ID14I20338]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; PIA AFB [170001]";This work was supported by ANID/FONDEF under Grant #ID14I20338.

However, learning analytics is part of a young community and its developments deserve further exploration. Some critical stances claim that learning analytics tends to underplay the complexity of teaching-learning processes. By means of both a bibliometric and a content analysis, this paper examines the publication patterns on learning analytics in higher education and their main challenges. 385 papers that were published in WoScc and SciELO indexes between 2013 and 2019 were identified and analysed. Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students' learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community. Within both communities, though, it seems that the focus is more on analytics than on learning.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Gomez-Gonzalez, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile; [Rojas-Murphy Tagle, Andres] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lorca-Vyhmeister, Alejandro] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Rojas-Murphy Tagle, Andres Felipe/0000-0001-5853-9939";"FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1200633, 1161413]; ANID-Chile";This work was supported by ANID-Chile, Fondecyt projects 1200633 and 1161413.;;61;6;6;9;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2365-9440;;;INT J EDUC TECHNOL H;Int.

Relying on a mixed-method design, we gathered data from individual and group interviews and an online survey conducted with 268 ECEC teachers. Drawn from both a priori and emergent categories, our findings reveal that participants held four paradoxical views on the new System: salary justice versus monetizing of the profession; professional teaching recognition versus counter-pedagogical identity, rigorous evaluation versus inappropiate evaluation instruments, and palpable individual career advancement versus doubtful field development. These paradoxes show that ECEC teachers have a positive global view of the new STPD, despite their perception of its individualistic and counter-ECEC pedagogical nature, suggesting a claim for their right to professional development and decent working conditions, as well as a criticism of the STPD's neoliberal foundation.";"[Pardo, Marcela] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Adlerstein, Cynthia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Pardo, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile.;marcelapardo@ciae.uchile.cl;Adlerstein, Cynthia/AAV-8228-2020;Adlerstein, Cynthia/0000-0001-7174-0100;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761]];  [FB0003]";"This work was supported by the MINEDUC & UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761];ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003].";;42;1;2;2;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0957-5146;1472-4421;;EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON;Early Years;OCT 19;2020;40;4-5;;;;;387;399;;10.1080/09575146.2020.1736008;;MAR 2020;13;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;PH5MJ;WOS:000518312700001;;;;;2022-04-06;

Considering variable trends in mining, academic institutions with geology programs in Chile were analyzed to provide an evaluation of their current state and projected development across the country. Through the compilation of 5 years of data, a comparison was undertaken in relation to the age of the programs, their respective lifespans, geographic distributions, vacancies, annual entry fees, yearly tuitions, scores on admission tests, curricula, and human resources and infrastructure. The main results indicate the following: most of the new programs are located in or near the Metropolitan Region due to population trends rather than the locations of mines, the actual number of new students may double the total amount of vacancies, the student program fee tends to increase with time and varies between the programs with no apparent relationship to quality, there exists a strong variation in scores needed to enter into the geology programs, and currently there are more individuals studying geology than total graduates. When considering the unfavorable projections for mining in Chile, it is conclusive that this career will not yield the anticipated benefits for graduates unless new, more diverse professional opportunities develop in other sectors.;"[Tapia, J.; Tolorza, V.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Duran, P.] Univ Antofagasta, Dept Ingn Minas, Fac Ingn, Antofagasta, Chile; [Poblete, N.] PGS SPA, Huerfanos 1055,Of 503, Santiago, Chile";;Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.;joseline.tapia@uach.cl;Tapia, Joseline/AAH-4000-2019;"Tapia, Joseline/0000-0002-1516-2622; Tolorza, Violeta/0000-0002-0281-4476";"CONICYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [79150070]; FONDECYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160843]";"This work would not be possible without the valuable help of the Group of Education in Geology of the Geological Society of Chile.

Counter stories describe how teachers use their professional experience to confront those mega narratives composed of dominant educational policies that impinge upon their pedagogical practices. The mega narrative described in this study as a citizenship education mega policy narrative is composed by citizenship educational guidelines that have become influenced by other market-driven educational policies, and is not only present in Chile but has also been influenced by policies coming from countries such as England and the US. Therefore, the discussions that emerge from these counter stories on the nature of this mega narrative and the ways through which teachers can confront it through their teaching, and the implications that all this has for the field of citizenship education, do not only fill a gap in Chilean research but also contribute to discussions on counter and mega narratives in the field of citizenship education within a wider international scope.;[Cavieres-Fernandez, Eduardo] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Vina Del Mar, Chile;;Cavieres-Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;ecavieres-cea@upla.cl;;Cavieres-Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0003-3199-5090;FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121156];This work was supported by FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico) [grant number 11121156].;;85;2;4;1;14;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0022-0272;1366-5839;;J CURRICULUM STUD;J.

Following review of the available literature, we classify the causes of the lack of impact on students' attainment in four dimensions: (1) the design and implementation of ICT in educational settings; (2) the evaluation of its impact; (3) the scaling up of these kinds of innovations; and (4) the cost-effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning environments. Based on this evidence, we proposed the evolutionary development model (EDM), which aims to produce a cost-effective and sustainable ICT for education (ICT4E) programme in three steps: efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. In each step, one component of the programme is built and validated in real educational settings. Therefore, the resultant ICT4E programme is ready to be replicated across the school system. We also show how the EDM guided the development of a programme based on mobile computer supported collaborative learning, known as Eduinnova.

The aim is to describe ongoing strategies and learn from practical experiences in this field. The cases analyzed reveal that school-level evaluations and collective incentives adapt better to the characteristics of the educational process and the potential for teamwork, while individual evaluations pose some difficulties. Several evaluation systems currently in use emphasize educational inputs and, in some cases, mainly compliance with rules and procedures, irrespective of education results (output). If the factors considered in assessing school performance do not correlate well with educational achievement, the incentives vanish. Hence, the importance of emphasizing output and ensuring that if measures are included for inputs and processes, these must line up with educational achievement.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.;"[Marques, Maira; Ochoa, Sergio F.; Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia; Gutierrez, Francisco J.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile";;Marques, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile.;"mmarques@dcc.uchile.cl; sochoa@dcc.uchile.cl; cecilia@dcc.uchile.cl; frgutier@dcc.uchile.cl";SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/Q-8247-2019;SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/0000-0001-5347-1664;"Project Fondef IDeAComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [IT13I20010]; Conicyt Chile (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional) [2012-21120544]";This work was supported by the Project Fondef IDeA under Grant IT13I20010.

In this context, this paper reviews their experience concerning practical robotics courses for children developed since 2000. More than 700 children and 90 school teachers have already attended these robotics courses, and the model is now being implemented in several schools and institutions in Chile. The robotics courses evolved to their present form from ideas developed during the late 1990s, mostly in the United States. Some preliminary assessment data is presented to support this approach.

Better results were obtained in a course where reasoning and deduction capacities were important than there were in a technical one where students were required to learn specific knowledge and apply it. A CANA design is described that will permit its reuse in various instructional scenarios. This design is defined as a collaborative learning activity pattern and is specified using IMS Learning Design, an established method of learning scenario description.

Thus, outreach is becoming increasingly important, and activities with schoolchildren are being extensively carried out as part of this effort. In this context, robotics is a very attractive and effective tool for fostering interest in science and technology among children and young people and for attracting them toward engineering. In this article, experience with different robotics-centered outreach activities in the Universidad de Chile (UCH), Santiago, Chile, will be shared. These activities include robotics courses for children, social robots as keynote speakers, mechatronics design courses, and participation in international robotics competitions, which contribute synergistically to the goal of attracting students to UCH's Electrical Engineering (EE) Department. Owing to its novelty, the use of social robots as keynote speakers for schoolchildren will be described in detail. Experimental results that demonstrate how sophisticated social robots can be used to foster the interest of young people in technology will be shown. Altogether, more than 3000 schoolchildren have participated directly in these outreach activities here in Chile, creating a sizeable impact in this country.;"[Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 8370451, Chile; [Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier] Univ Chile, Adv Min Technol Ctr, Santiago 8370451, Chile";;Ruiz-del-Solar, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 8370451, Chile.;jruizd@ing.uchile.cl;Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier/H-5214-2013;Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier/0000-0003-2965-633X;"Chilean Government; Millennium Nucleus Center for Web Research, Chile [P04-067-F]";This work was supported by the Chilean Government under the Explora-CONICYT Program and by the Millennium Nucleus Center for Web Research, Chile, under Grant P04-067-F.;;16;24;24;1;12;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

These examples are easier to understand and display a richer behavior than the ones commonly used from mechanics, electronics, hydrodynamics, lasers, chemical reactions, and population dynamics. In particular, an electric motor driven by a dynamo can display stationary, Hopf, and codimension-two bifurcations by tuning the driving speed of the dynamo and the electric current in the stator of the electric motor. When the dynamo is driven at constant torque instead of constant rotation rate, chaotic reversals of the generated current and of the angular rotation of the motor are observed. Simple deterministic models are presented which capture the observed dynamical regimes.

The PBL learning methodology helped students search for real-world problems, develop complex solutions, and generate synergy among team members. The main role of the professor was to advise, guide and motivate the students throughout the course. The pedagogic innovation with active learning methodologies offered the professor the opportunity to create a dynamic motivating learning environment based on experiences. Each undergraduate engineering student had the opportunity to develop the skills and techniques of their profession: teamwork, proactivity, innovation, and leadership.

Methods: A survey was applied to a sample of 316 persons in the principal cities of southern Chile distributed with proportional attachment per city. Results: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed an adequate level of internal consistency and a good fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.071, goodness-of-fit index = 0.95, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.92) to the SWFL data (1-dimensional). The evaluation of a causal covariance structure analysis model composed of the SWFL as antecedent construct and the SWLS as consequent construct indicates a medium level of relation between the 2 constructs.

In particular, we focus the work on the realization of phase-only gratings and phase-only spiral phases for the generation of vortex beams, beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). Despite the extensive activity in this field, its experimental implementation for educational purposes is limited because it requires the use of very expensive high-resolution liquid-crystal on silicon (LCOS) SLMs. Here, we show that a low-cost experimental implementation can be done with older TNLC technology. However, these devices, intended for display applications, exhibit rather limited optical phase modulation properties in comparison with modern LCOS devices, such as a very low range of phase modulation and a general coupled intensity modulation. However, we show that a precise characterization of their retardance parameters permits their operation in useful modulation configurations. As examples, we include one continuous phaseonly configuration useful for reproducing the optimal triplicator phase grating, and a binary p-phase modulation. We include experiments with the realization of different phase diffraction gratings, and their combination with spiral phase patterns and lens functions to generate a variety of vortex beams.;"[Cofre, Aaron; Moreno, Ignacio] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Ciencia Mat Opt & Tecnol Elect, E-03202 Elche, Spain; [Garcia-Martinez, Pascuala] Univ Valencia, Dept Opt, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain; [Vargas, Asticio] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Fis, Temuco, Chile";;Garcia-Martinez, P (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Opt, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain.;pascuala.garcia@uv.es;"García-Martínez, Pascuala/E-3603-2012; Vargas, Asticio/H-9123-2015";"García-Martínez, Pascuala/0000-0002-8537-281X; Moreno, Ignacio/0000-0002-1550-0601";"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of SpainSpanish Government; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission [FIS2015-66328-C3-3-R]; Generalitat Valenciana, Santiago Grisolia ProgramGeneralitat Valenciana [2015/073]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151290]";We acknowledge financial support from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain and FEDER funds (grant ref.: FIS2015-66328-C3-3-R).

Using the properties of the rotation matrix and associated operators, we show that it is possible to find an exact analytical solution to a number of problems where the differential equation of motion depends on the velocity. First, we apply our method to the well-known cases of a particle under the influence of the Lorentz force and Coriolis force, providing the complete analytical solution in each case for the motion of the particle in three dimensions. We also show that the complete solution can be obtained when the centrifugal force is included, showing the applicability to cases where there is simultaneous dependence on the position and velocity. This method, which is not currently discussed in a typical course in elementary mechanics, provides an alternative approach to the traditional methods that are used to solve these types of problems.

In previous research, concept keyboards (CK) were successfully used to implement a software system supporting the learning of classical algorithms, like QuickSort and Dijkstra's algorithm, among others. Traditional visualization software normally offers the learner an animated representation of the algorithm with the possibility of controlling the execution of the right steps, giving the learner a more or less passive role. Concept keyboards allow the learner to control the execution of the algorithm by deciding which function should be performed when. Four cryptographic protocols were implemented and tested (Wide Mouth Frog, Feige-Fiat-Shamir, Needham-Schroeder and Kerberos V). A it initial evaluation confirmed that the use of the CK fosters comprehension of the algorithms, facilitates the learning process and stimulates the learners' activity.;"[Baloian, Nelson] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Cs, Santiago, Chile; [Luther, Wolfram] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany";;Baloian, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Cs, Santiago, Chile.;"nbaloian@dcc.uchile.cl; luther@inf.uni-due.de";Baloian, Nelson/J-3718-2016;Baloian, Nelson/0000-0003-1608-6454;FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1060797];we thank our master's thesis students for their valuable contributions.

This study consisted of two phases starting with designing a chemistry education for the sustainable development-based learning environment of reaction kinetics, followed by a case study in which students' perceptions toward learning chemistry by solving a real environmental problem using digital resources, spreadsheets, and an active learning environment, were explored. First, we designed a Socio-Scientific Environmental Chemistry module centered on the sorption kinetic processes of herbicides in volcanic ash derived soils (VADS) and their potential to pollute groundwater. The objective of the learning module was to contribute to the development of sustainability skills, to promote learning of contextualized chemistry knowledge, and to develop scientific skills. This module employs spreadsheets as computational tools in chemistry to model real sorption kinetic data of herbicides in VADS. The learning module was designed for one section of two Analytical Chemistry courses and one Physical Chemistry course of an undergraduate chemistry teacher-training program. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in each course, and students' perceptions were gathered using the focus group technique. The sample was of 22 students distributed into three focus groups. The data collected were analyzed and categorized through qualitative content analysis using the Technological Pedagogical Science Knowledge (TPASK) framework. On the basis of our findings, the students acquired contextualized chemistry knowledge and develop skills and knowledge related to using digital resources and spreadsheets in a scientific context. Besides, the preservice chemistry teachers' knowledge of pedagogy allowed them to develop some elements of their pedagogical science knowledge and TPASK. This case study shows that the problem-based learning approach offers great potential in supporting a learning environment suitable to working with spreadsheets to solve real-environment problems in chemistry education.;"[Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Jorquera-Moreno, Barbara; Druker-Ibanez, Sofia; Hernandez-Ramos, Jose] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Lab Quim Mat, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] CEDENNA, Ctr Dev Nanosci & Nanotechnol, Santiago 9170124, Chile; [Diaz-Arce, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Philosophy & Educ, Dept Special Educ, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, Helsinki 00014, Finland";;Caceres-Jensen, L (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile.;lyzethly.caceres@umce.cl;"Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017";"Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Hernandez Ramos, Jose/0000-0001-8871-8495; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X";"Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [DIUMCE FGI 36-17, FGI-46-18]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 11110421, CEDENNA FB-0807]";This work was supported through DIUMCE FGI 36-17 and FGI-46-18 (Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile), FONDECYT 11110421 (CONICYT, Chile), CEDENNA FB-0807 (CONICYT, Chile).

We discuss the various experimental and theoretical aspects of this classic problem. Careful time-resolved force measurements allow us to determine the differences between the idealized problem and its implementation in the laboratory. We observe that, in spite of the upward force exerted by the pan on the chain, the free end at the top falls faster than a freely falling body. Because a real chain exhibits a finite minimum radius of curvature, the contact at the bottom results in a tensional force, which pulls the falling part downward.

In an effort to balance the rigorous academic technical requirements of an engineering degree, entrepreneurship programs leverage both curricular and co-curricular programming, offering students different paths to entrepreneurship development. However, little is known about the distribution of these opportunities amongst different groups of students. The purpose of this investigation is to examine whether the pathways to entrepreneurship education are influenced by student characteristics. Institution and participation data of 1,018 undergraduate students were collected from an entrepreneurship program anchored in a large, Midwest, public research university, college of engineering, center for entrepreneurship. Logistic regressions were used to examine the differences and similarities between students enrolling an entrepreneurship curricular program and their participation in co-curricular activities. Our data indicates that gender, nationality, and grade point average (GPA) are key factors in determining the type of entrepreneurship participation students choose to pursue in the university environment. We also found evidence of the curricular program acting as a gateway to engagement with entrepreneurship beyond the classroom. These data suggest that entrepreneurship programs should be cognizant of the influencers as well as the student pathways when developing programs to attract a diverse student base.;"[Huang-Saad, Aileen] Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Huang-Saad, Aileen] Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Ctr Entrepreneurship, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Sch Engn & Sci, Beauchef 850, Santiago 8370448, Chile";;"Huang-Saad, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Huang-Saad, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Ctr Entrepreneurship, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.";"aileenhs@umich.edu; scelis@ing.uchile.cl";Huang-Saad, Aileen/AAA-7786-2020;"Huang-Saad, Aileen/0000-0002-0300-8425; Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608";;;;53;8;9;1;21;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Mothers and children were surveyed in their homes or at schools in Temuco, Chile. Participants: A total of 300 mothers (average age, 41.6 years) and their adolescent children (average age, 13.2 years; 48.7% female). Main Outcome Measures: Maternal feeding practices using the abbreviated Family Food Behavior Survey (AFFBS),life satisfaction, food-related and family life satisfaction, diet quality, and eating habits. Analysis: Principal component factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to verify Family Food Behavior Survey components in mother and adolescent subsamples. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify profiles. Results: Three AFFBS components were detected: maternal control of child snacking behavior, maternal presence during eating, and child involvement in food consumption. Cluster analysis identified 3 mother-adolescent dyad profiles with different food-related parenting practices (P <= .001), mother (P <= .05) and child (P <= .001) diet quality, frequency of shared family meals (P <= .001), and mother (P <= .001) and child (P <= .05) life satisfaction levels. Conclusions and Implications: Results indicated that maternal well-being increased with an increased frequency of shared mealtime. Significantly, in contrast to the findings of previous studies, greater control over child eating habits was shown to affect adolescent well-being positively.

Developing quality standards and measuring learning levels can be difficult enough from campus to campus within a particular country. However, exporting and adapting such standards across countries and educational traditions and cultures is even more challenging. The present paper describes the portability of one system of assessment developed at a U.S. institution as applied to two engineering faculties in Chile. The process followed during the initial training and development provides some good insights into how assessment and quality improvement processes can be quickly implemented. However, the implementation required cultural shifts in how the program approached, and administrators and faculty thought about, assessment for quality improvement. The experience in Chile provides some lessons on the opportunities and potential pitfalls of carrying out such a process in other countries and programs.;"[Sheahan, T.

The present study was designed to measure changes in medical students' attitudes following a psychiatric clerkship in a developing country. Medical students from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile were interviewed before and after a psychiatric clerkship using a translation into Spanish of an attitude-to-psychiatry questionnaire used previously in the UK. The results were similar to those reported from developed countries. There was a marked early improvement in students' attitudes following their psychiatric clerkship which gradually faded over 3 years.

Research has generally focused on a single type of loss, with only a handful of studies exploring the accumulation of losses in old age and examining which and how many losses are experienced, and how intense they are. The lack of instruments that reflect the diversity of the losses that individuals can sustain at this stage of life makes it difficult to accumulate knowledge in this field, since it is not possible to characterize this experience or establish associations with other significant variables. Based on a prior categorization of six types of losses, developed upon the basis of reports by older adults, we sought to construct and validate a Scale of Losses Experienced in Old Age (SLO). This scale underwent semantic validation, followed by content validation. Afterward, for the construct validation process, it was administered to a pilot sample of 249 middle-income community-dwelling older adults. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded adequate values (RMSEA = 0.060, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.961, SRMR = 0.075), with internal consistency also being suitable (ordinal alpha = 0.856). These values warrant recommending the use of the SLO, since it offers a view of losses in old age that is both broad and detailed, thus facilitating the production of cumulative and comparable knowledge in the field of psychogerontology while also making it possible to establish interdisciplinary connections.;"[Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Gerosci Ctr Brain Hlth & Metab GERO, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Mayor, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile; [Assar, Rodrigo; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Biomed Sci ICBM, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Arnold-Cathalifaud, Marcelo] Univ Chile, Dept Anthropol, Fac Social Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neuropsychol & Clin Neurosci Lab Lannec, Physiopathol Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, East Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Hosp Salvador, Dept Neurol, Memory & Neuropsychiat Clin CMYN, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Lillo, Patricia] Univ Chile, South Neurol Dept, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Desarrollo, Dept Med, Neurol Serv, Clin Alemana, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Aging, Santiago, Chile";;Thumala-Dockendorff, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile.;dthumala@uchile.cl;Slachevsky, Andrea/P-4039-2014;Slachevsky, Andrea/0000-0001-6285-3189;"MULTI-PARTNER CONSORTIUM TO EXPAND DEMENTIA RESEARCH IN LATIN AMERICA (ReDLat) - National Institutes of Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01AG057234]; Alzheimer's AssociationAlzheimer's Association [SG-20-725707-ReDLat]; Rainwater Foundation; Global Brain Health Institute; GBHI;  [ANID/FONDAP/15150012];  [ANID/Fondecyt/1191726]";"This work was supported by ANID/FONDAP/15150012.

J;Pacheco, CS;;;;Silva Pacheco, Cristian;;;Art Education for the Development of Complex Thinking Metacompetence: A Theoretical Approach;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"art; art education; metacompetence; complex thinking";COGNITION;This article proposes to explore the relationships between art education and the development of complex thinking (proposed as metacompetence in this study) from a theoretical perspective. This is an approach that arises from contemporary conceptions about art, which is an intrinsic relationship between the artwork and the creative and critical character towards representation systems. Emphasising the definition of complex thinking proposed by Mathew Lipman serves as a guiding axis to try to establish the cognitive processes that compose it. Among the main findings is that the development of complex thinking and cognition occurs through action and interaction with the environment, thus linking to the notions of 'situated competence' and the 'complex approach to competences'. By including cognitive and metacognitive processes, it allows us to postulate complex thinking as metacompetence. In addition, it is proposed that the use of learning methodologies (under a competence-based approach) could contribute to an art education where students produce artistic works that involve critical, creative processes or divergent results. It is also necessary that both the curriculum and the teachers encourage an expanded and interdisciplinary vision, understanding that art is not circumscribed to a specific discipline.;"[Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile";;"Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile.";crsilvap@utalca.cl;;;PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca;This study was supported by PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca.;;36;3;3;2;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1476-8062;1476-8070;;INT J ART DES EDUC;Int.

We use the revealed preferences of students for college major choice by taking advantage of Chile's Centralized Admission System, and estimate a nested logit model to predict the first preference of applicants. We find that males apply to selective programs even when they are marginal candidates, while equally qualified female candidates tend to apply less often to these programs. Using counterfactual exercises, we conclude that to successfully address the gender gap, along with promoting females' participation in STEM careers, we must increase males' willingness to consider non-STEM fields.

On a conceptual level, it outlines a model for understanding how TV operates as a social mediator in the event of natural disasters, and at the practical level, it recommends measures that can be used to optimize the role of TV and its ideal social function in contexts of crisis. This model views TV intervention as both self-centered, that is, driven by its reproduction as a media consumption company; and socially-centered, designed to respond swiftly and accurately to the social requirements that emerge in crisis situations. The suggested model is to be contrasted with the results of a research study conducted by the National TV Council of Chile that explored the role of TV broadcasting after the earthquake in February 2010. According to the results of the study, audiences value the amount of information broadcasted by TV networks but perceive that the predominance of its self-centered function creates a problem: the logic of the 'spectacle' is prevalent and exacerbates the audience's emotions. The primary purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy to recommend how TV and its associate services can respond to a crisis situation while respecting the tragedy of natural disasters.";"[Dolores Souza, Ma] Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile; [Dolores Souza, Ma] Programa Televis Educ Novasur Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Martinez, Victor] Univ Chile, Dept Psicol, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile";;Souza, MD (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile.;"msouza@cntv.cl; vimartin@vtr.net";;;;;;7;5;5;0;13;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2011;18;36;;;;;69;76;;10.3916/C36-2011-02-07;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";716RY;WOS:000286992400009;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

This study was undertaken with the aim of establishing whether this kind of exposure precludes the reutilization of questions in future years. In all, 197 questions were used more than once from 1994 to 1998. Considering the first and last time they were included in a test, 50 (25%) increased their difficulty, 39 (20%) diminished it, and 108 (55%) remained unchanged. The correlation coefficient between the percentage of students that answered correctly each question the first and last time they were used was 0.51 (p < 0.001).

In particular, the previous literature has compared student effort under relative and absolute grading systems, but the results are mixed and the implications of the models have not been empirically tested. In this paper, I build a model where students maximize their utility by choosing effort. I investigate how student effort changes when there is a change in the grading system from absolute grading to relative grading. I use a unique dataset from college students in Chile who faced a change in the grading system to test the implications of my model. My model predicts that, for low levels of uncertainty, low-ability students exert less effort with absolute grading, and high-ability students exert more effort with absolute grading. The data confirm that there is a change in the distribution of effort.;[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile;;Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.;vparedes@fen.uchile.cl;;;"CEPPE, project Conicyt [CIE-01-4]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PAI 7912010032]";I would like to thank CEPPE, project CIE-01-4 Conicyt, for providing financial support.

Those students were being exposed to the same curricular experience, but they were in different stages of medical training by this time. At the moment of the study they were at the end of the first, third, fifth and seventh year of medical training. The assessment was done using the Lancaster Inventory of Learning Approach. It was answered by a total of 143 students (100%). The four groups showed very similar scores without significant differences between them. According to the final results the meaning orientation was predominant in all the groups. This orientation corresponded, to the deep approach to learning of Newble & Entwistle (1986). Data were assessed statistically through analysis of variance and Scheffe test for multiple comparison.;;;MONTECINOS, PB (corresponding author), UNIV LA FRONTERA, FAC MED, MED EDUC OFF, POB 54D, TEMUCO, CHILE.;;;;;;;0;6;6;0;0;CARFAX PUBL CO;ABINGDON;PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE;0142-159X;;;MED TEACH;Med.

Between 2002 and 2011 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1282 schools closed -roughly one-tenth of the current stock- and 2350 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which contains individual students' academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 49 and 68% (1.8 and 2.5 percentage points). Also, school exit implies between 3.9 and 4.4 percentage points increase in the probability of grade retention in fifth grade.;"[Grau, Nicolas; Hojman, Daniel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile";;"Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.; Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.";amizala@dii.uchile.cl;"Hojman, Daniel A/N-4178-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013";"Hojman, Daniel A/0000-0001-7768-0065; Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677";"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; PIA-CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003]";We thank the Chilean Ministry of Education for providing the data.

The use of this tool has benefits for both the producer of the movie, as well as for brands and/or products. There is currently no consensus in the academic world on how to measure the effectiveness of this communication tool. There is scarce scientific evidence in Latin America, and in Chile this format has been used in television programs, and only recently in movies. The objective of this research is to study the influence of placement in movies on explicit memory (unaided recall and brand awareness) and implicit memory (purchase intention) through the implementation of an experiment performed on a sample of 205 Chilean college students, according to the different types of placement in movies: brands as part of the background, used by a main character, and connected with the plot. The results indicate that the higher the degree of integration of the brand with the plot of the film, the higher the probability of stimulating the explicit memory of participants and thereby unaided recall and brand awareness, providing empirical evidence regarding the learning of consumer behavior through placement as a communication tool.;"[Valenzuela-Fernandez, Leslier; Martinez-Troncoso, Carolina; Yanez-Wieland, Felipe] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile";;Valenzuela-Fernandez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.;"lvalenzuela@unegocios.cl; cmartinezt@uft.cl; fyanezw@fen.uchile.cl";;Martinez Troncoso, Carolina Andrea/0000-0001-8467-4317;;;;39;7;7;1;19;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN 1;2015;22;44;;;;;169;176;;10.3916/C44-2015-18;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";AX8KR;WOS:000347158900018;;Green Accepted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Surveys to parents and previous work suggested that families rank the distance of the school from their home as the most important factor for choosing a school. They also suggest that parents largely ignore the results of standardized tests. We use a novel data-set which includes precise measures of the distance between homes and schools to analyze the determinants of school choice in Chile. Economic theory suggests, and the estimations confirm, that parents consider quality and the location when choosing schools. The paper quantifies the relevant trade-offs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies the impact of same gender teachers on academic achievement for a large sample of 8th graders in Chile. I provide evidence that girls benefit from being assigned to female teachers, while there is no negative effect on boys. More importantly, I provide evidence that the positive effect is due to role model effects and not to teacher bias effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2011, Chile experienced massive mobilizations for seven months. These were perhaps the most important social protests in Chile's recent history, where young people played a leading role in the discussion over education. During these events, Facebook was one of the digital social networks most widely used by the mobilized organizations. In FECH's case, it utilized Facebook mainly to call for protest actions, to highlight the achievements of the movement, and to indicate their opponents. However, most of the content published on this Facebook page was produced by traditional media, showing that conventional communication strategies of social movements are interrelated with new innovative practices. Therefore, this article rejects technological determinism, because it does not recognize the complex characteristics of student and youth movements.;Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile;;Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile.;ccabalin@uchile.cl;Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014;Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478;;;;34;47;50;3;74;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JUL 1;2014;22;43;;;;;25;33;;10.3916/C43-2014-02;;;9;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";AK0UB;WOS:000338130200004;;Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Evidence from GPA-based university admission in Chile;ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;"College admissions; Rankings; Incentives; Moral hazard";AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION;"The use of students' within-school grade point average (GPA) ranking has emerged as a means to increase admission rates of both segregated minorities and high-performance individuals. Based on that idea, Chile's centralized university admission system introduced, in 2012, a GPA-ranking score variable. In contrast to other ranking-based criteria, the Chilean version ostensibly avoids classmate competition by basing scores on past cohorts' GPAs. Also, the GPA-ranking is similar to an added bonus to the GPA score, and it does not replace the national admission exam. Such design incentivizes both academic effort and GPA inflation. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the Chilean reform on GPA and achievement. Our results, based on difference-in-differences and simulated instruments methods, suggest that: (i) GPA increased across the entire distribution of students; (ii) GPA increases were larger in schools where the new variable presented greater incentives; and (iii) GPA increases were unrelated to improvements in achievement. We interpret the results as evidence that the Chilean ranking variable caused GPA inflation rather than increased learning.";"[Fajnzylber, Eduardo; Leon, Tomas] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile";;Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile.;"eduardo.fajnzylber@uai.cl; blara@utalca.cl";;Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741;;;;16;3;3;2;9;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

I build a rank-order tournament model where high school students decide their level of effort and whether or not to take the college admissions test, considering how those decisions affect their future university admissions chances. Using administrative Chilean data for the 2009 college admissions process, I structurally estimate the parameters of the model. Two affirmative action policies are simulated: (a) SES-quota system, which imposes the population's socioeconomic group (SES) distribution for each university; (b) increasing the weight of high school GPA in the admission final score. These simulations support the claim that affirmative action in college admission may boost the amount of academic effort exerted by high school students. I also find that while increasing the weight of high school GPA is more effective in boosting students' academic effort in high school, the SES-quota system is more efficient in allocating the best students to the best universities.";[Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile;;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile.;ngrau@fen.uchile.cl;;;Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009];I thank Diego Amador, Sina Ates, Garth Baughman, Flavio Cunha, Hanming Fang, Tzuo Hann Law, Andres Hojman, Daniel Hojman, Zehao Hu, Tomas Rau, Minchul Shin, Petra Todd, Juan Pablo Torres-Martinez and Kenneth I.

However, the interaction between the levels has not been elaborated. Furthermore, it is known that people may draw either from intrinsic or extrinsic experiences to construct their identities depending on their cultural environment. Thus, affective individual and interindividual levels seem to interact with culture. In this study we focus on the significance of and the interaction between the individual and the interindividual levels of affect. This is done with respect to 2 different types of countries (Finland and Chile) to include cultural effect. We use questionnaire-based data and pupils' drawings of their mathematics class to find out about their individual and interindividual experiences. By using mixed data, we are not only getting a wider picture of pupils' affect but we can also avoid the most typical errors made in the cross-cultural comparisons as the pupils' own voice is strengthened. The main finding in the study is that the 2 affective levels are not congruent and that the incongruence appears differently in different types of cultures.;"[Tuohilampi, Laura; Laine, Anu; Hannula, Markku S.] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Varas, Leonor] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Tuohilampi, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;"laura.tuohilampi@helsinki.fi; anu.laine@helsinki.fi; markku.hannula@helsinki.fi; mlvaras@dim.uchile.cl";"Hannula, Markku/AAF-6362-2020; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Laine, Anu/AAE-7083-2020";"Laine, Anu/0000-0003-3881-8134; Hannula, Markku/0000-0003-4979-7711; Tuohilampi, Laura/0000-0002-8117-4269";;;;41;3;3;0;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

The model revealed the following factors: Disciplinary Measures, School Violence, Teacher-Student Violence and Encouragement of Classroom Participation. It revealed the teacher's role in modelling and setting behaviour rules based on respect, equity, justice and inclusion. From this perspective, managing discipline and developing social-emotional competences in associated issues like coping, classroom management, mediation, conflict resolution and positive disciplinary measures should be included in pre-service and in-service teacher training.;"[Bravo-Sanzana, Monica; Salvo-Garrido, Sonia; Miranda-Vargas, Horacio] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Bangdiwala, Shrikant I.] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada";;Bravo-Sanzana, M (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Lab Invest Ciencias Sociales, Nucleo Cient Tecnol Ciencias Sociales & Humanidad, Temuco 01145, Chile.;monicaviviana.bravo@ufrontera.cl;"Salvo, Sonia/ABD-6352-2020; SANZANA, MÓNICA MBS BRAVO/Q-2263-2016";"SANZANA, MÓNICA MBS BRAVO/0000-0003-4942-742X; Salvo-Garrido, Sonia/0000-0002-9567-2285";FONDECYT-INICIACION, CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [11150665];This study was conducted with project 11150665 funded by FONDECYT-INICIACION, CONICYT. / Esta investigacion se ha realizado dentro del proyecto 11150665 subvencionado por FONDECYT-INICIACION, CONICYT.;;57;2;2;4;21;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC-UK;Cult.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate advice-seeking patterns around the issue of supporting the learning and wellbeing of vulnerable students, among professional staff in six English secondary schools. The paper focuses on investigating variation in advice-seeking patterns among schools, exploring the association between these patterns and staff perceptions of the school climate for collaboration, and examining how these informal advice-seeking patterns relate to formal support arrangements in the schools. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach that combined findings from social network analysis with in-depth interviews was used. Findings It was found that advice-seeking patterns among staff vary substantively, even among similar schools. Furthermore, schools with more cohesive and reciprocal advice networks also showed a stronger climate for collaboration (i.e. mutual respect and distributed leadership). Also, formal organizational structures and informal advice-seeking structures showed coherence in the sample, as formally designated leaders, such as the Headteacher and the Special Educational Needs Coordinators, were generally highly central to their schools' advice network. Originality/value This study advances the field as there is little research that examines the social networks of educators in England, and no previous studies that explore teacher advice-seeking networks in relation to supporting vulnerable students, internationally.;"[Ortega, Lorena] Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Thompson, Ian; Daniels, Harry] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England";;Ortega, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;lorena.ortega@ciae.uchile.cl;Ortega, Lorena/P-1879-2018;Ortega, Lorena/0000-0002-6471-0277;"Oxford University John Fell Research Fund [EPD07450]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";This work was funded by Oxford University John Fell Research Fund EPD07450.

For this, a quasi-experimental experiment was designed, and a quantitative methodology was used through pretest and posttest in a control and experimental group in which the effectiveness of two teaching models was compared, one more traditional based on exercises written on paper and another based on interaction with a chatbot. Subsequently, the perception of the experimental group in an academic forum about the educational use of the chatbot was analyzed through text mining with tests of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), pairwise distance matrix and bigrams. The quantitative results showed that the students in the experimental group substantially improved the results compared to the students with a more traditional methodology (experimental group / mean: 32.1346 / control group / mean: 28.4706). Punctuation correctness has been improved mainly in the usage of comma, colon and periods in different syntactic patterns. Furthermore, the perception of the students in the experimental group showed that they positively value chatbots in their teaching-learning process in three dimensions: greater support and companionship in the learning process, as they perceive greater interactivity due to their conversational nature; greater feedback and interaction compared to the more traditional methodology and, lastly, they especially value the ease of use and the possibility of interacting and learning anywhere and anytime.";"[Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Mengual-Andres, Santiago] Univ Valencia, Sch Philosophy & Educ, Dept Comparat Educ & Hist Educ, Valencia, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Pablo Olavide, Fac Social Sci, Dept Educ & Social Psychol, Seville, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Atacama, IICSE, Dir Ext & Relac Int, Atacama, Chile";;"Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.";evazquez@edu.uned.es;"López-Meneses, E./G-1307-2011; Mengual-Andrés, Santiago/E-8045-2011";"López-Meneses, E./0000-0003-0741-5367; Mengual-Andrés, Santiago/0000-0002-1588-9741; Vazquez-Cano, Esteban/0000-0002-6694-7948";"I + D + I Project; FEDER (European Regional Development Fund)European Commission [RTI2018-099764-B-100]; Ministry of Science, Innovation";This research has been developed with the support of the I + D + I Project entitled: ``Gamification and ubiquitous learning in Primary Education.

International partnership has been an essential part of these strategies. Partnerships help institutions in creating practices that are costly, as well as enhancing reputation by partnering with prestigious schools. Moreover, different spectrums of partnerships require varying degrees of commitment. Noting that the motivation for and engagement in partnerships is particularly strong in business, and the region of Latin America as well as Asia and Oceania, this study attempts to depict how institutions engage internationalisation, revealed as the exchange network and dual degree network of the 20 best MBA programmes in the two regions. Employing social network analysis, we found that schools have different levels of engagement in building partnerships and the region and reputation of schools matter for partnerships. Top-ranked MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners and have a higher level of popularity in the exchange network. The dual degree network was more restricted in terms of the number, country, and prestige. Asian and Oceanian MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners but are less likely to engage in dual degree partnerships, compared to the Latin American MBA programmes. Some institutions focus their dual degree network on a particular region. As higher education institutions actively engage in various types of collaborations, the findings provide meaningful implications for understanding the patterns of international partnership among higher education institutions.;"[Kim, Jeongeun] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Sch Sci & Engn, Beauchef 850, Santiago 8370448, Chile";;Kim, J (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;;Kim, Jeongeun/N-9390-2019;"Kim, Jeongeun/0000-0002-3736-1446; Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608";;;;83;3;3;3;53;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

This article explores changes introduced by newly appointed principals placed in elementary public schools that were struggling (n = 4) and in schools that were sinking (n = 5). Findings show that all participants converged on actions to promote changes in: staffing, redesigning the organisation, and managing instruction. The quality of the actions, however, differed by type of school, highlighting the importance of defining policies for strengthening school leadership that take into account differences among schools. Induction will provide needed support at the individual level, but it might be insufficient support if other measures at the district level fail to create conditions, such as staffing, so the arrival of a new principal is indeed an opportunity to reverse a downward trajectory of an ineffective, high-poverty school.;"[Galdames, Sergio] UCL Inst Educ, Educ Leadership, London, England; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Campos, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Veronica Leiva, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; galdames, sergio/P-5604-2019";"galdames, sergio/0000-0001-6836-7595; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848; Leiva Guerrero, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-7641-0087";"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140906]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 0003]";The authors are grateful for the financial support provided, at different stages of the study, by FONDECYT Grant # 1140906 and by CONICYT FB 0003.

An Augmented Reality app to analyze digital current (DC) in resistive circuits was developed was developed to enhance students' understanding of electricity. The app allows the manipulation of circuit elements, computes the voltage and amperage values using the loop method by applying Kirchhoff's voltage law. A model with the following variables was theoretically conceived: subjective norms, technology optimism, technology innovativeness, attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use. The study considered a sample of 173 engineering students and was carried out using structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that subjective norms have a positive effect on technology optimism and technology innovativeness. Further, attitude toward using was found to depend on a medium range of students' characteristics, such as technology optimism and technology innovativeness. The results suggest that the academic environment can influence a student's beliefs concerning new technologies. Understanding how the educational environment can affect students' attitudes toward the use of new technologies can help higher education institutions establish policies for their adoption to facilitate the learning process.;"[Alvarez-Marin, Alejandro] Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Ind, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Velazquez-Iturbide, J.

The MOBAK battery is designed to assess basic motor competencies in primary education. It differentiates by the stage in the curriculum, and proposes a two-factor structure corresponding to the basic motor competencies of object movement and self-movement. This study has three objectives: to determine the construct validity of three test instruments of the MOBAK battery for assessing motor competencies; to determine how gender, BMI, and age covariates relate to motor competencies; and to examine the level of basic motor competencies of primary school children in Chile. A total of 1,785 children (45.7% girls) were assessed, divided into 1st and 2nd grade (MOBAK 1-2; 559 children; 50.6 % girls), 3rd and 4th grade (MOBAK 3-4; 496 children, 39.3 % girls), and 5th and 6th grade (MOBAK 5-6; 730 children, 46.3 % girls). The construct validity of each section was analysed using the confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA). The results confirm the two-factor structure in all sections of the MOBAK battery, they confirm the relationship between motor competencies and the covariates gender, BMI, and age, and they show that Chilean primary school children have low levels of motor competence, especially in 5th and 6th grade. The MOBAK battery is a suitable instrument for the assessment of basic motor competencies in primary education and is a diagnostic and monitoring tool for pedagogical practices and educational research.";"[Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Herrmann, Christian] Zurich Univ Teacher Educ, Zurich, Switzerland";;Carcamo-Oyarzun, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile.;"jaime.carcamo@ufrontera.cl; christian.herrmann@phzh.ch";Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime/N-2362-2015;Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime/0000-0002-7536-8788;Chile's Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) (National Commission for Scientific Research and Technology), through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (National Fund for Scientific and Technological De [11170525];This work received funding from Chile's Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) (National Commission for Scientific Research and Technology), through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development), FONDECYT project 11170525.;;45;5;5;1;9;UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR;LOGRONO;RECTORADO, AVENIDA DE LA PAZ, 137, LOGRONO, 26006, SPAIN;0034-9461;2174-0909;;REV ESP PEDAGOG;Rev.

The specialized literature has defined three predominant regulatory models: the traditional bureaucratic professional model, the quasi-market model inspired by neoliberal thought, and the evaluative state model linked to the notion of new public management. This paper seeks to contribute to this line of analysis by studying the evolution of the Chilean education system since 1980. We describe and analyze the models of regulation that have governed Chilean education and their expression in educational reforms and policies; we assert that Chile has adopted all three mentioned models. We also identify some of the principal consequences of these policies: a highly atomized, privatized, and socioeconomically segregated school system; an improvement in access to education and the conditions for the educational process; and an increase in learning outcomes, despite starting from very low levels and stalling during the past decade while remaining highly unequal in character. Thus, we propose some hypotheses to interpret those changes, relating them to the models of regulation as well as the policies previously analyzed. Overall, we affirm that the market and evaluative state models have achieved modest positive effects while producing relevant undesirable consequences. We conclude the paper with a reflection on the character of the particular hybridization of regulatory models developed in Chile, and the types of policy we believe should be prioritized to improve quality, increase innovation, and diminish inequity.";"[Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl; gonzalo.munozs@mail.udp.cl";"; Bellei, Cristian/D-9921-2015";"Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841; Bellei, Cristian/0000-0001-6963-7809";"ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Becas Chile Program";Support from ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.

These approaches have diminished teaching staff engagement with continuous curriculum improvement, without necessarily improving student outcome attainment. To illustrate mechanisms that engage and disengage teaching staff, we present a case study of a 3-year continuous improvement process implemented in a selective university in Chile. Throughout the process, 61 teaching staff members were involved in outcome assessment tasks and curriculum discussions. By triangulating three sources of evidence (97 assessment plans, 27 meeting minutes and 11 interviews), we identified engagement mechanisms that were related to staff members' motivation to improve student outcomes, and disengagement mechanisms that were related to their reticence towards misaligned and externally imposed policies. Teaching staff's perspectives on continuous improvement were discussed for further generalization of these mechanisms.;"[Hilliger, Isabel; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, Sch Engn & Sci, FCFM, Almirante Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France";;Hilliger, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;ihillige@ing.puc.cl;Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022;Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608;;;;30;0;0;2;10;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

Interviews were held with academics at both public and private well-established universities and new private universities. The analysis shows a consensus regarding the production of certain public goods such as knowledge, wider access and the promotion of a public sphere. It also reveals a dissensus such that academics at well-established universities tend to maintain a statist view of the public university in which the state plays a key role while academics at new private universities characteristically adopt an individualist view in which the university is detached from the state and more focused on securing social mobility. Drawing on an Archerian framework, it is suggested that these perceptions have been shaped by global, national and especially institutional factors.

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December).

Design/methodology/approach - Graduates of professional psychology and teaching programs from three Chilean universities responded to a questionnaire asking their perception of different aspects of their degree program and experiences in their first employment. The three universities differ significantly in the proportion of applicants admitted, and in their prestige. Findings - Salary levels are highly related to profession, but unrelated to graduates' ratings of quality of curriculum or teaching methods. Overall satisfaction with the university experience is not linked to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction, on the other hand, is highly influenced by salary and secondarily by instructional practices and perceived work relevance of the degree program. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on data from 3 of Chile's 60 universities, and graduates of two programs. Most employment in the two professions is regulated by labor agreements. Generalizability of results is limited. Graduates may not have been employed enough to demonstrate their capacities. Practical implications - The findings offer more evidence that prestige ratings are an unreliable indicator of the quality of formation offered by universities. If the government seeks to reduce income inequality, public subsidies of higher education should be based on program quality rather than on institutional prestige. Originality/value - The findings are directly relevant to the current debate in Chile about what might and what might not help to reduce severe economic inequality.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar; Gonzalez, Luis; Castillo, Dante] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, Swampscott, MA USA; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Santiago, Chile";;"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile.; Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile.";"pirata14@hotmail.com; nmcginn@igc.org; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; dcastillo@estudiospiie.cl";"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019";"McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Sandoval, Luis/0000-0001-9452-4945; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980; Castillo, Dante/0000-0002-5648-0627";Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151016];This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt) under Grant No. 1151016.;;77;2;2;1;4;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0040-0912;1758-6127;;EDUC TRAIN;Educ.

The objective of this study is to measure the effect of incorporating a variable of predisposition to mathematical tasks to a complex model, which also considers the student's formal and inductive logical reasoning skills regarding academic mathematics performance. Our aim is to assess to what extent success in mathematics provides feedback to students and how it influences overall academic achievement. In order to do so, different instruments were used, such as TOLT (Test of Logical Thinking), TILS (Test of Higher Logical Thinking) and a Likert-type scale to measure the predisposition for mathematical tasks. The interaction between variables was modeled using structural equations. The results show the important role that predisposition for mathematical tasks plays in academic performance. They also show how this predisposition interacts and modulates the effect of cognitive factors on overall academic performance, and how it also mitigates the strength of their univariate relationships. The educational role of these findings is discussed, as well as possible ways of improving a negative predisposition towards mathematical tasks in school environments.;"[Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [Romera, Eva M.; Ortega-Ruiz, Rosario; Casas, Jose A.] Univ Cordoba, San Alberto Magno S-N, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Perez, Carlos] Univ OHiggins, Cachapoal 90, Rancagua 2841158, Chile";;Cerda, G (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion 4070386, Chile.;"gamal.cerda@udec.cl; carlos.perez@uoh.cl; eva.romera@uco.es; edlorrur@uco.es; m22caboj@uco.es";"Casas, Jose A./I-8032-2017; Cerda, Gamal/Q-7398-2017; Ortega-Ruiz, Rosario/D-4268-2011; Romera, Eva M/J-7299-2016; Pérez, Carlos/R-3979-2017";"Casas, Jose A./0000-0002-0272-1835; Cerda, Gamal/0000-0002-3662-4179; Romera, Eva M/0000-0002-9414-8019; Pérez, Carlos/0000-0001-6035-7341";;;;56;17;18;3;16;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4.

After controlling the earnings differentials by observable characteristics we find that teachers are underpaid vis-a-vis other professionals and technicians in Latin America both, circa 1997 and circa 2007; and both, at their main and secondary jobs. We document a decrease in the earnings gap during the decade of analysis, mostly attributed to a general trend in gap reduction rather than as a result of teachers' improvements on their observable characteristics. The earnings gap shows important heterogeneities, across countries and along the earnings distributions. Additionally, using information from the main and secondary jobs we find that individual penalties for teachers go beyond their observable characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the mathematics education research field, arguments have been made that the conceptualization of Mathematics Identity (MI) is inconsistent and this makes the literature as a whole incoherent. This study aims to summarize how the concept has been employed and to develop an integrative model for analyzing concept-definitions and concept-operationalizations of MLI. An analysis of 69 papers revealed 3 main dimensions that characterized how identity is conceptually defined in any research literature (social/subjective, enacted/representational and change/stability) and 5 main categories that describe how the literature has implemented these dimensions operationally (identity as individual attributes; identity as narratives; identity as a relationship with specific practices; identity as ways of acting; and identities as afforded and constrained by local practices). An emphasis on representational aspects of identities, particularly during higher education, and enacted and practice-related identities during primary and secondary education research was found. The discussion shows how the field would be clarified if studies made their choices of conceptualization clear in terms of these dimensions and categories, and if research as a whole becomes more aware of restrictions/limitations in identity research, particularly at different points of the educational trajectory of students.";"[Radovic, Darinka] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Black, Laura; Williams, Julian] Univ Manchester, Sch Educ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Salas, Christian E.] Univ Diego Portales, Lab Neurociencia Cognit & Social LaNCyS, Escuela Psicol, Vergara 275, Santiago, Chile";;Radovic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.;dradovic@dim.uchile.cl;;"Williams, Julian/0000-0003-0161-0532; Black, Laura/0000-0002-3845-0459";"National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT); Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM); Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS [2807]";The work of the first author was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT) and by the Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM) and Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.;;101;23;23;9;37;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

We studied the interactions of one group of two teachers, who worked collectively in posing and solving a modeling problem through a closed group on the social network Facebook. The research question guiding this paper was how the development of mathematical modeling occurs from an Activity Theory perspective, recognizing tensions that occur, and its evolution in the process of posing and solving a modeling problem. The researchers took a qualitative approach, analyzing discursive manifestations in the modeling process. In the discussion, contradictions emerged in the group through events such as dilemma and conflict. The results indicate that the modeling task acted as an artifact that brought to light inner contradictions, and thus, allowed teachers to move from a conflict to the formulation of an open problem, and from a dilemma to the construction of a model and a pedagogic strategy.;"[Galleguillos, Jeannette] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [de Carvalho Borba, Marcelo] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil";;Galleguillos, J (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;"jeannette.galleguillos@uv.cl; mborba@rc.unesp.br";;"Galleguillos, Jeannette/0000-0003-1089-0900; Borba, Marcelo/0000-0003-3101-5486";;;;43;3;3;2;16;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

The diversity of both entities intervening in the articulation, as well their nature, make possible to identify modeling as a recurrent practice in different communities. Modeling practice allows building bridges between what is done in school and in communities outside schools. In this practice, the model doesn't exist independent of the human activity. It manifests as model while intervening in the other entity, at this moment it is called the modeled entity. Despite the interaction with the entity to be modeled is necessary, its adequacy comes about with the intervention on it, through carrying out activity with the model. It is through this intervention that the modeling act is established. Articulating different models with the phenomenon, gives rise to a modeling network that strengthen the human activity for the intervention.;"[Arrieta Vera, Jaime] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Guerrero, Mexico; [Diaz Moreno, Leonora] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Vera, JA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Guerrero, Mexico.;"jaime.arrieta@gmail.com; leonora.diaz@uv.cl";;;;;;31;1;1;0;3;CLAME-COMITE LATINOAMERICANO MAT EDUC;SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO;OFFICE 101 AV INST POLITECNICO NACIONAL 2508, SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO, CP 07360, MEXICO;1665-2436;2007-6819;;REV LAT AM INV MAT E;Rev.

One of the stated objectives of the new policy was to increase the access of secondary school graduates from families with lower levels of education. To answer that concern, we analyzed administrative data from more than 800,000 students seeking university admission in 2012, 2015, and 2019. Our objective was to determine whether an increased proportion of first-generation students had been admitted to selective universities. The results show that between 2015 and 2019, the impact of the gratuity on first-generation admissions was marginal. It was of some importance only for those secondary school graduates from public schools and those who had been enrolled in the technical-professional track. The enrollment rate of these groups increased 2.2 and 2.7%, respectively. In sum, the effect of the introduction of gratuity on enrollment of first-generation students was not as impressive as expected. It has acted principally as an alternative source of finance, reducing use of other forms such as bank loans and scholarships. These results challenge directly the hypothesis that inequity in access to university is primarily attributable to financial difficulties.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ PIIE, Ricardo Matte Perez 0510, Santiago, Chile; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, San Ignacio Loyola 160, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, 38 Sheridan Rd, Swampscott, MA 01907 USA; [Corradi, Bruno] Univ Tarapaca, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile";;Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.;"oespinoza@academia.cl; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; nmcginn@igc.org; bruno-corradi@hotmail.com";"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019";"Corradi, Bruno/0000-0002-4217-0900; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980";National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT [1200343];This research was supported by the National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT Project No1200343.

In the present study, academics in two public universities are seen to hold strong views in favour of public universities playing public roles and they identify several public goods that they value. These academics also hold ambivalent perceptions of the relationships between the state and the market. On the one hand, the market and the state's role in it are accorded a limited legitimacy. On the other hand, it is felt that the state does not sufficiently enable its public universities to realise their potential. The paper proceeds to argue that in this ambivalence can be detected four juxtapositions. It is suggested that these juxtapositions together open a space for a new settlement between the state and its public universities such that Chilean public universities might more fully realise their public possibilities.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Zavala, Ricardo; Morales, Karimme] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile [AYV028/01-19]; Economic and Social Research Council [Centre for Global Higher Education] [ES/M010082/1]";Support from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and the Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile, codigo proyecto AYV028/01-19 are gratefully acknowledged.

The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which Chilean university graduates' satisfaction with their professional training is associated with experiences during the degree program they pursued, employment experiences including salary level, or the prestige level or image of the university they attended. Survey questionnaires were used to collect data from recent graduates of professional programs in Primary-Secondary Teaching and Psychology in three universities that differ in prestige.

To this aim, the results of a multiple case study are presented which prove that when teachers are faced with the task of evaluating processes of instruction, they employ-either implicitly or explicitly-the OSA criteria of didactical suitability (epistemic, cognitive, affective, mediational, interactional and ecological). Therefore, the explicit application of said criteria in teachers' education cycles contributes to the development of the didactic analysis competence that is necessary for teachers to be able to reflect on their own practices.;"[Breda, Adriana; Roberto Pino-Fan, Luis] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile; [Font, Vicenc] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain";;Pino-Fan, LR (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Exact Sci, C Lord Cochrane 1039, Osorno, Chile.;luis.pino@ulagos.cl;"Breda, Adriana/D-7124-2017; Pino-Fan, Luis R./Q-5687-2019; Breda, Adriana/X-5445-2019; Font, Vicenç/H-1598-2015";"Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Pino-Fan, Luis R./0000-0003-4060-7408; Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Font, Vicenç/0000-0003-1405-0458";"MINECO/FEDER, UE [EDU2015-64646-P]; ICE-UB [REDICE16-1520]; FONDECYT (CONICYT-Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150014]; PDSE program CAPES/Brazil [99999.004658/2014-00]";This work has been developed as part of the Research Projects on teacher training EDU2015-64646-P (MINECO/FEDER, UE), REDICE16-1520 (ICE-UB), FONDECYT No 11150014 (CONICYT-Chile), and the PDSE program CAPES/Brazil process number 99999.004658/2014-00.;;56;33;43;1;11;MODESTUM LTD;LONDON;STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND;1305-8215;1305-8223;;EURASIA J MATH SCI T;Eurasia J.

For this purpose, we analyzed the activity performed by five high school teachers, in relation to an activity about patterns suggested in the framework of the Master of Mathematics Education Program at University of Los Lagos, Chile.

Through a qualitative approach in which 20 interviews and two focus groups were conducted, this study focuses on a public university in Chile and examines ways in which academics experience time. The results reveal a felt expansion and contraction of time and timeframes to which academics accord different levels of investment. A patterning of narratives of time can be glimpsed in which academics are trading slots of time: they surrender part of their time to service institutional demands in return for time spaces in which they can pursue their own academic interests. Accordingly, the concept of time-markets may be helpful in understanding the evolution of higher education systems in neoliberal environments more generally.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Ave Brasil 2140, Valparaiso, Chile.;carolina.guzman@uv.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;;;;33;29;33;0;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

Findings from a thematic analysis of 68 publications show that attention to prospective principals increased after the year 2000 and this was driven by four main concerns: underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities, principal supply and demand, the principalship as a school improvement lever, and the expansion of leadership posts in schools. Selected articles addressed three dimensions of the pathways before a person is first appointed to this post: (a) micro (individual's agency), (b) meso (preparation of prospective principals), and (c) macro (policies shaping access to the post). Across time and countries, pathways to the principalship are resourced by individuals' professional orientations and by contextual factors, formal pre-service preparation may be desirable but not always available or required, and policies frame a conceptualisation of the principalship that shapes the two previous dimensions. The internationalization of research on pathways to the principalship has brought to the forefront normative assumptions that should be critically challenged when considering how to recruit, develop, and support prospective school principals.;"[Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Educ Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flessa, Joseph] Univ Toronto, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl;;;" [FB 003];  [1210762]";The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the ANID (grant number FB 003, Grant #1210762).;;126;0;0;0;0;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

This study focuses on the contribution of school placement, controlling by motor functionality and receptive vocabulary, over several domains of participation. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 123 preadolescents and adolescents with CP, from both special and regular school systems of Chile. A quantitative approach was employed using standardised instruments (i.e. Life habits questionnaire, Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised, and Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised). Results suggest that preadolescents' participation is significantly predicted by motor functionality and receptive language in all domains of participation, but for interpersonal relationship and community. For adolescents, school placement explained a significant amount of the variance for mobility, responsibility, and community participation, besides the variability explained by motor functionality and receptive language. Attending special schools exerts a negative influence on some participation domains, including mobility, responsibility, community life and recreation. Our findings support the importance of considering inclusive educational programmes as a critical aspect to improve wellbeing of people with CP, while also furthering their rights of participation.;"[Perez-Salas, Claudia Paz] Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Barrio Univ S-N,2 Piso, Concepcion, Chile; [Ortega, Alonso] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Escuela Fonoaudiol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Ortega, Alonso] Univ Valparaiso, CIDCL, Valparaiso, Chile; [Parra, Victoria] Univ Catolica Temuco, Dept Infancia & Educ Basica, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile; [Rosenbaum, Peter] McMaster Univ, CanChild Ctr Childhood Disabil Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada";;Perez-Salas, CP (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Barrio Univ S-N,2 Piso, Concepcion, Chile.;cperezs@udec.cl;Rosenbaum, Peter/AAW-7913-2021;"Rosenbaum, Peter/0000-0001-6751-5613; Ortega, Alonso/0000-0001-8671-2735; Parra, Victoria/0000-0001-8870-2629";National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT), Proyecto Fondecyt [11110358];This research was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT), Proyecto Fondecyt 11110358.;;44;0;0;2;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

Based on a cluster-randomized sampling process, 2,468 students distributed in 12 schools and 69 classrooms participated in the study. Schools were randomly assigned to the computer-based instruction (CBI) group or traditional instruction (TI) group. Teachers assigned to the CBI treatment integrated the applications into the language arts curriculum during one school semester. A standardized test was used to measure reading comprehension and writing. The data were analyzed through a statistical multilevel model. The findings showed that students in the CBI group improved their reading and writing skills significantly more than students under TI-yielding an effect size d = 0.30.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Management & Econ, Santiago 3363, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago 3363, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Management & Econ, Av LB OHiggins, Santiago 3363, Chile.;"hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; mario.lopez@usach.cl";Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";;;;58;13;13;0;51;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1042-1629;1556-6501;;ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES;ETR&D-Educ.

Examples of these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion, individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion of CiC. The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage of both this system and standard software are compared and research results are presented.

The study advances the hypothesis that emotional competences and classroom climate are mediators in school achievement. For this purpose, 420 students from secondary and further education were selected with an average age of 14.29 +/- 1.52. In emotional competence, the results showed differences according to gender and educational level, while in classroom climate, differences were only found according to educational level. The mediational analysis showed that classroom climate is an influential variable in the predictive value of emotional competence in relation to school achievement. Likewise, emotional competence acts as a mediating influence on classroom climate and school achievement. This study thus highlights the need to implement training processes to help teachers to promote positive socio-emotional contexts and programmes to develop students' emotional competence, which will improve their school achievement.;"[Lopez-Gonzalez, Luis] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Oriol, Xavier] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Lopez-Gonzalez, L (corresponding author), Av Bellamar 12-14,Bloque C,Escalera 1,1-1a, Barcelona, Spain.;luislopez@programatreva.com;Granado, Xavier Oriol/AAO-3112-2021;Granado, Xavier Oriol/0000-0001-7130-7729;;;;82;24;25;25;165;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC;Cult.

We see an emergent opportunity to contribute to the current discussion on transdisciplinarity and its institutionalization at universities. Our specific interest in this paper is to disentangle the conditions under which transdisciplinarity is developed in Latin American contexts and how it can be better implemented within those contexts. Our study focuses on the context of Latin American Public Universities. We examine the following research questions: (i) How is transdisciplinarity conceptualized in university policy and what are the conditions for its institutionalization? (ii) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006-2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of situated transdisciplinarity that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes.

In the last few years, the University of Santiago de Chile has implemented a program of English Blended Learning in arcareers of eight faculties, whose objective is to develop linguistic and communicative skills at an intermediate level. For this purpose, the program consists of three pedagogical components: classrooms lessons, tutoring and an on-line platform. At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, a process evaluation was carried out that sought to know, from the perspective of those immediately involved, how the program had been implemented, emphasizing the progress towards the fulfillment of its objectives. The data collection considered three techniques: a survey about the learning experience of the students (N = 780), a focus group with the teachers of the program and semi-structured interviews with coordinators or heads of the University. The main findings show a positive evaluation of the program when each component is observed by itself. However, the analysis of the integration between these reveals four critical tensions related to: the guidance on autonomous work, the managing of the assignment of tutorials, the transition from the pedagogical contents of the platform to the class and the functional differentiation between the components of the program.;"[Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Univ Santiago Chile, Polit Equidad & Programas Inclus Educ Super, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Linguist & Literatura, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Univ Santiago Chile, Area Evaluat VRA, Santiago, Chile; [Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Perpetua Freire 821, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Pica 1031, Santiago, Chile";;"Lenta, RM (corresponding author), Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France.; Lenta, RM (corresponding author), 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France.";"rodolfo.martinic@gmail.com; sergio.urzua@usach.cl; ricardo.ubeda@usach.cl; roxana.aranda@usach.cl";;;;;;31;0;0;5;9;ASOC IBEROAMERICANA EDUCACION SUPERIOR DISTANCIA;MADRID;UNED, FAC EDUC, C/ JUAN DEL ROSAI, 14, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1138-2783;1390-3306;;RIED-REV IBEROAM EDU;RIED-Rev.

It firstly offers an overview of the considerable empirical literature around teaching-especially conceptions of teaching, approaches to teaching and teaching practices-and goes on to pose some philosophical and social theoretical considerations that open further the territory around teaching in university. Against this background, we propose the concept of 'horizons of teaching'. Horizons of teaching provide a context in which it makes sense for teachers to give themselves to the teaching enterprise and to go on giving themselves to teaching. Horizons include diverse and intricate layers at both micro- and macro-levels that interact in a permanent and dynamic way; they involve persons and collectivities; and they concern structures and agency. The paper concludes by proposing that horizons of teaching configure and delineate curricula and the pedagogical relationship in a way that might contain a revolutionary potentiality in recasting teaching in higher education.";"[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.;"r.barnett@ioe.ac.uk; carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]";We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

The results indicate that being a bully or a bully-victim increases the probability of being a low performing student. For the case of victims, our results suggest a heterogeneity according students' ability, decreasing academic achievement for students with below average ability, but increasing it for very high achieving students. We also found that students claiming to belong to a subculture characterized by a defiant attitude towards authority have lower academic achievement. Our results support anti-bullying policies and those attempting to promote student's identities associated with higher academic achievement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, neither of these perspectives gives much consideration to the teaching framework in which the computer is actually used. In order to address this issue, a case study was designed to explore teachers' concepts and beliefs about computers. In this case study two teachers were involved in a software development process, and observation of their discussions during this process was used as a technique to uncover the teachers' beliefs about using computers. The case study led to a model of how teachers use computers in classroom teaching. This model conceptualizes the computer as a teaching resource that helps teachers to develop their teaching strategy, replacing the teachers in their role of managing students' rehearsal of materials and serving as a classroom management tool. This model of using computers demonstrates significant links between teachers' teaching strategies and the use of computers in education and thereby provides a support for a view of computers as professional tools for educators.;"Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, London WC1H 0AL, England; Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile";;Mellar, H (corresponding author), Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.;;"Hinostroza, J.

Drawing on Freidson's work on professionalism in the field of sociology of professions, our typology highlights four models of regulation - the 'market', the 'rules', the 'training', and the 'professional skills' models. We discuss how these models, embedded in a bureaucratic, market-oriented or professional approach, shape the regulation of the teaching profession and teachers' work in different contexts.

This study analysed the explanations provided by student teachers in STEM areas from a socio-materiality perspective focused on verbal and nonverbal language and representations. The study was conducted in a hybrid research format by scholars and a preservice teacher. First, the study compared the representational elements used by 86 student teachers to construct explanations about various concepts in a roleplay setting. Next, a positioning analysis was done by a preservice teacher, to a selection of five of these explanations focused on the concept of force. The positioning analysis highlighted the embedded voices in the construction of explanations, with a focus on the intersection between science and language. The results showed that the student teachers created explanations as static artefacts, mainly using examples, graphs and images to clarify the concepts. The voices of learners and scientists were mostly absent from the explanations, which led to the presentation of explanations in STEM areas as finished and unquestionable artefacts, with references neither to nature nor to the history of science. We reflect on the meanings attributed to learning to be a practitioner in the context of interconnecting science and language through explanations, as a process of meaning (re)production within the classroom. Implications for teacher education are discussed in order to enhance student teachers' awareness about constructing knowledge by enacting explanations in the science classroom.;"[Cabello, Valeria M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Real, Constanza] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile; [Impedovo, Maria Antonietta] Aix Marseille Univ, ADEF, Marseille, France";;Cabello, VM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"vmcabello@uc.cl; constanza.real@ug.uchile.cl; maria-antonietta.IMPEDOVO@univ-amu.fr";"Cabello, Valeria M./AAA-1012-2019; impedovo, maria/L-6471-2016";"Cabello, Valeria M./0000-0001-6190-9187; impedovo, maria/0000-0003-2172-7105";"CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional [REDES180109]; Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion";This work was financially supported by CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional REDES180109, Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion.;;67;0;0;1;27;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0157-244X;1573-1898;;RES SCI EDUC;Res.

In three different experiments involving fourth, sixth, and eighth graders, respectively; students answered reading comprehension questions presented in conventional (i.e., paper-based design) or drag-and-drop formats. The tests consisted of four-sentence ordering items in Experiment 1, four graphic organizer items in Experiment 2, and two cloze tests and two graphic organizer items in Experiment 3. The conventional and drag & drop groups were compared on test performance (i.e., accuracy) and efficiency (i.e., response time and number of mouse clicks).

Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to the social class background of university faculty and how it might affect their pathways to the professoriate and their opportunities to access high-paying positions. We attempted to address this gap in the literature by looking at a sample of faculty working at Chilean universities. We used a path analysis approach to estimate not only the direct effects of social class of origin on income but also the indirect mechanisms through which social class of origin influences faculty income. We posed two alternative conceptual perspectives with regard to the effects of social class on income-social reproduction and human capital. We found that faculty who come from the upper social class have access to higher-quality undergraduate education and to more prestigious PhD-granting universities and they report higher earnings as compared with those who come from a low social class. These findings resemble a dynamic of cumulative educational advantages that provides grounds to the theory of social reproduction. Although it could be argued that the positive effect of prestige of the PhD-granting university on income is in line with the human capital theory, we claim that such effect cannot be analyzed independently from the direct and indirect relationships that exist between social class of origin and the prestige of the university from which faculty obtained their doctorate degrees.;"[Chiappa, Roxana] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Miller Hall,2012 Skagit Ln, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Perez Mejias, Paulina] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Mejias, PP (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"rchiappa@uw.edu; paulina.perez@ciae.uchile.cl";"Mejias, Paulina Perez/AAV-3206-2021; Perez Mejias, Paulina/O-7600-2017";"Chiappa Baros, Roxana/0000-0002-3523-1197; Perez Mejias, Paulina/0000-0002-8024-4843";;;;85;2;2;0;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

However, there are students who, despite living in impoverished conditions, achieve solid academic performance. How they do so is a question of central importance. The present study uses the concept of resilience as a theoretical framework that can help us to answer it. It investigates various characteristics common to the students, families, and schools of Chile, and places emphasis on understanding resilience as it relates to the academic achievement of students with low SES. Multilevel models and comparisons reveal performance determinants associated with resilience, such as reading engagement and schooling conditions. This study highlights resilience as a framework for addressing the obstacles that face disadvantaged youth in developing educational systems.;"[Vera, Gabriela Gomez; Vlenzuela, Juan Pablo; Sotomayor, Carmen] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Vera, Gabriela Gomez] Univ Bourgogne, F-21004 Dijon, France; [Vlenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Fac Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Sotomayor, Carmen] Univ Chile, Fac Philosophy & Humanities, Santiago, Chile";;Vera, GG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile.;"gabriela.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl; jpvalenzuela@ciae.uchile.cl; csotomayor@ciae.uchile.cl";, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez Vera, Gabriela/0000-0002-6842-3953;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy [79112008]; University of Chile";The authors would like to thank CER editors and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript.

Here we identify three large descriptive frameworks for critical thinking: that of argumentative logic, the axiological framework and the cognitive perspective. All these contributions, as well as the complex bundle of theoretical lines and concepts in which this construct is inscribed, are analyzed from the point of view of theory of education. Based on this, we then discuss how to orient pedagogical action towards training in critical thinking. We conclude by identifying the traits of a critical thinker as an actor who constructs and registers the potentialities of cognition and relates them to praxis, that is, with a reflexive action oriented towards decision-making.;"[Martin Garcia, Antonio Victor] Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Bradasic, Oscar Barrientos] Univ Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile";;Garcia, AVM (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, Paseo Canalejas 169, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.;"avmg@usal.es; obradasic@hotmail.com";Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/L-4931-2014;Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/0000-0002-0216-2754;;;;52;0;0;0;5;EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA;SALAMANCA;APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN;1130-3743;2386-5660;;TEOR EDUC;Teor.

The reform calls for de-municipalization of the public school sector (345 municipal education departments under mayoral control) and the creation of 70 Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica (SLEPs) between 2018 and 2025. The reform represents a largescale attempt to improve and save public education in Chile. This analysis is based on case studies of implementation of the first four SLEPs in the first year of the reform. Using Stake's method for multiple case study analysis, the analysis explores how context influences the professional capacity of the SLEPs to provide professional assistance to schools. The study relates to research on the effectiveness of intermediate level agencies in school systems and on contextual influences on organizational innovation and capacity building. The analysis reveals that contextual factors shaping initial professional capacity of the SLEPs reinforced traditional practices of local education agency support to schools in three of the four cases. The differentiating factor centered on the actions of local agency leaders who responded to capacity gaps and lack of direction from government authorities as either constraints on change or as an opportunity for innovation.;"[Anderson, Stephen] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Anderson, Stephen] OISE Comparat Int & Dev Educ Program & Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Uribe, Mario] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Educ Leaders, Valparaiso, Chile; [Uribe, Mario] Fdn Chile, Sch Management & Leadership Program, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile";;Anderson, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.;steve.anderson@utoronto.ca;;;ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence;The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research funding in Chile from ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence.;;40;2;2;6;16;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

We observed the teaching of SMIs and preservice teachers (PSTs) with observation rubrics to gauge the fidelity to which they implemented practices. Across programs, SMIs provided opportunities for PSTs to experience the instructional practices as intended, although there was less opportunity for pedagogical development around them. The strongest evidence of PST fidelity to the intervention was found for two practices: Increasing student interaction and Facilitating student talk. Considerable variation was found across the programs for other practices including some evidence of negative effects.

Students in a classroom are given a passage on their computer screen and asked to highlight the words they do not understand. This information is summarized on the instructors screen by highlighting in red the words most highlighted, in orange the second most highlighted, and in yellow the third most highlighted, with a superscript showing the number of students who selected each word.

Influential comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved in these kinds of imposed-etic approaches, such as (1) universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the components' significances, (3) the congruence between languages and conceptions, and (4) the components' coverage of the phenomena. Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We investigate the premise of universality within the examined components by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is simply unjustifiable. We also thoroughly examined the three other premises underpinning the Western-based imposed-etic perspective.;"[Tuohilampi, Laura; Hannula, Markku S.; Laine, Anu; Naveri, Liisa; Salo i Nevado, Laia] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Varas, Leonor; Giaconi, Valentina] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Tuohilampi, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;laura.tuohilampi@helsinki.fi;"Hannula, Markku/AAF-6362-2020; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Nevado, Laia Saló i/AAR-7668-2021; Laine, Anu/AAE-7083-2020";"Laine, Anu/0000-0003-3881-8134; Salo i Nevado, Laia/0000-0002-2773-1167";"bi-national Chile-Finland cooperation project in CONICYT Chile [AKA09]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [1135556]; Basal Project Center for Mathematical Modeling, at the University of Chile; Project Center for Advanced Research in Education, at the University of Chile [CIE05]";"This research was partially supported by a bi-national Chile-Finland cooperation project: AKA09 in CONICYT Chile; #1135556 in the Academy of Finland.

For this reason, it seems interesting to review other elements that do not belong to structural factors and that can be addressed by the educational community to support students who live in that reality. There is great evidence of the incidence of variables such as attributive styles, self-regulation strategies, school coexistence and academic self-concept regarding school performance, but a specific and joint analysis of these variables for vulnerable realities could provide clues to educational communities in order to prioritize and implement improvement opportunities. The objective of this work was to examine the joint effect of the aforementioned factors with respect to the academic achievement of middle third and fourth year students from vulnerable Chilean schools. The study involved secondary school students from highly socially vulnerable contexts (N=1498). Four Likert scale surveys were used for data collection, which were applied massively and online. Through the Structural Equations Model, results show that academic self-concept obtained the highest statistical significance (beta=.22; p<.05), followed by self-regulation strategies (beta=.12; p<.05). It was also observed that the indiscipline factor obtained a significant but inverse association (beta=-.22; p<.05) with the grades of the general average of the students. The correlations between the variables were also significant, showing that school performance would have a stronger and positive correlation with self-regulation strategies and academic self-concept. The conclusions focus on the anticipation and prevention of situations of indiscipline, the promotion of a positive academic self-concept and the implementation of specific programs that contribute to improvement in self-regulation strategies; considered as practices or actions located within the scope of action of the educational community.";"[Vera Sagredo, Angelica] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Cerda Etchepare, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Aragon Mendizabal, Estibaliz] Univ Cadiz, Dept Psicol, Cadiz, Spain; [Perez Wilson, Carlos] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Rancagua, Chile";;Sagredo, AV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.;"avera@ucsc.cl; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; estivaliz.aragon@uca.es; carlos.perez@uoh.cl";;;;;;68;0;0;1;1;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Because learning progressions lay out how students' ideas change over a long period of time, learning progressions could help teachers build better understanding of student thinking, appropriate learning goals, and instructional moves for supporting students in developing more sophisticated ideas. In this study, we explored the potential of learning progression-based curriculum materials to support teachers in developing more sophisticated content knowledge (CK) and pedagocial content knowledge (PCK) for teaching about water in environmental systems. Teachers participated in professional development that introduced them to a learning progression for water in environmental systems and curriculum materials based on this learning progression. Teachers completed written assessments of their CK and PCK prior to the workshops and a year later. Analyses showed that teachers who taught lessons using the learning progression-based curriculum materials showed modest increases in CK, knowledge of learning goals, and knowledge of student thinking. These increases were greater than analogous changes evident for teachers who did not use the curriculum materials. However, even among those who implemented the curriculum materials, teachers' post-assessment performance did not yet reflect knowledge for supporting students in developing model-based reasoning about water. These results show that learning progressions have potential for supporting teacher learning, but that the ubiquity of traditional school science discourse may limit their potential for both student and teacher progress toward model-based reasoning.;"[Gunckel, Kristin L.; Salinas, Ivan] Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Covitt, Beth A.] Univ Montana, SpectrUM Discovery Area, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Salinas, Ivan] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Santiago, Chile";;Gunckel, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;kgunckel@email.arizona.edu;Barrios, Ivan Salinas/I-7485-2018;Barrios, Ivan Salinas/0000-0002-5675-3920;National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1020176, DUE-0832173];National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: DRL-1020176 and DUE-0832173;;62;11;11;7;51;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-4308;1098-2736;;J RES SCI TEACH;J.

Findings indicate that the association between the school's aggregate family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores is much greater in the private-voucher sector than in the public one, resulting in marked socioeconomic stratification of test scores in the Chilean voucher system. We also find that the amount of tuition fees paid by parents in private-voucher schools has no bearing on test scores, after controlling for the socioeconomic makeup of the school. Implications of these findings for educational inequality in the context of a universal voucher system are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in education, there is extensive evidence about the negative effects of predominant accountability systems, which call their expected positive impacts into question. Some of the detrimental effects of these systems involve unequal distribution of knowledge as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of vulnerable students, minorities and powerless groups, and of the schools that serve them. This evidence, along with emerging demands for social justice in terms of participation and recognition, highlights the need to analyse the shortcomings of current accountability systems in connection to ideals of social justice in education.

Some responses produce real, broad increases in learning, but other responses can raise reported test scores without increasing learning. We estimate the effect of an accountability program on reading scores and math scores in Chile. Over a 6-year period, fourth-grade reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, on average, and half the rise was due to the accountability program. However, many schools, especially schools serving disadvantaged students, inflated their accountability ratings by having low-performing students miss high-stakes tests. To encourage healthier responses to accountability, we recommend setting accountability goals that are attainable for schools with disadvantaged students, and providing incentives for all students to take high-stakes tests.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile.;"alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com; paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com";;;;;;37;1;1;0;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1874-8597;1874-8600;;EDUC ASSESS EVAL ACC;Educ.

Yet graduation and persistence rates remain low. One way to improve graduation and persistence is to use data and analytics to identify students at risk of dropout, target interventions, and evaluate interventions' effectiveness at improving student success. We illustrate the potential of this approach using data from eight Chilean universities. Results show that data available at matriculation are only weakly predictive of persistence, while prediction improves dramatically once data on university grades become available. Some predictors of persistence are under policy control. Financial aid predicts higher persistence, and being denied a first-choice major predicts lower persistence. Student success programmes are ineffective at some universities; they are more effective at others, but when effective they often fail to target the highest risk students. Universities should use data regularly and systematically to identify high-risk students, target them with interventions, and evaluate those interventions' effectiveness.";"[Von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile.;alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com;;;Universidad de La Frontera;This work was supported by the Universidad de La Frontera [Apoyo Pasantias En El Extranjero Para Investigadores/As Ufro].;;34;7;7;5;12;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-080X;1469-9508;;J HIGH EDUC POLICY M;J.

Concerned about first year failures among first-generation students, a university in Chile devised a between-semesters course intended to allow failed students to remain with their entering class. The course had three major elements: compression of a semester's course work into 2 weeks; use of incentives to motivate students to prepare for classes; and flipped class participation. In 2014, this intensive course was offered in the break between the first and second semesters. Some 310 students in Health Sciences who had failed at least one of three required courses were invited to enroll; 140 signed up. At the end of the course, more than 90% of the students taking the intensive course passed the regular final examination they had previously failed and continued with their entering class. With no additional intervention, over the next seven semesters, students who had taken the intensive course performed as well in their courses as those who had not and were less likely to drop out.

However, these reforms are tied to two different realities that conflict with each other: a formative reality, which promotes a school climate of local decision-making and the improvement of school performance; and a punitive reality, which prioritizes improvement in the school climate through accountability protocols and regulations. We used Actor-Network Theory to describe the network of actors that underlie these realities. We analyzed key documents and conducted active interviews with actors responsible for the design and implementation of these policies. Results show that the assembled network enacts an accountability reality by means of the Law on Assurance of the Quality of Education, with key devices and s-objects performing the network. However, this enacted reality is at odds with a logic of school improvement that is still defended by the Ministry of Education, an actor that is no longer the main source of translation in the network.

The results highlight diversity in how these girls experienced mathematics: They valued different forms of doing mathematics (independent and collaborative; wider and complex; and straightforward, procedure-oriented mathematics), showed different forms of engagement (detachment, protagonist and challenging, and compliant and support-seeker), and narrated different MIs (efficient, different, and responsible).

Multilevel-growth models were used to analyse the trajectories, and linear adjustment with propensity score matching was used to control for confounding variables. We found positive effects of voucher education on intercepts which, after controlling for schools' socioeconomic composition and selection policies, became irrelevant in terms of effect sizes. Regarding slopes, voucher schools have a significant positive effect, which is irrelevant in terms of effect sizes if 1 year is considered, but relevant for a 12-year school trajectory.

The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics - using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity - to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom.

In this article we present an approach to this problem from the classroom practice, describing and analysing some aspects of the content and nature of the knowledge of two primary school teachers when working on the measurement of time with their students. We have adopted a qualitative methodology, and three moments of the teachers' interventions have been considered as a reflective action research cycle: for practice, in practice and on practice. To this end, planning and intervention sessions have been recorded for two primary school teachers and their actions have been interpreted in consideration of the analytical model Mathematics Teachers' Specialised Knowledge (MTSK). This analysis has revealed that teachers are aware of the complexity of dealing with the reading and recording of time when they plan their intervention, and therefore they recognize the need to teach how to use the clock. Our first findings point out the need to provide the students with references for the units of time and to emphasize the functioning of the measuring instrument, questioning the usefulness of the analogue clock.;"[Pizarro, Noetni] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Miguel Belmonte, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Fac Educ, Ctr Formac Profesorado, Rector Royo Villanova S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala de Henares, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala, Dept Fis & Matemat, Campus Univ, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain";;Pizarro, N (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile.;"noemi.pizarro@umce.c1; belmonte@ucm.es; blanca.arteaga@uah.es";Arteaga-Martínez, Blanca/G-4802-2016;Arteaga-Martínez, Blanca/0000-0002-1079-1526;;;;35;0;0;1;10;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Scientific texts are conceptually and linguistically complex, especially for students from low-income contexts because they have neither the experience with the language nor the literacy skills to face the challenges of scientific knowledge. This study used a mix method approach to compare the cognitive scaffolding practiced by teachers during science reading activities in high- and low-performing schools. Three teachers and 141 fourth grade students from low socioeconomic background schools participated in 48 class sessions. Classes were video-recorded and transcribed. The data were analyzed using Sanchez' Pedagogic Practice Analysis System. The results show that teachers from both types of schools continuously use reading as a tool for learning. The effective teacher uses reading with non-invasive scaffolding and varied verbal participation to elaborate knowledge, promoting literal and inferential comprehension and more opportunities for the students to construct knowledge. By contrast, less effective teachers use reading with invasive scaffolding and little verbal participation of the students to consolidate knowledge, promoting mainly literal comprehension.

Recovery schools can offer different kinds of activities in order to engage their students; are some activities more effective than others? Is their effect moderated by the type of dropouts who participate? Chile recently opened a national programme of Second Opportunity Schools (Escuelas de Segunda Oportunidad). Their mission is to provide primary and high school dropouts between 14 and 18 years of age an opportunity to complete their studies. Latent Class analysis, based on conventional demographic and current activity data, was used to classify these students into four distinct groups. The groups varied in their level of satisfaction (or engagement) with the Second Opportunity School in which they were studying. Within each School, the groups' satisfaction varied according to the activities in which students participated. That is, variation in satisfaction was more a result of student characteristics than differences between Schools. Some activities were more effective than others in engaging or satisfying some types of students.

More than 30 international organizations for cooperation currently operating in Latin America and the Caribbean were identified. Two groups of institutions with more than 60% similitude were established by the Bray-Curtis index, according to the countries of origin of member universities. Multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that variables measuring levels of affiliation are more effective in accounting for integration into a given group than those variables associated with coverage or past experience. These organizations show highly redundant and territorial concentration. The most recurrent management problems, evaluated by analyzing the content of documents and interviews, are related to: budgets, information and university culture.

In each of both countries, over two thousand teachers of all school levels and types were surveyed during a two-month period on their professional experiences in the first year of remote teaching. The article discusses teacher accounts of how their work changed, their difficulties, impact on well-being, as well as new professional learning brought about by the challenges involved. Conceptually, the study relied on notions of occupational professionalism, self-efficacy perceptionsand collegial support in challenging circumstances. Results in both countries highlighted an impact on teacher occupational professionalism and self-efficacy perceptions, mainly brought about by intermittent levels of engagement of students during remote teaching sessions, and difficulties in carrying out proper assessments of student learning. Student well-being was of greater concern to teachers than their own problems, despite feeling the stressful effect of much longer daily working hours, more so among Chilean than Portuguese teachers. The study also brought out teachers' imaginative efforts and the use of unaccustomed pedagogic strategies to reach out to students and insure some level of learning, especially among those without internet connectivity.;"[Avalos, Beatrice; Araneda, Sebastian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Maria Assuncao] Univ Minho, Inst Educ, Res Ctr Child Studies, Braga, Portugal";;Avalos, B (corresponding author), Alsacia 150,Dept 33 Las Condes, Santiago 7550073, Chile.;bavalos254@gmail.com;;;"PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/00317/2020, UIDP700317/2020]";"This work was supported by the PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB003 [Project FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [Project UIDB/00317/2020 and UIDP700317/2020].";;36;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1354-0602;1470-1278;;TEACH TEACH;Teach.

When the bottom reservoir is heated, the system may experience periodic eruptions of hot water and steam at the top similarly to the geyser effect occurring in nature. The eruption frequency of a toy geyser is inspected experimentally as a function of the heating power and the height of the setup. We propose a thermodynamic model of this system that predicts the time between eruptions. A phase diagram that takes into account the thermal energy provided to the geyser and the geometry was constructed for the toy geyser. The conditions to obtain the geyser effect have been determined. The study of the toy geyser is then extended to the case of two reservoirs connected to the same tube. Such a coupled system adopts a complex time evolution that reflects the dynamics of natural geysers.

To determine whether these changes would benefit future biologists, we investigated mathematics use in research biology. We surveyed prominent journals in high and low math-use areas for articles referencing the use of quantitative methods. In addition, we conducted a large-scale survey of research biologists within these fields about their use of, and training in, mathematics and statistics. We then performed follow-up interviews with a purposeful sample of respondents. Our results indicate that biologists need a base in descriptive and inferential statistics and mathematical modeling, including some concepts from calculus, focused on conceptual understanding rather than computational accuracy, followed by differentiated programs of study in mathematics and statistics, depending on intended discipline within biology. Comparison of our findings with the recommended requirements from major stakeholder groups indicates some alignment but also some discrepancies.

A novel experimental economics approach based on a computational Web platform of an electricity market is proposed here for the practical teaching of electrical engineering students. The approach is designed to diminish the gap that exists between theory and practice in this field, through a methodological strategy for teaching/learning called simulation. In the proposed simulation exercise, groups of students operate as market agents and have the freedom to create their own strategies. Additionally, a theoretical model and a specific simulation tool are used for the evaluation of the proposed strategies. The test system is based on the market structure of the Chilean wholesale electricity market and was tested on student groups at two universities. Based on the students' performance, the strategic behavior of agents and their impact on market price evolution are described and analyzed. Student assessment supports the conclusion that the proposed experimental economics framework offers a useful mechanism in student practical work for understanding and explaining the observed phenomena.;"[Guevara-Cedeno, Jessica Y.] Technol Univ Panama, Dept Elect Engn, Panama City 081907289, Panama; [Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo; Uribe, Rosa] Univ Chile, Fac Math & Phys Sci, Ctr Energy, Sch Engn,CMM,ISCI,DIE, Santiago 4123, Chile";;Guevara-Cedeno, JY (corresponding author), Technol Univ Panama, Dept Elect Engn, Panama City 081907289, Panama.;"jessica.guevara@utp.ac.pa; rodpalma@cec.uchile.cl";Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo E./A-1849-2012;"Palma-Behnke, Rodrigo E./0000-0002-7508-0944; Guevara Cedeno, Jessica Yarelys/0000-0002-7273-6848";"FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1080668]; IFARHU-SENACYT, Panama";"Manuscript received December 06, 2011; accepted February 23, 2012.

Background: University education is committed to change and adaptation to the current and new realities of the world. The framework for measuring the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) outcomes and Conceive- Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) syllabus have developed a list of competencies required by engineering students, encouraging universities to meet real-world needs. Intended Outcomes: Rethinking the role of engineering education and the purpose of education in the engineer's professional development, proposing a roadmap for engineering educators, helping them to define which teaching-learning techniques to apply to develop the competencies and skills that university and industry require from future engineers. Application Design: A relationship is shown between the competencies that today's engineers must have according to ABET criterion 3 (i.e., student outcomes), which are required for continuous accreditation of the engineering and CDIO syllabus, and the respective didactic techniques considered in this research. Findings: To develop competencies, students should be taught based on different teaching-learning techniques in higher education. A relationship is proposed for the engineering educator, showing them which didactic technique could be adequate to be applied in the classroom to develop in students the specific competencies established by ABET (SO1 to SO7) and CDIO (SL1 to SL4).;"[Forcael, Eric; Garces, Gonzalo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile; [Orozco, Francisco] Univ Panamer, Coll Engn, Zapopan 45010, Mexico";;Forcael, E (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile.;"eforcael@ubiobio.cl; gegarces@ubiobio.cl; forozco@up.edu.mx";;;;;;79;0;0;8;8;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

Method: This research provides evidence of the reliability and validity of the scale, which is composed of 96 items spread over eight subscales, and completed by a third-party respondent. The validation sample comprised 1060 people with intellectual disability, with ages ranging from 4 to 21 years old (M = 13.51; SD = 5.04). Results: The results suggest that the eight quality of life domains assessed on the scale are reliable (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.812 to 0.949). The evidence of the validity of the construct provided by Confirmatory Factor Analysis also demonstrated adequate indexes of fit for the eight-domain model.

The study included three experiments: (a) the identification of Chilean signs and fingerspelled words, (b) the matching of fingerspelled words with commercial logos, and (c) the decoding of fingerspelled words and the mapping of these words onto the writing system. The results provide convergent evidence that the use of fingerspelling and sign language is related to orthographic skills. It is concluded that fingerspelling can facilitate the internal representation of words and serve as a supporting mechanism for reading acquisition.;"Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Cognit Proc, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Methodol & Behav Sci, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Biofunct Studies, Madrid, Spain; Metropolitan Univ Santiago, Postgrad Sch, Santiago, Chile";;Puente, A (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Psychol, Somosaguas Campus, Madrid, Spain.;;Alvarado, Jesus M./K-7296-2017;Alvarado, Jesus M./0000-0003-4780-0147;;;;49;27;32;1;6;GALLAUDET UNIV PRESS;WASHINGTON;800 FLORIDA AVE NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002 USA;0002-726X;1543-0375;;AM ANN DEAF;Am.

However, given the accelerating demographic, environmental, economical, socio-political, and technological changes-and their associated risks and opportunities-there is increasing consensus that our current educational systems are falling short and that we need to repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Futures of Education initiative was formally launched at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 to provide such a vision of education for the future. The International Scientific and Evidence-based Education (ISEE) Assessment synthesizes knowledge streams generated by different communities and stakeholders at all levels and scales and will thereby essentially contribute to re-envisioning this future of education. The overall aim of the ISEE Assessment is to pool the expertise from a broad range of knowledge holders and stakeholders to undertake a scientifically robust and evidence-based assessment in an open and inclusive manner of our current educational systems and its necessary reforms. In this commentary, we discuss the aims and goals of the ISEE Assessment. We describe how the ISEE Assessment will address key questions on the purpose of education and what, how, where and when we learn, and evaluate the alignment of today's education and theory of learning with the current and forthcoming needs and challenges and to inform policymaking for future education.;"[Duraiappah, Anantha; Mochizuki, Yoko; Ramaswamy, Rajiv; Chatterjee Singh, Nandini] UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Inst Educ Peace & Sustaina, New Delhi, India; [van Atteveldt, Nienke; Buil, J.

The effect of the use of computer simulations in the course shows that the students who were taught with simulation gained a better understanding of linear scheduling concepts and techniques than those students taught without simulation. The data and analysis leading to this finding are presented and discussed in this paper. Two groups of students were considered in this research: (1) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida and (2) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Chile. Each group was randomly separated into two subgroups: one subgroup was taught by using the traditional method of linear scheduling (without the use of computer simulation) and the other subgroup was taught by using simulations. At the end of the teaching period, the students in both subgroups answered an objective test-type questionnaire specifically designed to address their understanding of linear scheduling techniques. They were also required, in a more subjective way, to provide their evaluation of the teaching method involved. To assess the effect of incorporating computer simulation in teaching linear scheduling, the students' evaluations and answers to the questionnaire were statistically compared. The analysis of the responses showed significant differences between the students' understanding of the subject by using the two teaching methods, with the use of computer simulation shown to be a more effective teaching tool for linear scheduling techniques.

In the experimental design, the students were randomly divided into two groups. Traditional teaching sessions were imparted to the first group, which was designated as the control group, whereas the CPM was taught to the second group via the PBL teaching methodology. After the classroom sessions, an evaluation tool was applied: responses were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Fisher statistics, and a set of open-ended questions were qualitatively analyzed via a pattern-matching technique. The results for the group that utilized PBL were favorable; this finding demonstrated the efficiency of this tool for teaching CPM. In addition, the results for the students that applied PBL methodology demonstrated a high degree of acceptance of the CPM methodology, which motivates its implementation into teaching other subjects related to project scheduling in civil engineering.

This definition invites transcending environmental education and education for sustainability's frontiers, examining the ontology, or the 'place', from where actors co-construct these conflicts. If actors don't question the reified and divided assumptions of the 'self' and 'reality' at the base of these conflicts, the creative and transformative potential of becoming together cannot unfold. The transformational learning approach is a coherent way of addressing this challenge, as it promotes an ontological change in actors and their worldview. The training experience offered by the University of Santiago provides insights into how transformational education's perspective can contribute to education in political ecology, inciting an acknowledgment of the self and the world as a complex and dynamic entanglement of actors.;"[Paz Aedo, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, GAMA, Santiago, Chile; [Schaeffer, Colombina] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile";;"Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile.; Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile.";santiago.peredo@usach.cl;;;Universidad de Santiago de Chile [USA 155];This work was supported by Universidad de Santiago de Chile (Project USA 155).;;40;4;4;0;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-4622;1469-5871;;ENVIRON EDUC RES;Environ.

We found that the three scales in either survey (except Sense of Belonging to School in PISA) reached at least metric invariance. The scale scores from the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and the item response theory analysis were highly correlated, pointing to robustness of scaling methods. The correlations between each construct and achievement was generally positive within each culture in each survey, and the correlational pattern was similar across surveys (except for Sense of Belonging), indicating certain convergence in the cross-survey validation.

Hence, learning a manipulative task is generally more effective when watching animations that show natural motions of the task, rather than equivalent static pictures. The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found.

Outsideness is conceived of as a key influence in online academic conversation. In particular, through the sharing of cultural perspectives, asking questions to resolve doubt, and collaborative writing and re-writing as a basis for shaping ideas through reasoning. An analytical framework is proposed and applied to a case study of an international wiki-based project. Key findings are that there is a tension between participants' sense of inside and outside influences, resulting in a complex and challenging working environment. Students require support to develop nuanced questioning and conversational skills, including multi-model forms of representation and communication to enhance language skills.;"[Deed, Craig] La Trobe Univ, Fac Educ, Bendigo, Australia; [Edwards, Anthony] Liverpool Hope Univ, Fac Educ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Gomez, Viviana] Univ Los Lagos, Fac Educ, Osorno, Chile";;Deed, C (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Fac Educ, Bendigo, Australia.;c.deed@latrobe.edu.au;;Deed, Craig/0000-0002-5894-5408;;;;35;1;1;0;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1475-939X;1747-5139;;TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC;Technol.

Based on an unprecedented intervention in the area of music, this paper evaluates the impact of intensive participation of children and young at-risk students in the creation and development of the first youth orchestra of the municipality of Curanilahue, a small and poor county in the south of Chile, South America. After confronting many potential sources of selection bias in the impact estimation-self-selection, parents selection, orchestra selection, payment capacity-we found positive effects of this experience on participants at both the cognitive and socio-emotional levels. We found that orchestra participation positively affects both language and mathematics in SAT-like tests. The estimated impacts are in the upper bound of the impact evaluation sizes range in the developing world (e.g. Duflo et al., 2013; McEwan, 2012; Ganimian and Murnane, 2016). Furthermore, having analyzed the increase in test scores for those students participating in the orchestra who take the test more than once, we find results that indicate a progressive increase in their scores, both in mathematics and in language, an indicator that can be considered as a proxy of socio-emotional outcomes related to the orientation and persistence to obtain personal goals.";"[Egana-delSol, Pablo] Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;"Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.";"pegana@mit.edu; dcontrer@econ.uchile.cl; jp.valenzuelab@gmail.com";;;"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Millennium Nucleus of Social Development - Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile); PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";We would like to thank Jere Behrman, Cristian Bellei, Ernesto Trevino, Amanda Telias, Miguel Urquiola and Stephen Wu for their comments and suggestions on previous versions.

Relying on an exploratory qualitative design, data were collected through focus groups and photo-narratives. The findings show that these teachers understand that child-centred pedagogy is the pillar of their professional identity; that they perceive that this is under threat from the schoolification of early childhood education; and that they admit that their capacity to resist this tendency is limited to the classroom.

The purpose of this study was to gauge students' visual attention in their Mathematics and English classrooms. This article reports on a study conducted in three schools in Santiago, Chile, where a sample of 113 randomly selected students wore a mini-video camera mounted on eyeglass in their Mathematics and English lessons. Using Google images, we automatically and objectively examined 723,600 frames from the recordings where the classroom teacher appeared in the students' visual field. The results show that students' visual attention varies depending on four factors: (a) gender of the student, (b) age of the students, whether students are low/high attainers and (d) whether students are in English or Mathematics lessons. Surprisingly, students significantly paid more visual attention in their Mathematics than in English lessons. High attainers were more visually engaged than their low attainers counterparts. Students appeared to be visually engaged differently at different stages in their education. Furthermore, girls were more visually engaged than boys. The results of this study can have enormous practical implications for teachers and teacher education, in order to be better visually engaged with students during teaching.;"[Farsani, Danyal] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Radmehr, Farzad; Zakariya, Yusuf Feyisara] Univ Agder, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Math Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Radmehr, Farzad] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Teacher Educ Culture & Sport, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway; [Alizadeh, Mohadaseh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Math Sci, Dept Appl Math, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran";;Farsani, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;danyal.farsani@gmail.com;"Zakariya, Yusuf F/G-2868-2017; Radmehr, Farzad/S-3150-2018";"Zakariya, Yusuf F/0000-0002-5266-8227; Radmehr, Farzad/0000-0002-0592-9148; Farsani, Danyal/0000-0002-9412-3161; Alizadeh, Mohadeseh/0000-0002-9883-1835";"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170062]";"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: FB0003; FONDECYT, Grant/Award Number: 3170062";;49;1;2;2;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

This paper explores the discursive production of students with special educational needs in the context of professional development (PD) for collaborative problem-solving teaching. We held interviews with Chilean primary school teachers after their participation in PD and used a post-structural analysis to examine them. We turned to policy and institutional practices to understand the disability discourses that were evident. Teachers called on medical and deficit discourses to produce these students as abnormal and problematic in their learning of mathematics. Yet teachers also blurred the lines of categorisation between and within labels of special needs, including other students in these terms. Simultaneously, the reform PD created space for a counter discourse of ability. We suggest PD should help teachers of mathematics resist deficit discourses and see the ways in which experience may run contrary to them.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand; [Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile";;Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand.;l.darragh@auckland.ac.nz;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;"Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710; Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094";"CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160469, 3180238]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";The research reported in this paper was made possible by funding from the following funding sources: CONICYT/FONDECYT No. 3160469 and No. 3180238, and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.;;48;6;6;2;4;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

In such systems, the actors are encouraged to strive for continuous development in learning organisations based on teamwork, distributed leadership, and professional learning communities. School leaders are positioned between district level administrators and teachers in such processes and have the responsibility to secure professional development. Using the implementation of the national program 'Assessment for Learning' in Norway as a case, the article shows that leaders approach professional development differently. Analyses of interviews with leaders from 7 schools reveal three distinct approaches related to how school leaders perceive knowledge. Some school leaders assume that teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills and trust them to manage the implementation process without leader support. Other school leaders distrust teachers' knowledge and skills and assume that the proper knowledge exists outside the school. These leaders seek external support when they meet teacher resistance. In a third approach, school leaders assume that knowledge develops through collaboration and thereby engage with teachers in continuous judgment about the implementation procedure. In the discussion, questions of trust and distrust are analysed in relation to how professional knowledge is developed and how professional discretion can support the development of intelligent accountability in schools.;"[Tolo, Astrid] Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England; [Florez Petour, Maria Teresa] Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Hopfenbeck, Therese N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr Educ Assessment, Dept Educ, Oxford, England";;Tolo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway.;"astrid.tolo@uib.no; solvi.lillejord@uib.no; mtflorez@u.uchile.cl; therese.hopfenbeck@education.ox.ac.uk";;;;;;94;3;3;1;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1389-2843;1573-1812;;J EDUC CHANG;J.

In this article, we seek to understand Chilean teachers' collective identity performances after PD into collaborative problem-solving mathematics. We undertook a classical thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews held with 10 primary school teachers 18months after their participation in PD. We present an innovative report of our findings by combining the interview analysis into a movie synopsis and creating a fictional protagonist, Tia (aunty' in Spanish), who represents the common findings from the ten teachers. We found the attractive identities performed by teachers, in particular the mother-saviour' and the successful' teacher, conflicted with their understandings of the teacher role promoted by PD. We argue the unique method of combining data allowed for reporting findings with both breadth and depth and this enabled us to see the way in which identities are culturally and contextually produced. We suggest PD needs to cater to these attractive teacher identities in order to be successful and sustainable in the long term.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Radovic, Darinka] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.;l.darragh@auckland.ac.nz;;Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710;"CONICYT Proyectos Fondecyt Post-doctorado [3160469, 3180291]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003, AFB170001]; Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS [2807]";"We wish to acknowledge the following funding sources: CONICYT Proyectos Fondecyt Post-doctorado #3160469 and #3180291; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 (CIAE) and AFB170001 (CMM) and Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.";;40;2;2;1;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology was adopted via the case study method through which the case of a sixth-grade Chilean teacher participating in the study was documented. The data were collected through a lesson plan, a videotape of the implemented lesson and a questionnaire. A professional digital competence framework for teachers provided an analytical perspective via data analysis. Findings The results show that the teacher displayed digital competence in a synchronous collaborative learning environment in which she had time to reflect on the educational value of technology and appropriate teaching methods involving information and communication technologies. Certain elements of the studied case contributed to this performance, namely the cross-border context, the classroom setting and the collaborative Lesson Study methodology. Practical implications The lesson study methodology facilitated the teacher's performance in the Pedagogy and didactics digital competence by enabling her to participate in planning and implementing a lesson that allowed all those who collaborated, including teachers and researchers, to reflect on teaching in a digital learning environment. Social implications The cross-border context, which involved co-designing and implementing a lesson in two countries, allowed the teacher to display her School in society and Ethics competencies. This was achieved through connecting two classrooms with different languages and cultures digitally and synchronously, thereby providing students the opportunity to debate and participate in a global and local problem such as a country's responsibility for energy consumption. Originality/value Modern society requires the transformation of school practices, and new teaching approaches should include the provision of collaborative spaces that incorporate digital technologies. In this sense, this paper shows that cross-border lessons involving a synchronous learning environment offer a potential alternative, as digital teaching competence enables teachers to bring together different social and cultural groups virtually, thereby contributing to the reduction of social gaps and to the promotion of positive identity among less advantaged students.;"[Isoda, Masami] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Estrella, Soledad; Zakaryan, Diana; Olfos, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Baldin, Yuriko] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Araya, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Estrella, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;soledad.estrella@pucv.cl;Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022;"estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914; Araya, Roberto/0000-0003-2598-8994";"ANID Fondecyt [1200346]; FONDEF [ID20i10070]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP19K21743, JP26245082]; VRIEA [039.439/2020]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";"The authors are thankful to the support from ANID Fondecyt 1200346; FONDEF ID20i10070; JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K21743, JP26245082; VRIEA 039.439/2020 and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003.";;25;2;2;7;10;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2046-8253;2016-8261;;INT J LESSON LEARN S;Int.

Taking an entrepreneurial competency approach, we explore the potential impact of introducing an entrepreneurship education course to doctoral students based within a non-commercial research environment. We identified two main areas of possible impact: the potential effects upon doctoral research projects and upon the doctoral students themselves. We followed the learning experiences of science and technology PhD students before, during, and a year after an entrepreneurial course through a multiple case study research design. Our results suggest that entrepreneurship education has a positive impact upon the development of student's creative problem-solving and communication skills. This was reported to have a generally positive effect upon the students' doctoral projects and on the student's self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions.

The aim is to reverse the high failure and attrition rate among engineering undergraduates taking physics. A number of tests and questionnaires were administered to a group of students following a traditional lecture-based instruction, as well as to another group that was following an instruction scheme based on the proposed approach and the teaching materials developed ad hoc. The results show that students following the new method can develop scientific reasoning habits in problem-solving skills, and show gains in conceptual learning, attitudes and interests, and that the effects of this approach on learning are noticeable several months after the course is over.;"[Becerra-Labra, Carlos] Univ Talca, Inst Matemat & Fis, Talca, Chile; [Gras-Marti, Albert] Univ Los Andes, CIFE LIDIE, Bogota, Colombia; [Gras-Marti, Albert] Univ Los Andes, Dept Fis, Bogota, Colombia; [Gras-Marti, Albert; Martinez Torregrosa, Joaquin] Univ Alacant, Alacant, Spain";;Becerra-Labra, C (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Inst Matemat & Fis, Talca, Chile.;cbecerra@utalca.cl;TORREGROSA, JOAQUÍN MARTÍNEZ/H-4921-2012;TORREGROSA, JOAQUÍN MARTÍNEZ/0000-0002-8229-5812;;;;58;16;16;2;38;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

The main research question is whether innovative interfaces affect test response time and/or response accuracy. This study compared performance on banked cloze tests using a conventional interface (based on paper-based formats for responding by writing a number in a box) versus cloze tests with improved interfaces (based on computer-based affordances such as dragging and dropping responses to fill in a blank). In a banked cloze test, the left side of the page shows a text with words deleted and replaced with blanks that are numbered, and the right side shows the word list with a space to write in the corresponding number. In Experiment 1, 56 fourth graders in the conventional group responded more slowly but just as accurately, and spent more time looking at the word list on the right of the screen but spent equivalent time looking at the text as compared to a group that took the test with an improved interface. In Experiment 2, the same pattern of results was replicated with 148 sixth graders and for each of three versions of improved interfaces as compared to the conventional interface. Results support the idea that the improved interface affected the response execution phase but not the response development phase of performance on the cloze test.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Econ & Management, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sitthiworachart, Jirarat] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Ind Educ & Technol, 1 Soi Chalongkrung 1, Bangkok 10520, Thailand; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Econ & Management, Av LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.;"hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; jirarat.si@kmitl.ac.th; mario.lopez@usach.cl";Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";;;;40;1;1;3;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1042-1629;1556-6501;;ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES;ETR&D-Educ.

Urban teacher education and rural schools: directors' point of view;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Teacher education; rural education; social justice; Chile; multi-grade classrooms";"DIVERSITY; RIGHTS";Policymakers and teacher educators have long discussed whether specialised preparation of teachers who work in rural areas is necessary. The objective of this research is to learn more about teacher educators' perspectives on the efficacy of urban-based teacher education in preparing elementary school teachers for rural contexts. The research was undertaken in a city in the Araucania region of Chile. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the directors of three teacher education programmes. Those interviewed reported concerns about multi-grade classrooms often found in rural schools, which were understood to be an anomaly of proper elementary education. They also reported that the teacher education programmes they directed, though not aligned with teaching in rural schools, were sufficient in preparing new teachers. Preparation in teaching children in rural settings was not offered, or, in some cases, offered on the periphery as a programme option. This research reveals a disconnect between urban-based, urban-oriented teacher education programmes and the rural communities they aim to serve. It also adds to the broader discussion surrounding the preparation of teachers for diverse contexts.;"[Silva-Pena, Ilich] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile; [Precht, Andrea] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social, Fac Educ, Curico, Chile; [O'Brien, Thomas, V] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Educ, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Jara, Carin] Univ Santo Tomas, Bogota, Colombia";;Silva-Pena, I (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile.;ilichsp@gmail.com;Precht, Andrea/H-4506-2015;"Precht, Andrea/0000-0002-2435-5565; Silva-Pena, Ilich/0000-0001-9118-3989";"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship [611.3]";"This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico: [Grant Number, 1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship 611.3.";;54;1;1;7;19;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

To analyze the relationship between institutional factors and within-school segregation, it uses a logistic regression, controlling for a set of school characteristics. This analysis finds that within-school segregation is related to institutional factors such as school size and the characteristics of their students. To determine the effects of within-school segregation on academic performance, a multilevel regression model is used, organized in three levels: school, classroom and student. The results show that within-school segregation has negative consequences on educational quality, efficiency and equity, since internal segregation reduces the average educational outcomes of the schools and mostly affects students of middle groups within the school in both academic achievement and socioeconomic terms.

To establish whether analogy making plays a role in this process of learning, we devised a classroom game based on an analysis of a number-line analogy that leverages children' spatial intuitions for helping them understand the numbers. To investigate the role of spatial positioning along the number line, seventy-seven preschoolers were randomly assigned to control tasks (control condition) or to embodied number line tasks in two possible spatial locations: watching numbers increasing either from left to right (space-number alignment condition) or from right to left (space-number misalignment condition) Performing-learning activities for roughly two hours promoted children's proficiency in four tasks of numerical knowledge, but only children under spatial and numerical alignment increased their proficiency in a task of number line estimation. This finding shows that the numerical representations generated by children during training were integrated with spatial information that was implicit in the learning activities, thus revealing that analogical alignments play a key role in the formation of early numerical representations. Additionally, this study illustrates that interrogating the analogy at the foundation of an instructional activity highlights key instructional decisions that can have a large impact on learning. Future research along this line might provide a framework for using analogy at the foundations of instructional design.;"[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile; [Gomez, David M.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, CMM, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile.;jnavarrete@ubiobio.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;"Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751; Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436";"INNOVA-BIO-BIO [13.1984-EM.CIE, 14.541-EM.CIE]; Universidad del Bio-Bio [124009 3/D]; FAPEI Fund; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003, PFB03]; CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003, PFB03]";"This research was supported by the INNOVA-BIO-BIO grants 13.1984-EM.CIE and 14.541-EM.CIE.

International evidence suggests that these gender differences reflect gender inequities in educational and economic opportunities available in a given culture. A theoretical model suggests that sociocultural factors such as gender stereotype and math anxiety have an impact on women's math abilities by affecting their skills for cognitive reflection. This cross-sectional study collected data from 259 university students to gather preliminary evidence on the close relationship between gender gaps in math achievement and gender gaps in cognitive reflection. A mediation analysis shows that the level of cognitive reflection of students fully mediates the effect of gender on math achievement, even after controlling for participants' linguistic abilities. These findings support the possibility that there is a close relationship between gender differences in cognitive reflection and gender gaps in math achievement at university admission in Chile. The discussion emphasizes that the university admission's data is under the control of state agencies with strict protocols of information access that undermines the feasibility of researching this area. Assessments of cognitive reflection are easy to administer in only a few minutes and under laboratory conditions. Hence, one way to boost the viability of research and diagnosis of gender gaps in Chile is to use cognitive reflection assessments as proximal estimates for gender gaps in math performance at university admission.;"[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Ctr Estudios Nuble, Chillan, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Grp Invest Genero Ciudadania & Equidad GI 170424, Chillan, Chile";;Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile.;"jairo.navarrete@uoh.cl; jsandoval@ubiobio.cl";Sandoval-Díaz, José/AAT-3262-2021;"Sandoval-Díaz, José/0000-0001-7247-7113; Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [19I10030];This research was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de Chile, by funding of Program FONDEF Grant ID19I10030.;;62;0;0;1;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1381-2890;1573-1928;;SOC PSYCHOL EDUC;Soc.

This tendency has resulted in cannabis consumption being accepted by society as if it were harmless. However, evidence shows that the use of this drug has detrimental effects on cognitive, academic, and professional performance, which tend to be larger in younger users (e.g., high school students). In this review article, we focus on the decline of visuospatial processing associated with cannabis consumption in nondependent or nonclinical high school students. We start by providing evidence of the pivotal role of visuospatial processing for learning. Next, we review experimental and correlational evidence of declines in visuospatial processing related to cannabis use. Three types of correlational studies are considered: (a) comparisons of declines between visuospatial processing and other cognitive tasks, (b) studies comparing declines between high school students and adult participants, and (c) stringent correlational studies (e.g., large samples, longitudinal data, twin studies). We also include evidence in abstinent cannabis conditions. We conclude that using cannabis may moderately impair visuospatial processing and learning in nondependent high school students, although the effects could disappear under abstinence and tend to be lower than on other cognitive functions.

This paper presents the background, methods and results of a new simulation management game called LEBSCO, which simulates aspects of the Last Planner System (LPS) and Lean Production principles. LPS is central to the implementation of Lean Construction, an increasingly popular management approach based on the Toyota Production System and Lean Production. LPS requires continuous and collaborative effort from all stakeholders for the planning and control of a construction project, making it especially appropriate for the experiential learning allowed by simulation. LEBSCO consists of the assembly of Lego pieces to form a schematic house, and it is played by teams meeting in rounds simulating weeks of work. Each team is composed of stakeholders, such as a planner, resource suppliers and trade foremen, mirroring the planning and control process of a typical construction project. Participants build the Lego houses first using a Traditional management approach and then using Lean-based approach.

Consequently, the influence of the clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students' intrinsic motivation. The aim of this study was to describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. MethodsA qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. FindingsSeveral themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and constructive feedback; delivery of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. ConclusionsOur findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomy-supportive style to motivate their patients.";"[Orsini, C.; Evans, P.; Binnie, V.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, FEN, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Ledezma, P.; Fuentes, F.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Santiago, Chile";;Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, 27 Hillhead St, Glasgow G12 8PX, Lanark, Scotland.;corsini@fen.uchile.cl;Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019;"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-2087-6662";;;;45;19;20;1;53;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

However, current efforts do not provide a comprehensive view of the way their students learn music before starting university. The objective of this study is to portray their musical experiences, identifying the distinctive mechanisms underlying the relationship between practices, repertoires, and training contexts for music learning. A combination of pedagogical, social and musical dimensions, inspired by sociological theories of P. Bourdieu and B. Bernstein, examine the pre-university musical experiences and the mediating role of students' sociocultural origins. Empirically, multimodal information from four Chilean universities (n = 55) was collected through the application of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed using a set of mixed techniques, including descriptive statistics, text mining, and content analysis. Findings reveal relevant associations between practices, repertoires, and learning contexts, especially in terms of the specialized nature of musical training and the habitus and cultural dispositions of practitioners. Particularly relevant is the predominance of informal and non-formal learning contexts and their translation into specific types of learning. These challenge current perspectives and contribute a tool kit for the understanding of the relationship between power and knowledge in future professional teachers.;"[Poblete, Carlos; Carreno, Barbara] Univ OHiggins, Rancagua, Chile; [Leguina, Adrian] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Masquiaran, Nicolas] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";;Leguina, A (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci, Quantitat Social Sci, Brockington Bldg, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.;A.Leguina@lboro.ac.uk;"Leguina, Adrian/AAX-6455-2020; ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020";"Leguina, Adrian/0000-0002-9229-2033; ";PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003];Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.;;46;3;4;1;14;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0255-7614;1744-795X;;INT J MUSIC EDUC;Int.

To isolate preferences for those goods, we implement an online discrete choice experiment using social statistics generated from true variation among commuting zones. We find that, ceteris paribus, the average income that individuals are willing to sacrifice is (1) $4,984 to increase higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation (14 percent); (2) $1,168 to decrease rich/poor gaps in higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation (8 percent); and (3) $2,900 to decrease the 90/10 income inequality ratio by 1 standard deviation (1.66). In addition, we find that political affiliation is an important moderator of preferences for equality. While both Democrats and Republicans are willing to trade over $4,000 to increase higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation, Democrats are willing to sacrifice nearly three times more income to decrease either rich/poor gaps in higher education enrollment or the 90/10 income inequality ratio by 1 standard deviation.";"[Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Shores, Kenneth A.] Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";;"Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Shores, KA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.";"blara@utalca.cl; kshores@psu.edu";Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019;Shores, Kenneth/0000-0003-3039-420X;;;;43;0;0;0;1;MIT PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA;1557-3060;1557-3079;;EDUC FINANC POLICY;Educ.

The aim is to establish a standardized, compatible and flexible European university system that enables graduates and undergraduates to move easily from one institution to another within Europe. As a result of evaluation mechanisms, the system will be transparent and of high quality, which will make it attractive and competitive internationally in a globalized world. In this paper, we focus on two distance learning modes that will become more important as a result of this change in universities: e-learning and b-learning. These basically involve the virtualization of learning processes through the use of computer equipment. We carried out a qualitative study using the case study method. The results indicate that teaching staff use information and communication technology (ICT) to improve student learning. Similarly, a high percentage (78%) of lecturers use some form of digital platform as a support for teaching. In conclusion, training policies should strengthen university teachers' skills in the use of ICT equipment, tools and resources related to blended and virtual learning.;"[Imbernon Munoz, Francisco] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Fac Pedag, Barcelona, Spain; [Guzman Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Valparaiso, Chile";;Munoz, FI (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Fac Pedag, Barcelona, Spain.;"fimbernon@ub.edu; patriciasilva@ub.edu; carolina.guzman@uv.cl";"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020; Silva, Patricia PS/D-7149-2017; Imbernón, Francisco FIM/K-5356-2014";"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Silva, Patricia PS/0000-0001-5651-296X; Imbernón, Francisco FIM/0000-0001-7566-6358";;;;31;45;45;3;58;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2011;18;36;;;;;107;114;;10.3916/C36-2011-03-01;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";716RY;WOS:000286992400013;;Green Published, gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

The latter was based on the self-determination theory's concepts of differentiation of autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation. MethodsA cross-sectional correlational study was conducted where 924 students completed self-reported questionnaires measuring motivation, perception of the learning climate, feedback and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha scores and bivariate correlations were computed. Mediation of basic needs on each predictor-outcome association was tested based on a series of regression analyses. Finally, all variables were integrated into one structural equation model, controlling for the effects of age, gender and year of study. ResultsCronbach's alpha scores were acceptable (.655 to .905). Correlation analyses showed positive and significant associations between both an autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback received, and students' autonomous motivation, which decreased and became negative when correlated with controlled motivation and amotivation, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that these associations were indirect and mediated by how these predictors satisfied students' basic psychological needs. These results were corroborated by the structural equation analysis, in which data fit the model well and regression paths were in the expected direction. ConclusionAn autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback were positive predictors of students' autonomous motivation and negative predictors of amotivation. However, this was an indirect association mediated by the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs. Consequently, supporting students' needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness might lead to optimal types of motivation, which has an important influence on dental education.;"[Orsini, C.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, Teaching & Learning Ctr, FEN, Santiago, Chile; [Binnie, V.; Wilson, S.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Med Dent & Nursing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";;Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Santiago, Chile.;cesar.orsini@gmail.com;Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019;"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812";Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream;Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream 2015-2016;;41;13;13;4;43;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Objectives This study's main objectives were to determine whether the curriculum and the faculty teaching practices of the School of Dentistry at the University of Chile contribute to its students' commitment to ethical and social responsibility. Methods This was a qualitative study that investigated the perceptions of sixteen subjects (eight students and eight faculty members). Data were collected in thorough deep interviews. The interview process model conceptualised and organised the information into sets of dimensions and categories. The dimensions studied were ethical commitment and social responsibility. The categories assessed within ethical commitment were honesty, tolerance, responsibility and respect. In the social responsibility dimension, the categories were solidarity, teamwork and concern for and communication with the patient. Analysis of the textual data was performed using a method of content analysis based upon constructed qualitative matrices. Results Our results show that students and scholars alike realise that ethical commitment and a sense of social responsibility are not promoted in the curriculum. They do, however, recognise the importance of these qualities in dental practitioners. Conclusions These results indicate that the current curriculum and teaching practices used in our School of Dentistry need to be reviewed and that programmes promoting professionals' commitment to their role in society need to be implemented.;"[Gonzalez, F.

Implementing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that repeating an early grade in primary school decreases the probability of committing a crime as a juvenile by 14.5 percentage points. By estimating and simulating a dynamic model, we show that the RD result is mainly driven by two mechanisms related to the timing of grade retention. First, grade retention in early grades decreases the probability of grade retention in late primary school grades. Second, late grade retention in primary education has a positive and more relevant effect on crime than the direct effect in early grades. Our findings support the argument that, conditional on the decision to keep grade retention as an ongoing policy, the optimal implementation at the margin is to retain students in early grades in order to avoid retention in later ones.;"[Diaz, Juan] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management Control & Informat Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas; Rivera, Jorge] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes, Tatiana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;"juadiaz@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl; tatiana_reyes@berkeley.edu; jrivera@econ.uchile.cl";;;;;;39;0;0;6;6;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

The comments of anxious and non-anxious language learners were audiorecorded as they watched themselves interact in a videotaped oral interview. By examining the reactions of the language learners to their actual oral performance and analyzing the audio-tapes for instances of perfectionism, evidence was gathered suggesting that anxious and non-anxious learners differ in their personal performance standards, procrastination, fear of evaluation, and concern over errors. Because the results of this study indicated a link between language anxiety and perfectionism, the article ends with a discussion of procedures that have been used to overcome perfectionism and that may also be helpful to anxious foreign language learners.;"Univ Atacama, Copiapo, Chile; Univ Texas, Austin, TX 78712 USA";;Gregersen, T (corresponding author), Univ Atacama, Copayapu 485, Copiapo, Chile.;;Gregersen, Tammy/AAJ-1209-2021;Gregersen, Tammy/0000-0003-0744-9655;;;;21;189;194;5;57;BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS;MALDEN;350 MAIN STREET, STE 6, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA;0026-7902;;;MOD LANG J;Mod.

All this with the purpose of using Digital Technologies (DT) to improve teaching and professional development. This paper presents a study focused on the diagnosis of TDC among ITT senior students from Chile and Uruguay. A quantitative methodology, with a representative sample of 568 students (N=273 from Chile and N=295 from Uruguay) was designed and implemented. TDC was also studied and discussed in relation to gender and educational level. Results showed a mostly basic level for the four dimensions of the TDC in the sample. Regarding the relationship between the variables and the TDC, the Planning, organization and management of spaces and technological resources' dimension is the only one showing significant differences. In particular, male students achieved a higher TDC level compared with female students. Furthermore, the proportion of Primary Education students with a low TDC level was significantly higher than other students. In conclusion, it is necessary, for teacher training institutions in Chile and Uruguay, to implement policies at different moments and in different areas of the ITT process in order to improve the development of the TDC.;"[Silva, Juan] Univ Santiago, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Silva, Juan] Univ Santiago, Ctr Invest & Innovac Educ & TIC, Santiago, Chile; [Usart, Mireia] Univ Rovira & Virgili Tarragona, Dept Pedag, Tarragona, Spain; [Lazaro-Cantabrana, Jose-Luis] Univ Rovira & Virgili Tarragona, Fac Ciencias Educ & Psicol, Comis Serv, Tarragona, Spain";;"Silva, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Silva, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago, Ctr Invest & Innovac Educ & TIC, Santiago, Chile.";"juan.silva@usach.cl; mireia.usart@urv.cat; joseluis.lazaro@urv.cat";Usart, Mireia/N-5982-2018;"Usart, Mireia/0000-0003-4372-9312; Lazaro-Cantabrana, Jose L./0000-0001-9689-603X; Silva Quiroz, Juan Eusebio/0000-0002-9817-402X";;;;40;15;15;2;13;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;OCT 1;2019;27;61;;;;;33;43;;10.3916/C61-2019-03;;;11;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";JZ0BA;WOS:000504768000003;;gold, Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published;;;2022-04-06;

These policies, initiated under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, did not change with the new democratic governments after 1990. This characteristic led international organizations to promote the Chilean policies in different contexts in Latin America and beyond. In 2006, a high school student movement occupied public and private schools, demystifying the outcomes of these policies. A new wave of demonstrations took place in 2011, with a college student leadership that paralyzed a significant amount of universities and schools throughout the country. After both waves of mobilizations, the political system opened the process of policy-making that considered the demands of social movements. In this article, we explore the dynamics between educational policies and social student movements in Chile, and the possibilities of change in favor of public education.;"[Inzunza, Jorge] Delavan Darien Sch, Turtle Creek Elementary Sch, Delavan, WI USA; [Assael, Jenny; Cornejo, Rodrigo; Redondo, Jesus] Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Inzunza, J (corresponding author), Delavan Darien Sch Dist, 125 S Walworth St, Darien, WI 53114 USA.;jinzunzah@gmail.com;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; redondo rojo, jesus maria/M-9231-2018";"redondo rojo, jesus maria/0000-0002-5562-2590; Inzunza, Jorge/0000-0001-5231-6996; Cornejo Chavez, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6713-0166";"PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; FONDECYT (Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180801]";"Support from PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003; FONDECYT (Chile) No 1160445 and; FONDECYT (Chile) No 1180801.";;60;8;9;0;26;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-5692;1465-3346;;BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC;Br.

However, evidence about which of a school's attributes really drives parental choice is still scarce. We use census data from a parent questionnaire in Chile, a country with a national school choice and competition system, to describe the attributes most commonly considered by parents when choosing a school, and to assess how the probability of prioritizing those attributes varies with the parents socioeconomic characteristics, while controlling for other characteristics of the family. We find that parents choosing a school prioritize its proximity, its quality, and whether it provides religious education. Furthermore, the probability of parents prioritizing proximity is higher for parents of low socioeconomic status, while the probability of them prioritizing quality and religious education is higher for parents of high socioeconomic status. These findings show that only advantaged families choose schools based on their quality, and therefore school choice and competition policies may offer a limited benefit for disadvantaged pupils, possibly maintaining or reinforcing socioeconomic segregation in the education system.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Gelber, Denisse] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Tellez Canas, Santiago] Univ Externado Colombia, Bogota, Colombia";;Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile.;"alvaro.hofflinger@ufrontera.cl; dgelber@uc.cl; santiago.tellez@uexternado.edu.co";;Gelber, Denisse/0000-0001-6073-5808;National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007, REDI 170019];We are grateful for the funds provided by the National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007 and REDI 170019], which contributed to this research.;;61;5;5;5;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

The school competition theory holds that achievement rises when students can choose among competing schools. The school resources theory holds that achievement rises with schools' resources per student. The family resources theory holds that achievement rises as parents become more educated and earn higher incomes. We test all three theories in Chile between 2002 and 2013, when reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, as school competition, school resources, and family resources all increased. We compare Chilean municipalities in a difference-in-differences analysis, asking whether test scores rose fastest in municipalities with greater increases in school competition, school resources, or family resources. We find that municipal test scores did not rise with school competition but did rise with family resources (parental education, not income) and, to a smaller extent, with school resources (as measured by class sizes). Results favor the family resource theory, and to a lesser extent the school resource theory, but not the school competition theory.;"[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Publ Policy Sociol Stat & Data Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA";;von Hippel, PT (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com;;;;;;61;3;3;0;12;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0038-0407;1939-8573;;SOCIOL EDUC;Sociol.

To deal with selection bias, we use propensity score matching to compare the test scores of reduced-fee paying, low-income students in fee-charging private voucher schools to those of similar students in public schools and free private voucher schools. Our results reveal that students in fee-charging private voucher schools score slightly higher than students in public schools. The difference in standardized test scores is approximately 10 points, a test score gain of 0.2 standard deviations. We find no difference in the academic achievement of students in the fee-charging private voucher treatment group relative to their Counterparts in free private voucher schools.

Aspects of the course design which were considered particularly effective were the use of scaffolded assessment, the application of threshold concepts, and well-structured collaborative learning activities paired with quality tutors. The key learning for the authors from the evaluation of the course was that while the tools and strategies developed were very useful, interweaving these tools into year 2 and 3 courses would help students see the ongoing value of critical thinking in their work.;"[Whiley, Dona; Witt, Bradd; Colvin, R.

Two factors were assessed: the level of admissions selectivity by the university attended, and the salary received once employed. The participants graduated from three universities in Chile, one public and two private selected as representing three levels of university selectivity. The sample was constructed by random selection among five cohorts of graduates, from 2012 to 2016. A self-report questionnaire was administered on two occasions, in 2015 for the first three cohorts and in 2017 for the last two. The obtained sample included 587 graduates, in Psychology and in Teaching of Basic Education. The results reveal that selectivity is related to graduates' satisfaction with their university experience; the more selective the university in which they are admitted, the more graduates are satisfied. Salary, on the other hand, is related to satisfaction only in the case of the least selective university. The findings provide some directions for how universities can improve graduates' satisfaction.";"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Tarapaca, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo; Loyola, Javier; Castillo, Dante] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ PIIE, Santiago, Chile; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana UTEM, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, Swampscott, MA USA";;Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Tarapaca, Chile.;oespinoza@academia.cl;"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019";"Castillo, Dante/0000-0002-5648-0627; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; LOYOLA, JAVIER/0000-0001-8336-6873; Sandoval, Luis/0000-0001-9452-4945; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151016];This research was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT Project No1151016.

Yet we know little about the politics of improving education. One significant and instructive case of reforms designed to boost education quality comes from Chile, where in 2016 the government enacted a sweeping reform of teaching careers. This paper first uses a quantitative analysis of appearances in the news to identify key stakeholders and then turns to process tracing to analyze how and when these stakeholders influenced reform dynamics. Comparatively, the Chilean case differs from similar reforms elsewhere in Latin America due to the absence of business, the strong role of policy networks, and the final negotiated settlement with the teacher union. Theoretically, the analysis confirms general theories that emphasize the roles of distributive politics and policy networks.;"[Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Schneider, Ben] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schneider, Ben] Stellenbosch Univ, Stellenbosch Inst Adv Study STIAS, Wallenberg Res Ctr, Stellenbosch, South Africa";;Schneider, B (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;brs@mit.edu;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013";"Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Schneider, Ben/0000-0001-9227-7805";;;;59;6;6;3;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

Teaching modules were designed based on the secondary physics curricula in Finland (Helsinki) and Chile (Santiago and Vina del Mar) emphasising students engagement in scientific practices. The study was implemented in four classrooms in both countries. Data on situational interest and ongoing classroom activities were obtained using the experience sampling method, with measurements taken three times during a lesson. The process yielded a total of 1717 measurements in the Finnish schools and 1767 in the Chilean schools. Multilevel regression analyses with mixed effects and random intercept were conducted. Results showed a positive effect of scientific practices that required asking questions, designing scientific inquiry and interpreting data on situational interest. Student collaborative situations were more interesting for Chilean students than for Finnish ones. In terms of gender differences, on average, Finnish male and female students experienced the same level of situational interest, while the situational interest of Chilean female students was higher than the average of male students. Personal interest in science studies and careers was the best predictor of situational interest in both countries.;"[Lavonen, Jari; Upadyaya, Katja; Juuti, Kalle; Inkinen, Janna; Salmela-Aro, Katariina] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Lavonen, Jari] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Childhood Educ, Soweto, South Africa; [Avalos, Beatrice; Araneda, Sebastian] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Cumsille, Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Lavonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9, Helsinki 00014, Finland.;jari.lavonen@helsinki.fi;;"salmela-aro, katariina/0000-0003-1901-4712; Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953; Upadyaya, Katja/0000-0002-4793-1799; Araneda, Sebastian/0000-0002-2845-0340; Juuti, Kalle/0000-0001-8696-2611; Inkinen, Sini Janna Maria/0000-0003-2856-4601; Cumsille, Patricio/0000-0002-3911-2910";"Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [294228, 298323]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";This work was supported by the Academy of Finland (#294228 and #298323) and by the ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and Joint Research Projects CONICYT-AKAEDU 2015.;;75;0;0;9;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

The aims of this research were twofold: to identify the participants' perceptions about reading and writing in Mapuzugun and to analyze the pedagogical practices involving literacy in the classroom. Results show that literacy is not a central aspect in beliefs of the traditional educators charged with teaching the intercultural curriculum, despite there being a wide range of literacy practices displayed in the classrooms. We argue that literacy practices play a relevant role in the construction of hybrid social identities that bring together traditional school practices and a community's oral strategies.

The notion that interactants can modify their affective output in such fashion is referred in the literature as affective alignment (Ochs, 1988). By using linguistic anthropological methods, audio and video recordings of naturally occurring conversation involving 17 students and two teachers were analyzed for the use of verbal and non-verbal affective behavior. The analysis showed that students actively participated in an on-going negotiation of affective practices with their teachers. Moreover, learning the heritage language was related to and dependent upon other affective factors beyond students' immediate educational and instructional need. These findings provide us with a better understanding of the influence of the teachers' and students' affective behavior on one another, and on students' acquisition of their heritage language.

This study explores the educational inclusion of girls in mathematics classrooms. The coding of videos from 79 school lessons, involving 2,295 students, allowed us to compare how and how much teachers interact with male and female students, analyse the moderating effect of academic achievement in these interactions and explore the differences among classrooms with regard to the inclusion of girls. Teacher-student interaction networks were represented via sociograms and modelled with multilevel Poisson regression. We found that girls interact less frequently with their mathematics teachers in interactions of diverse content, and this is the case in interactions initiated by the teacher as well as those initiated by the student.

A sample of 1684 university students in New Zealand participated in this study. Students' responses to an open-ended question were first inductively coded and then quantitatively analyzed using Chi-square independence test and logistic regression. The findings identified several situational, dispositional, and institutional factors that hinder student learning, among them financial difficulties and work commitments, health, and family issues were more dominant. These factors are perceived differently by students of different disciplines and ethnicities. For instance, Asian students were less likely to refer to financial difficulties and work commitments compared to the other ethnicities, whereas Pasifika and then Maori students perceived family issues more than other ethnic groups. STEM major students were more likely to believe the teaching quality restricts their learning than their non-STEM counterparts. The study findings have several educational and well-being implications for diverse bodies of students in tertiary education.;"[Radmehr, Farzad; Niazi, Najmeh; Rezvanifard, Faezeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Appl Math, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Radmehr, Farzad] Univ Agder, Dept Math Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Radmehr, Farzad] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway; [Farsani, Danyal] Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Educ Psychol & Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Farsani, Danyal] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Laban, Winnie] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Overton, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bakker, Leon] Victoria Univ Wellington, Planning & Management Informat, Wellington, New Zealand";;Radmehr, F (corresponding author), Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway.;f.radmehr65@gmail.com;"; Radmehr, Farzad/S-3150-2018";"Farsani, Danyal/0000-0002-9412-3161; Radmehr, Farzad/0000-0002-0592-9148";;;;59;0;0;3;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0729-4360;1469-8366;;HIGH EDUC RES DEV;High.

However, its implementation into the curricula of dental schools is still limited. Our objective was to identify the main values related to professionalism based on the perceptions of students and faculty members from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile. Methods A Dental Values Survey was validated and culturally adapted in order to guarantee the greatest possible internal validity. The adapted survey was administered to students and faculty members (416 and 225, respectively). The final survey contained 64 items rated on a Likert scale of 1-5. Each item was categorised according to five dimensions: Altruism, Consciousness, Personal Satisfaction, Quality of Life and Professional Status. The values were compared between faculty and students and among students at different courses. A values scale was constructed by selecting the five items with the highest average score for each dimension. Results Survey respondents composed 34.32% of the universe, of which 50.46% were faculty and 49.54% were students. Values associated with Altruism, Consciousness and Professional Status, were the highest rated by students and faculty. Values associated with Personal Satisfaction and Quality of Life received the lowest scores for both groups. Conclusions To provide the best possible attention to patients (Consciousness), and that patients have access to affordable dental care (Altruism), are the values at the top of our scale. On the other hand, to maintain financial stability and to be well paid (Quality of Life) were the less considered.;"[Alcota, Marcela; Gonzalez, Fermin E.] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Dept Conservat Dent, Santiago, Chile; [Manriquez, Jose M.; Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Inst Res Dent Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Salinas, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Dept Prosthet, Santiago, Chile; [Catano, Victor M.] St Marys Univ, Dept Psychol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Ruiz de Gauna, Pilar] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Educ, Bilbao, Spain";;"Alcota, M; Gonzalez, FE (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Odontol, Dept Odontol Conservadora, Santiago, Chile.";"malcota@u.uchile.cl; fgonzalez@uchile.cl";Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco/I-1332-2013;"Cornejo-Ovalle, Marco/0000-0001-9147-5754; Gonzalez, Fermin E/0000-0002-4212-1009";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica;Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica;;47;0;0;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

As these events involve multiple victims, their identities must be confirmed using the highest possible quality standards. Forensic Odontology (FO) has proven to be a scientific resource for disaster victim identification (DVI) procedures; however, it is highly dependent on the proper management not only of material resources but also of human resources. Chile is a country recognised as prone to natural disasters, but an insufficient number of forensic odontologists has been reported. The aim of the study was to review the literature on a dental undergraduate (UG) student's potential value in a DVI process. Methodology A scoping review was performed using a specific search strategy in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO and EBSCO databases. Results The search identified 27 articles in which the basic dental degree, the necessary training and the need for human resources are variables considered in different priorities by those articles. Discussion It is vital to assess the local needs of Chile based on its UGs, considering that FO is an underestimated resource that should be included early on in dental curriculums. Furthermore, it should align with public policies to ensure viability and inclusion in standardised protocols. Conclusion Although there is potential usage of UG dental students in DVI is not ideal, circumstances will dictate their use.

It is characterized by tissue fragility, joint hypermobility and a wide range of articular and non-articular manifestations, which often appear in infancy. The clinical picture of EDS-HT/JHS is poorly known by the medical community, as is the presence of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) problems in affected children. Aim: The present work reviews the clinical and empirical evidence for ESSENCE difficulties in children with EDS-HT/1E1S. Method: A narrative review of the literature was undertaken following a comprehensive search of scientific online databases and reference lists. This included publications of quantitative and qualitative research. Results: Motor abnormality, hyperactivity/hypoactivity, inattention, speech/language, social interaction, behavioral, sleep, feeding and emotional problems are ESSENCE difficulties for which there is some evidence of an association with EDS-HT/JHS. Conclusion: Children with EDS-HT/JHS present ESSENCE problems that often coexist and tend to be recognized before the HDCT. Clinicians encountering children with ESSENCE problems should consider the possibility of an underlying HDCT such as EDS-HT/JHS, probably influencing neurodevelopmental attributes in a subgroup of children. Awareness of these interconnected clinical problems might help improve early referral, diagnosis and treatment of EDS-HT/JHS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been conceptualized in this article using a framework depicting the affects of these shifts on learning environments that may change schooling and impact society. These trends provide new challenges for educational researchers at national and international levels, requiring attention to the interrelationships among the various components in an educational system. New evidence, which builds on earlier claims of an increasing digital divide between developing and developed countries, has shown that this phenomenon is much more complex than was previously thought. We suggest that a promising way to maximize the knowledge and impact of researching IT in education is to establish longitudinal programmatic research sustained through the establishment of E-learning observatories, which can bring together expertise across a range of disciplines. A major challenge in forming a clear and coherent strategy for researching IT in education lies in the fact that there are multiple stakeholders with differing aims, goals and objectives. Therefore, reciprocal relationships are needed in which practice informs research and research informs practice with support and guidance from policymakers.;"[Cox, M.

Students were compared with respect to their satisfaction with Center activities. Students experiencing instability in their lives, more often in larger cities, were least satisfied. The most successful activity was workshops discussing psychological and social issues.

In its commitment to provide education for all to age 18, Chile recently expanded its system of schools for teenage dropouts and has funded research on how best to educate these youth. This article, based on data from a national sample of 18 recently established Second Opportunity Centers, describes student characteristics, their ambitions for their education and future, and their evaluation of their experience to date. Using a review of principally North American research findings as a guide, the study analyzes factors linked with grade repetition and withdrawal from school to suggest strategies that may be effective in increasing retention of students.

In the first part of the article, central orientations in conceptualizing mathematics teacher knowledge are identified and the more serious limitations of the grounds on which they stand are explicated. In the second part of the article, alternative views are offered to each of these orientations that direct attention to underexplored issues about what makes mathematics teacher knowledge specialized. Collectively, these alternative views suggest that specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge cannot be comprehensively accounted for by what' teachers know, but rather by how' teachers' knowing comes into being. We conclude that it is not a kind of knowledge but a style of knowing that signifies specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge.;"[Scheiner, Thorsten] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Scheiner, Thorsten] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Scheiner, Thorsten] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Montes, Miguel A.; Carrillo, Jose] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain; [Godino, Juan D.] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Pino-Fan, Luis R.] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile";;"Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.; Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Scheiner, T (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.";t.scheiner@auckland.ac.nz;"Scheiner, Thorsten/AAC-5903-2019; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/AAF-3293-2021; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/AAF-8804-2020; Pino-Fan, Luis R./Q-5687-2019; Carrillo-Yañez, José/J-4854-2016; Montes, Miguel/J-6841-2014";"Scheiner, Thorsten/0000-0002-1118-5958; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/0000-0003-3181-0797; Navarro, Miguel Ángel Montes/0000-0003-3181-0797; Pino-Fan, Luis R./0000-0003-4060-7408; Carrillo-Yañez, José/0000-0001-7906-416X; Montes, Miguel/0000-0003-3181-0797";"Macquarie University; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150014];  [EDU2013-44047-P];  [EDU2016-74848-P]";Writing was done while the first author, Thorsten Scheiner, was a Klaus Murmann Fellow of the Foundation of German Business and completed while he was recipient of the Research Excellent Scholarship of Macquarie University.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional, competencies have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural bottlenecks in the educational and social system. Finally, the lessons learned after more than 15 years of implementing technology in Chilean schools are presented and fully discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A Course Management System (CMS), according to Social Constructivism framework, is an opportunity for fostering learning through interaction in a virtual environment for learning; hence, stimulating the use of a CMS for communication purposes seems quite appropriate. A quantitative analysis of 63.06% of the virtual classrooms was conducted, using the users log database to describe five variables: Participation, Informational Interaction Level, Communicational Interaction Level, and the use of Informational Resources and Communicational Resources in the CMS. An assessment of the first 2 years of implementation of Moodle in a campus confirmed prominence levels of interaction and resources that favor Information over Communication purposes in the use of the CMS. It is not conclusive whether this necessarily implies more or better learning; a profound qualitative study would be needed to answer these questions. Teachers and students show different behaviors in the face of this new ICT campus resource, while faculty members appear to have behaved in an erratic manner, students show steady levels of CMS usage.

However, their appearance and growth pathways have had significant disparities. Design/methodology/approach Global and local agendas have had a strong influence on Chilean higher education institutions. A relevant signal has been the creation of the SCN, formed by 21 Chilean universities, whose vision is to help shape a fair and environmentally healthy civilization contributing from the higher education realm. This work adopts a survey design methodological approach. It describes the following resulting components obtained from the aggregated data: (a) emergence processes and environments, (b) governance models and operational mechanisms, (c) networks and collaboration, and (d) final products generated, for sustainability governing entities within universities in Chile. Findings The main findings indicate that at the institutional level, the Cleaner Production Agreement for higher education institutions and the creation of the SCN have been key drivers in the formalization of several entities leading the sustainability efforts within Chilean universities. Also, regarding the degree of commitment to sustainability, the most active internal stakeholder corresponds to students. Originality/value The present work represents a pioneering effort in the Chilean context to identify and systematize the challenges, organizational structures, and key accomplishments of sustainability governing entities in higher education nationwide.;"[Mac-lean, Claudia; Aldea, Cristian] Univ Magallanes, GAIA Antarctic Res Ctr, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Vargas, Luis Santiago] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Vargas, Luis Santiago] Inst Sistemas Complejos Ingn ISCI, Santiago, Chile; [Uribe, Gonzalo] Univ Magallanes, Outreach, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Aldea, Cristian] Univ Magallanes, Dept Sci & Nat Resources, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Lares, Lorna] Univ Chile, Ind Design Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Mercado, Oscar] Metropolitan Technol Univ, Sustainabil Program, Santiago, Chile";;Mac-lean, C (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, GAIA Antarctic Res Ctr, Punta Arenas, Chile.;"clau.maclean.b@gmail.com; lvargasd@ing.uchile.cl; gonzalo.uribe@umag.cl; cristian.aldea@umag.cl; lolares@uchilefau.cl; omercado@utem.cl";vargas, luis/A-2109-2011;vargas, Luis/0000-0001-6539-1768;CONICYT PIA/BASALComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL [AFB180003];The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from CONICYT PIA/BASAL AFB180003.;;29;0;0;2;18;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1467-6370;1758-6739;;INT J SUST HIGHER ED;Int.

Three MSGs were developed and played by teams of four students in order to solve problems collaboratively. A quasi-experimental design was used. The data shows that the experimental group achieved a higher perception of their own collaboration skills and a higher score in the plan execution dimension of the problem solving cycle than did the non-equivalent control group, revealing that MSG-based learning activities may contribute to such learning improvements.

L'experience a ete reconnue et valorisee, sous certains aspects, par la politique experimentale du Ministere de l'Education de la Republique du Chili. La proposition educative dont rend compte cette experience a reussi a s'inserer dans un processus social de transformations plus globales: des enfants et adolescents qui vivaient dans des conditions de vulnerabilite ont accede peu a peu au systeme scolaire, parvenant meme, dans certains cas, a s'incorporer a l'education superieure. Pour reconstruire les evenements historiques, on a eu recours a l'histoire orale, a travers des entretiens avec cinq professeurs protagonistes de cette experience. L'analyse de l'experience permet de montrer que la categorie sujet enseignant' emerge de l'articulation de quatre dimensions interdependantes, a savoir: la communaute, la politique educative, les pairs et la salle de classe. On en conclut que, dans des conjonctures historiques determinees, les sujets enseignants' creent de nouvelles pratiques dans tous ces domaines, qui transforment le systeme educatif. La possibilite se manifeste alors de construire un systeme educatif comptant sur la participation de la communaute educative, incorporant la culture locale et coherente a un projet de transformation sociale nationale.

Using a conceptual history approach allowed us to analyse the meanings attributed to the concept of quality in the design and implementation of two evaluation systems: The Educational Quality Assessment System (SECE, Spanish initials) and the Educational Quality Measurement System (SIMCE, Spanish initials). The findings show a transformation in meaning for the concept of quality. It moved from the operationalisation, management, and improvement of school systems to equating quality with the results of educational evaluations. This new definition of quality resulted from decisions by the Chilean State, which simplified its complexity and helped manage the new school system. An implication of this semantic transformation is the understanding of quality as a tool used to rank schools.;"[Galioto, Carmelo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile; [Perez Navarro, Camila] Univ OHiggins, Inst Educ Sci, Rancagua, Chile";;Galioto, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile.;cgalioto@uc.cl;;;;;;76;0;0;3;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0030-9230;1477-674X;;PAEDAGOG HIST;Paedagog.

A meta-analysis was conducted of scientifically rigorous experiments comparing the learning outcomes (i.e., performance on memory and/or comprehension tests) of students (i.e., college students and/or K-12 students) who read an academic text with or without being asked to highlight important material (i.e., with or without learner-generated highlighting) or who read an academic text with or without the important material already being highlighted (i.e., with or without instructor-provided highlighting). We found 36 published articles that met these criteria ranging from the years 1938 to 2019, which generated 85 effect sizes. The results showed that learner-generated highlighting improved memory but not comprehension, with average effect sizes of 0.36 and 0.20, respectively; and instructor-provided highlighting improved both memory and comprehension, both with an average effect size of 0.44. Learner-generated highlighting improved learning for college students but not for school students, with average effect sizes of 0.39 and 0.24, respectively; and instructor-provided highlighting improved learning for both college and school students, with average effect sizes of 0.41 and 0.48, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to understand the factors associated with Chilean elementary and middle school students' perceptions of school safety. We used a sample of 5,455 students from low socioeconomic status public schools, and analyzed the predictive value of peer physical and verbal victimization; teacher and school staff victimization; teacher's social support; and perception of safety in the students' neighborhoods on perceptions of school safety. Findings showed that although different forms of school violence, particularly peer physical victimization and physical and sexual victimization from teachers and school staff, contribute to students' perception of school safety, the highest contribution came from students perceiving their neighborhoods as unsafe. In contrast, teacher social support contributed to increased levels of perceived school safety.

Indeed, curricula have already been developed that, through tailored support for peer argumentation. promote both content knowledge and argumentation skills simultaneously. However, we do not yet know how to optimize the occurrence of peer argumentation, although there are suggestions in the literature that computers may have a role to play. Likewise, there are uncertainties about the mechanisms through which the benefits of peer argumentation are achieved, especially whether (and how) there is interdependence across the two types of benefit. In this paper, we report a quasi-experimental study randomized at class level, which addresses these two issues. A total of 502 fourth-grade students and 20 classes and teachers covered a module in science under three conditions: (1) using a curriculum that was already known to promote peer argumentation and content knowledge (standard support). (2) using the same curriculum but with additional computer-based support (computer-enhanced support), and (3) a routinely taught control group. Students' argumentation skills and content knowledge were assessed. Content knowledge was assessed prior to and after the intervention, with immediate and delayed posttests. Multiple regression analyses showed that peer argumentation was indeed most frequent in the computer-enhanced condition. Moreover, on the basis of a multilevel path analysis, we found that individual contributions to peer argumentation had a direct effect on posttest argumentation skills and an indirect effect on posttest content knowledge, both immediate and delayed. The indirect effect of argumentation on delayed posttest content knowledge was mediated by immediate posttest knowledge and posttest argumentation skills.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Singer, Vivian; Moran, Camila; Sanchez, Alvaro; Silva, Maximiliano; Villavicencio, Constanza] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine; Silva, Maximiliano] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England; [Lopez, Patricia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pinochet, Jorge] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Dept Phys, Nunoa, Chile";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;;"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Pinochet, Jorge/0000-0002-5703-5699";Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA [ID14I10094, ID14I20094];This work was supported by Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA ID14I10094 and ID14I20094.

It has advantages over other previous works published since it is modular, flexible, interactive, easy to use, and the results are closer to the experimental ones because it takes into account real complex effects, such as: motor core saturation, parameter variations with the speed and temperature, sensor signal digital processing, and inverter real voltage waveforms. These results has been successfully applied in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses at the authors' universities for building, identification and characterization of diverse control schemes, analysis of parameter effects, and design and test of new controllers for field oriented control schemes in induction motors.

However, investigations of perceived stress amongst Spanish-speaking student groups are sparse. This study aimed to (i) describe the translation, adaptation and psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Dental Environment Stressors questionnaire and (ii) to examine the perceived sources of stress and their associations with the students' study year and gender in two dental schools in Latin America. Materials and methods All students officially registered in the dental schools of the University of San Sebastian (USS) in Chile and the Catholic University of Cordoba (CUC) in Argentina were invited to participate in the study. The DES30 questionnaire was adapted in Spanish using translation/back-translation, an expert bilingual committee, and consensus building. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the instrument's internal consistency, and iterated principal factor analysis with promax rotation was employed to explore its underlying factor structure. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate methods were used to examine the patterns of association between individual stressors, factor scores and students' characteristics. Results Three hundred and four students comprised the study's analytical sample, with two-thirds of those being female. The DES30-Sp demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's a similar to=similar to 0.89). A four-factor solution emerged and included academic workload, clinical training, time constraints and self-efficacy beliefs factors. Fear of failing a course or a year, examinations and grades and lack of time for relaxation were amongst the top individual-item stressors reported by students in both schools. Amongst this group of undergraduate dental students, those in Argentina, in higher study year, and females reported higher perceived stress. Conclusions Increased workload, time constraints and some aspects of clinical training were the top stressors of approximately 300 Chilean and Argentinean dental undergraduates. Some variations between schools, males and females and study years were noted. The Spanish version of the DES30 questionnaire performed well, but future studies should evaluate the instrument's properties in larger and more diverse dental student populations.;"[Fonseca, J.; Pizarro, S.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Divaris, K.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Villalba, S.] Catholic Univ Cordoba, Sch Dent, Dept Paediat Dent, Cordoba, Argentina; [Fernandez, M.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Concepcion, Chile; [Codjambassis, A.] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Grad Studies, Off Res & Grad Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Villa-Torres, L.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Polychronopoulou, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Community & Prevent Dent, Athens 11528, Greece";;Divaris, K (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, 228 Brauer Hall,CB 7450, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;divarisk@dentistry.unc.edu;"Divaris, Kimon/E-4706-2011; Divaris, Kimon/AAU-8735-2021";"Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Fernandez, Marcelo/0000-0002-6980-6219";;;;62;20;27;1;45;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

A comparative study in Latin America;COMUNICAR;;;Spanish;Article;;;;;;"Media literacy; digital skills; media competencies; teaching; educommunication; COVID-19";;The COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America forced a transition from a face-to-face educational model to a distance model affected by emergencies, technological precariousness, and lack of planning. This has heightened the need for media literacy in the region. In this context, the changes that have occurred were analyzed in order to propose a critical agenda from the perspective of teachers. First, a desk research of official sources was carried out to learn about the strategies of the four countries under study: Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Secondly, eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis. The results shed light on the need for relevant ICT training from a media literacy perspective, and strategies to address connectivity gaps, lack of adequate environments and work overload. The specific results per country and the differences and demands of each context are discussed in this work as contributions to the development of a critical agenda in media education.;"[Mateus, Julio-Cesar] Univ Lima, Fac Comunicac, Lima, Peru; [Andrada, Pablo] Univ La Serena, Dept Ciencias Sociales, La Serena, Chile; [Gonzalez-Cabrera, Catalina; Ugalde, Cecilia] Univ Azuay, Escuela Comunicac, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Novomisky, Sebastian] Univ Nacl La Plata, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina";;Mateus, JC (corresponding author), Univ Lima, Fac Comunicac, Lima, Peru.;"jmateus@ulima.edu.pe; pablo.andrada@userena.cl; cgonzalez@uazuay.edu.ec; cugalde@uazuay.edu.ec; sebastiann@perio.unlp.edu.ar";"Mateus, Julio-César/U-1475-2019; Ugalde, Cecilia/V-7396-2018; González-Cabrera, Catalina/N-8203-2019; González-Cabrera, Catalina/B-1145-2017";"Mateus, Julio-César/0000-0001-5161-3737; Ugalde, Cecilia/0000-0001-7716-6023; González-Cabrera, Catalina/0000-0002-1367-9337; González-Cabrera, Catalina/0000-0002-1367-9337; Andrada, Pablo/0000-0002-2887-5517";;;;48;1;1;8;8;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN;2022;30;70;;;;;9;19;;10.3916/C70-2022-01;;;11;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";XF7DJ;WOS:000724228000001;;Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Previous research has demonstrated that blogs foster development of EFL skills. This study, which takes a sociocultural approach, focuses on EFL interaction. Specifically, the study aims to identify the interaction strategies that bloggers employ by exploring both teacher-initiated and student-initiated interactions. An EFL undergraduate class at the University of Chile serves as the vantage point for discussion. Bloggers' posts and comments are thematically analysed for the purposes of this study. It is demonstrated that blogs promote EFL interaction, self-expression, self-evaluation, and a sense of language progress. The study may be of interest to educationists around the world who are interested in identifying how blogs can best be harnessed within foreign language education for the benefit of learners.;"[Trajtemberg, Claudia] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Yiakoumetti, Androula] Oxford Brookes Univ, Westminster Inst Educ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England";;Trajtemberg, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.;androula.yiakoumetti@cantab.net;;;;;;15;19;20;0;12;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0951-0893;1477-4526;;ELT J;ELT J.;OCT;2011;65;4;;;;;437;445;;10.1093/elt/ccr015;;;9;"Education & Educational Research; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics";"Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)";"Education & Educational Research; Linguistics";821QT;WOS:000294990200008;;;;;2022-04-06;

Infants (54% male) were studied at childhood (M-age=10years) and adolescence (M-age=14years). IDA in infancy was related to excessive alcohol use and risky sexual behavior in adolescence through its effect on poor emotion regulation in childhood.

Aim: The present study explored the relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma among caregivers of autistic children in Latin America. Additionally, explore contextual factors that better explain the perception of stigma when accessing services. Methods and Procedure: Approximately 2500 caregivers from six Latin American countries completed an online survey. Descriptive inferential analysis and a pointbiserial correlation were conducted to understand direct relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma and to test their relationship. Added contextual factors contributing to this relationship were examined through a binary logistic regression. Outcomes and Results: Barriers to accessing services predicted stigma. Contextual factors such as country of residence, frustration experienced by caregivers, gender of autistic child and challenging behaviours had higher odds of experiencing some form of perceived stigma. Conclusions and Implications: These results suggest experiences with stigma to be heavily influenced by environmental factors such cultural differences which in combination with contextual factors could further increase the likelihood of perceiving stigma. When observing stigma within a social-cognitive approach, it is possible that a strong-held adherence to cultural norms, in addition to negative experiences (e.g., frustration) when accessing services, could be influencing caregivers perceived stigma.;"[Montenegro, Maria Cecilia; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Abdul-Chani, Monica] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Psychol, 1720 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Valdez, Daniel] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales Sede Argentina F, Tucuman 1966,C1050 AAN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20,Torre AIRD,2do Piso, Santo Domingo 10109, Dominican Rep; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Av 18 Julio 1824, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA, Domingo Repetto 1145,CP B1640EMQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Presbiteriana Mackenzie UPM, Programa Posgrad Disturbios Desenvolvimento, Rua Consolacao 930, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Ave Libertador Bernardo Higgins 1058, Santiago 8330111, Chile";;Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), 1200 Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.;cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu;"Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022; paula, cristiane/D-8968-2017";"Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rattazzi, Alexia/0000-0001-7993-2123; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; paula, cristiane/0000-0003-0438-9407; Garrido Candela, Gabriela/0000-0001-8841-8425; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422";;;;69;0;0;2;2;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0891-4222;1873-3379;;RES DEV DISABIL;Res.

It assesses what PBL is, in terms of the range of definitions in use and in light of its origins in specific disciplines such as medicine. It considers experiences (if PBL from the standpoint of students, instructors and managers (e.g. deans), and asks how well stated this method of learning is for use in geography curricula, courses and assignments. It identifies some 'best practices in PBL', as well as some useful sources for those seeking to adopt PBL in geography. It concludes that PBL is not a teaching and learning method to be adopted lightly, and that if the chances of successful implementation are to be maximized, careful attention to course preparation and scenario design is essential. More needs to be known about the circumstances in which applications of PBL have not worked well and also about the nature of the inputs needed from students, teachers and others to real) its benefits.;"Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Christchurch, New Zealand; Samford Univ, Dept Geog, Birmingham, AL 35229 USA; Oxford Brookes Univ, Ctr Geog Higher Educ, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; Univ La Serena, Fac Cs Sociales & Econ, La Serena, Chile; Univ Auckland, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Geol, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada";;Pawson, E (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Geog, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand.;eric.pawson@canterbury.ac.nz;;;;;;66;111;112;3;29;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0309-8265;1466-1845;;J GEOGR HIGHER EDUC;J.

The software is integrated with two commercial finite element softwares. These are the Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) code in SAP2000 and the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) code in ANSYS. GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental knowledge for their future works as engineers. The present interactive virtual environment has great potential to improve the learning process of the analysis of silo structures.;"[Garcia-Macias, Enrique] Univ Perugia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Via G Duranti 93, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Castro-Triguero, Rafael] Univ Cordoba, Dept Mech, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba, Spain; [Saavedra Flores, Erick I.; Yanez, Sergio J.; Hinrechsen, Karen] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ingn Obras Civiles, Ave Ecuador 3659, Santiago 9160000, Chile";;Flores, EIS (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ingn Obras Civiles, Ave Ecuador 3659, Santiago 9160000, Chile.;erick.saavedra@usach.cl;"Yanez, Sergio/Q-7165-2019; García-Macías, Enrique/L-2005-2015; Triguero, Rafael Castro/N-5054-2019";"Yanez, Sergio/0000-0002-8856-0955; García-Macías, Enrique/0000-0001-5557-144X; Triguero, Rafael Castro/0000-0002-2937-1118";;;;35;2;2;1;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

The aim was to identify cultural factors relevant to breast and cervical cancer screening, develop an instrument to assess them and examine its preliminary psychometric properties among Latin American (Latino) and non-Latino White (Anglo) women in Southern California. Seventy-eight Latino and Anglo women participated in semi-structured interviews, which were content coded based on Triandis' methods for the analysis of subjective culture. Based on the emerging cultural elements, items relevant to cancer screening were developed and pilot tested with 161 participants. After the instrument was refined, 314 Latino and Anglo women from various socioeconomic backgrounds completed the CCSS and data were factor analyzed resulting in five cultural factors: cancer screening fatalism, negative beliefs about health professionals, catastrophic disease expectations, symptomatic deterrents and sociocultural deterrents. The instrument demonstrated measurement equivalence, adequate reliability and predictive validity. The research and the CCSS are discussed in terms of implications for the study of culture in relation to health disparities and the development of evidence-based interventions with culturally diverse populations and their health professionals.;"[Betancourt, Hector; Flynn, Patricia M.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA; [Betancourt, Hector] Univ La Frontera, Dept Psychol, Temuco, Chile; [Riggs, Matt] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Psychol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Garberoglio, Carlos] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Dept Gen & Oncol Surg, Duarte, CA 91010 USA";;Betancourt, H (corresponding author), Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA.;hbetancourt@llu.edu;;;NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R21CA101867] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER;;;48;36;41;0;11;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1153;1465-3648;;HEALTH EDUC RES;Health Educ.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is philosophical, conceptual and theoretical and in proffering a bold thesis, has an argumentative character appropriate to that style. Findings Three stages can be identified over the past 200 years in the relationship between the university and the matter of social responsibility, being successively tacit, weak and now hybrid. In the present stage, new spaces are opening for the university to transcend social responsibility, moving to a worldly and earthly responsibility. However, this new stage is having to contend against the university in an age of cognitive capitalism. As such, a large but hitherto unnoticed culture war is present, the outcome of which is unclear. Research limitations/implications The scholarship informing this paper is wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary (history, social theory, philosophy, critical higher education studies, literature on the idea of the university, comparative higher education, ethics and sociology of knowledge), as it has to be in sustaining the large thesis being contended for, and it has broad hinterlands, which can only lightly be intimated. Practical implications The key implication is that the idea of social responsibility is currently being construed too narrowly and that, therefore, universities - in developing their corporate strategies and missions - should be more ambitious and set their responsibility goals against horizons that go well beyond the social realm. Originality/value The thesis developed here is original in offering a three-stage theory of a 200-year evolution of the socially responsible European university. A new stage of an Earthly responsibility is glimpsed but it is having to contend with a continuing performative university, so leading to a hidden culture war and such that the future of university social responsibility is in doubt.;"[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile";;Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, London, England.;"ron.barnett@ucl.ac.uk; carolina.guzman.uta@gmail.com";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;Fondecyt projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1200633];This work was supported by Fondecyt project 1200633.;;57;1;1;1;3;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1467-6370;1758-6739;;INT J SUST HIGHER ED;Int.

The central hypothesis of this work is that students attending schools with high digital development have higher levels of subjective well-being. To test this hypothesis, two quantitative empirical studies carried out in Chile are used as sources of information. The first one is the 2013 National Survey of School Well-being, applied to 15-year-old students (4964 cases) from 191 schools, and the second one is the 2012 National Census of Educational Computing. Subsequently, after both sources are merged, a descriptive analysis and an explanatory model are created based on the dependent variable Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and the independent variables School Digital Development Index (SDDI) and attributes of establishment and subjects. Among the results, the finding of a positive and significant relationship between school digital development and higher subjective well-being scores of students stands out.;"[Donoso, Gonzalo; Casas, Ferran; Lopez, Mauricio] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Donoso, Gonzalo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Innovat Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Casas, Ferran] Univ Andres Bello, Programa Doctorado Educ & Sociedad, Santiago, Chile; [Carlos Oyanedel, Juan] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Mauricio] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Expt Social Sci, Santiago, Chile";;Donoso, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Innovat Ctr Anacleto Angelini, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.;"gmdonoso@uc.cl; ferran.casas@udg.edu; juan.oyanedel@unab.cl; mauricio.lopez@usach.cl";;"Lopez-Tapia, Mauricio/0000-0003-4459-2768; Oyanedel, Juan/0000-0003-4023-6926";"PIA CONICYT project [CIE 160009]; FONDECYT Regular projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181533]";This work was made possible thanks to the funding granted by the CIE 160009 PIA CONICYT and FONDECYT Regular 1181533 projects.

Sixth-grade students selected from four schools located in Santiago, Chile read a two-paragraph text on a computer screen and were asked either to read it (read-only group), highlight text as they read (highlighting group), type notes from the text into a textbox as they read (notetaking group), fill in an interactive graphic organizer (graphic organizer group), highlight first and then take notes from the text (highlighting + notetaking group) or highlight first and then fill in an interactive graphic organizer (highlighting + graphic organizer group). The graphic organizer group, highlighting + graphic organizer group, and highlighting + notetaking group each made significantly more integrative eye movements between the two paragraphs during learning (indicating better learning processes) and produced higher comprehension test scores (indicating better learning outcomes) as compared to the read-only group, whereas the highlighting group and notetaking group did not. Results are consistent with the idea that filling in graphic organizers is a generative learning strategy, whereas highlighting and typing notes into a textbox are not generative learning strategies. Similarly using two learning strategies together (notetaking and highlighting) leads to generative learning even though using either one of those strategies alone does not, so in this case two learning strategies are better than one.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Soledad Loyola, Maria; Mendez, Ester E.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Lab Tecnol Interact, VirtuaLab, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Ingn Ind, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.;"hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; maria.loyola.f@usach.cl; mario.lopez@usach.cl; ester.mendez@usach.cl";Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";"CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT [1151092]; Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile";This study was partially funded by CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT #1151092 and Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile.;;41;10;10;7;50;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

We examined whether the current allocation of time to physical activity among young people leads to outcomes that may affect their well being as youth and their longer-term life prospects. Design: The study group comprised a random sample of 1692 high-school students (14.8 +/- 0.7 years old) from urban Santiago, Chile attending private and non-private schools. Setting: We measured physical activity habits accounting for time spent in class, studying and screen-based entertainment, hours of daily recreational activity and hours of weekly scheduled exercise. Obesity and abdominal obesity were diagnosed according to CDC/NCHS 2000, NHANES III and IDF criteria, respectively. Method: Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between current physical activity habits, confounders and the likelihood of suffering from obesity and abdominal obesity. Results: Young people reporting the lowest allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play showed a higher risk of obesity and abdominal obesity. Those reporting moderate allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play were more likely to suffer from central obesity as defined by IDF criteria. Study participants attending partially subsidized schools showed the highest risk of obesity and central obesity. Conclusions: In this sample, young people appear not to be employing optimal strategies for making weight-related choices, since reduced physical activity, obesity and central obesity are proximate causes of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.;"[Correa-Burrows, Paulina] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ Publ Finance 2, Madrid, Spain; [Burrows, Raquel A.] Univ Chile, Inst Nutr & Food Technol, Santiago, Chile";;Correa-Burrows, P (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ URJC, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Vicalvaro,P Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.;paulina.correa.burrows@urjc.es;"Burrows, Raquel/A-8489-2015; Burrows, Raquel/AAF-5660-2019; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/O-7436-2014";"Burrows, Raquel/0000-0001-9155-0689; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/0000-0002-6177-1162";;;;26;2;2;0;12;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0017-8969;1748-8176;;HEALTH EDUC J;Health Educ.

Education systems have a role to play in this, especially given the growing evidence of a digital divide. Through this study, we look to identify and characterize factors related to the digital skills of 10th grade Chilean students, as measured by a national standardized test. A mixed methodology was used to explore these factors and provide a more detailed analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a Hierarchical Linear Model to determine which factors explain student performance on the test. In addition to this, a qualitative analysis was also carried out using an exploratory case study. The purpose of this case study was to take a more in-depth look at the characteristics of high and low-performing students on the digital skills test. This was done by analyzing their activities, perceptions and motivations when using technology. The quantitative results revealed that the most important factors in developing digital skills are having access to a computer at home, linguistic capital, socioeconomic status, and years of experience using a computer. The qualitative study also revealed that students who scored highly on the test were generally able to focus and concentrate on their school assignments when using the Internet. These students also adopted cognitive and organizational strategies in order to be more effective. Our findings should be further investigated in order to support the design of school activities that aim to develop students' digital skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This research presents the educational, quantitative, and qualitative evaluation of an Augmented Reality and Mobile Pedestrian Navigation app. The software was designed for mobile learning in an educational context, to evaluate its effectiveness when applied as a teaching tool, in comparison to similar tools such as those present in e-learning. A mixed-method analysis was used, with primary school students from Chile as subjects (n = 143). They were split into one control group and one experimental group. The control group worked in an e-learning environment, while the experimental group performed the activity as field work, making use of the app (m-learning). Students were evaluated pretest and posttest using an objective test to measure their level of learning. In parallel, a satisfaction survey was carried out concerning the use of these technologies, in addition to interviews with several students and teachers of the experimental group. Pretest-posttest results indicate that the experimental group outperformed the control group in their learning levels. The results of the interviews and the satisfaction survey show that these technologies, combined with fieldwork, increase the effectiveness of the teaching-learning processes. Further, they promote the interaction of students with contents for learning, and they improve students' performance in the educational process. The main goal is to provide a methodology for the analysis of an ad-hoc designed app. The app is intended to provide an m-learning process for subjects being taught about cultural heritage. The quantitative and qualitative results obtained show that it can be more effective than using similar technologies in e-learning contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most important problems of pedagogical software is to establish a common language between the knowledge areas involved in their development, basically pedagogical, computing and domain areas. A mathematical model, like the one proposed here, can facilitate the integration of these different areas, as it defines the elements that constitute the system and defines the technological tools to implement it. The article presents an example demonstrating how the formalization was used to design the adaptive mechanism of an ITS to adapt its Interface Module to some student characteristics.

In e-PELS, students learn to highlight and outline expository passages based on various types of text structures (such as comparison or cause-and-effect) as well as to paraphrase, self-question, and summarize. The study involved 1041 fourth-grade elementary students from 21 schools distributed in three regions in central Chile. Participant teachers integrated this program into the Spanish language curriculum, instructing their students during thirty sessions of 90 min each during one school semester. Pretest-to-posttest gains in reading comprehension scores were significantly greater for students instructed with this program than for students who received traditional instruction (d = .5), with particularly strong effects for lower-achieving students (d = .7). The findings support the efficacy of direct instruction in specific learning strategies in a computer-based environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a significantly different model of educational software that was derived from a case study of two teachers participating in a software design process. It shows the relationship between particular elements of the teachers' pedagogy and the characteristics of the software design. In this model, the 'classroom atmosphere' is embedded in the human-computer interface scenarios and elements, the 'teaching strategy' in the design of the browsing strategies of the software, and the 'learning strategy' in the particular forms of interaction with the software. The model demonstrates significant links between the study of Pedagogy and the study of Information Technology in Education and has implications for the relationship between those two areas of research and consequently for teacher training, The model proposes a perspective on educational software design that takes into consideration not only learning theories, but also teaching theories and practice.

The proposals and experiences of the Society for the Construction of Educational Facilities (1937-1987) in Chile and the Board of Constructions for Technical and Secondary Education (1934-1969) in Portugal are analysed. Established in the 1930s, these centralised bodies managed, organised, and controlled state school building projects in such a way as to achieve uniformity in design, creating architectural identities that embodied both the educational values and the representative character of the State. These bodies were influenced by similar global circumstances, and their activities were guided by the recommendations issued by intergovernmental organisations of the time. Such a situation brought their projects closer together in terms of their functional, aesthetic, technical-constructive characteristics. After examining and identifying the international influences which brought them closer in terms of the educational meanings and values associated with school architecture, the paper identifies the local circumstances that guided the design and construction processes of schools in both countries, bringing fresh geographical insights to school architecture discussion. At the same time, possible global readings of strategies, influences and results are explored, enabling us to understand school architecture as part of a nation's cultural values and as a material expression of the social model of modernity, which will continue to meet the challenges that schools face in twenty-first-century society.;"[Gilles, Claudia Torres] Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile; [Alegre, Alexandra] Univ Lisbon, CITUA, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal";;Gilles, CT (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile.;claudiatorres@uchilefau.cl;"Alegre, Alexandra/AAC-4817-2020; Torres Gilles, Claudia/J-4083-2015";"Alegre, Alexandra/0000-0002-7280-5073; Torres Gilles, Claudia/0000-0002-5577-1385";"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014]";"This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014].";;46;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0030-9230;1477-674X;;PAEDAGOG HIST;Paedagog.

The purpose of this study is to present recent research on organizational change processes in universities. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach applied corresponds to the social issue maturation framework, to identify, describe and assess patterns of change across higher education institutions. The maturation of sustainability in universities can be divided into four stages: emergence, popularization, formalization and maturity. Findings The findings indicate that sustainability processes often begin as ad hoc processes which grow and mature over time as a range of different actors join in. However, sustainability in universities is increasingly connected with sustainability in the private sector and with other public actors. Moreover, there is a growing acknowledgement of the interactions between society, industry and academia. Originality/value The value of the paper is to provide a critical assessment of the potential of living lab projects initiated in Belgium (Brussels) and Chile (Santiago de Chile) to anchor sustainability firmly both in the functioning of the university and in the interactions with the neighborhood. The authors reflect on the requirements and the implementation of these initiatives as a strong indication of mature sustainability integration in, and by way of, universities.;"[Vargas, Luis] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Mac-Lean, Claudia] Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Huge, Jean] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Syst Ecol & Resource Management Unit, Brussels, Belgium";;Mac-Lean, C (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile.;clau.maclean.b@gmail.com;vargas, luis/A-2109-2011;"vargas, Luis/0000-0001-6539-1768; Huge, Jean/0000-0002-3695-547X";"Complex Engineering Systems Institute, ISCI [CONICYT: FB0816]; VLIR-UOS; ARES";L.

However, the social sciences, especially in Latin America, have only lately become interested in the subject and their approach is still vague. Scientific understanding of global environmental change and the process of designing public policies to face them are characterized by their complexity as well as by epistemic and normative uncertainties. This makes it necessary to problematize the way in which research efforts understand 'the social' of climate change. How do 'the climate' and 'the social' interpenetrate as scientific objects? What does the resulting field look like? Is the combination capable of promoting reflexivity and collaboration on the issue, or does it merely become dispersed with diffuse boundaries? Our paper seeks to answer these and other related questions using Chile as a case study and examining peer-reviewed scientific research on the topic. By combining in-depth qualitative content analysis of each paper with a statistical meta-analysis, we were able to: characterize the key content and forms of such literature; identify divisions and patterns within it; and, discuss some factors and trends that may help explain these. We conclude that the literature displays two competing trends: while it is inclined to become fragmented beyond the scope of the 'mitigation' black box, it also tends to cluster along the lines of methodological distinctions traditionally contested within the social sciences. This, in turn, highlights the persistence of disciplinary divisions within an allegedly interdisciplinary field.";"[Billi, Marco; Blanco, Gustavo; Urquiza, Anahi] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas Latitu, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Urquiza, Anahi] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Av Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;"Billi, M (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.";mbilli@alumnos.uai.cl;"Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/N-8046-2019; Billi, Marco/ABG-2953-2020; Urquiza, Anahí/P-8822-2019";"Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/0000-0002-4980-3424; Urquiza, Anahí/0000-0001-6901-0846; Billi, Marco/0000-0003-3161-6468";"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project [15110009, 15150003]; National PhD Scholarship (Chile) [CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160857, 11180824]; Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile) [NS130017]";"This work has received funding provided by the following institutional grants: Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15110009 (all authors); National PhD Scholarship (Chile) No. CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15150003 (Gustavo Blanco); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 1160857 (Gustavo Blanco); Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile), Project No. NS130017 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 11180824 (Anahi Urquiza).";;73;5;5;1;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0026-4695;1573-1871;;MINERVA;Minerva;SEP;2019;57;3;;;;;293;315;;10.1007/s11024-019-09369-2;;;23;"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics";IW5KO;WOS:000485017600002;;hybrid;;;2022-04-06;

However, little is known about what students have learned about NOSI during their pre-college school years. The purpose of this large-scale follow-up international project (i.e. 32 countries and regions, spanning six continents and including 3917 students for the high school sample) was to collect data on what exiting high school students have learned about NOSI. Additionally, the study investigated changes in 12th grade students' NOSI understandings compared to seventh grade (i.e. 20 countries and regions) students' understandings from a prior investigation [Lederman et al. (2019). An international collaborative investigation of beginning seventh grade students' understandings of scientific inquiry: Establishing a baseline.

This study documents and discusses graduating high school students' understandings and compares their understandings to seventh grade students' understandings of the same aspects of scientific inquiry for each country. It is important to note that collecting data from each of the 130+ countries globally was not feasible. Similarly, it was not possible to collect data from every region of each country. A concerted effort was made, however, to provide a relatively representative picture of each country and the world.;"[Lederman, J. S.; Lederman, N.

This depletion effect can be incorporated into cognitive load theory that is concerned with using the properties of human cognitive architecture, especially working memory, when designing instruction. Two experiments were carried out on the spacing effect that occurs when learning that is spaced by temporal gaps between learning episodes is superior to identical, massed learning with no gaps between learning episodes. Using primary school students learning mathematics, it was found that students obtained lower scores on a working memory capacity test (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher ratings of cognitive load (Experiment 2) after massed than after spaced practice. The reduction in working memory capacity may be attributed to working memory resource depletion following the relatively prolonged mental effort associated with massed compared to spaced practice. An expansion of cognitive load theory to incorporate working memory resource depletion along with instructional design implications, including the spacing effect, is discussed.;"[Chen, Ouhao; Sweller, John] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Chen, Ouhao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Early Start Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;"Chen, OH; Sweller, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Chen, OH (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.";"chenouhao_lucky@126.com; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; paas@fsw.eur.nl; j.sweller@unsw.edu.au";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Chen, Ouhao/0000-0001-9645-1946";"CONICYT PAI [82140021]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";"The second author acknowledges partial funding from CONICYT PAI, national funding research program for returning researchers from abroad, 2014, No 82140021; and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB0003.";;30;51;52;8;38;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test hypotheses from diverse theories predicting the effects of these agents' characteristics. We tested predictions of cognitive load theory, cognitive theory of multimedia learning, computers are social actors, social agency theory, uncanny valley, and the action observation network. Our meta-analysis of 32 effect sizes (N = 2104) revealed a small overall effect (g+ = 0.20), showing that learning with multimedia pedagogical agents was more effective than learning without these agents. As predicted by the redundancy effect of cognitive load theory and the coherence principle of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, 2D agents (g+ = 0.38) tended to be more effective than 3D agents (g+ = 0.11). As predicted by the computers are social actors hypothesis, most of the agents' characteristics, including nonverbal communication, motion, and voice, appeared not to moderate their effectiveness.

In this review article we focus on five of these strategies or solutions to problematic instructional designs in multimedia learning: (a) the multimedia principle (use visualizations and drawings to complement texts); (b) the split-attention effect or spatial contiguity principle (show texts contiguously or integrated with visualizations); (c) the redundancy effect, alike the coherence principle (remove nonessential learning information); (d) the signaling principle (cue or signal essential learning information); and (e) the transient information effect or segmenting principle (segment or control the pace of animations and videos). Usually, both cognitive theories have investigated solutions that instructors, teachers, and designers should pursue to optimize students' learning. Here, in a novel approach, we show that these strategies can also be used by learners who want to self-manage their cognitive load and learning process. We provide several examples of both instructor- and learner-managed solutions aligned with these strategies. When assessing which agent, either the instructor or the learner, was most effective, we observed mixed results in the literature. However, the expertise reversal effect may help predict the direction of these effects: novice students may learn better under instructor-managed conditions, whereas more expert students may learn more under learner-managed conditions.";"[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [de Koning, Bjorn B.; Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fiorella, Logan] Univ Georgia, Dept Educ Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; b.b.dekoning@essb.eur.nl; lfiorella@uga.edu; paas@essb.eur.nl";;Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]";Funding from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255 is gratefully acknowledged.;;168;6;6;27;38;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

Methodologically, these studies have addressed human vocalisation at an individual level. In the present study, we asked whether patterns such as musical intervals can also be found among the voices of people engaging in a conversation as an emerging interpersonal phenomenon. Fifty-six participants were randomly paired and assigned to either a control or a low-trust condition. Frequency ratios were generated by juxtaposing nonlocal fundamental frequency (f0) productions from two people engaged in each given dyadic conversation. Differences were found among conditions, both in terms of interval distribution and precision. These results support the idea that psychological dispositions modulate the musical intervals generated between participants through mutual real-time vocal accommodation. They also underscore the inter-domain use of musical intervals.;"[Robledo, Juan P.; Hurtado, Esteban; Prado, Felipe; Cornejo, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Language Interact & Phenomenol Lab LIF, Santiago, Chile; [Hurtado, Esteban] Univ Diego Portales, UDP INECO Fdn Core Neurosci UIFCoN, Lab Cognit & Social Neurosci, Santiago, Chile; [Roman, Domingo] Univ Santiago Chile, Humanities Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Robledo, Juan P.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Mus, Ctr Mus & Sci, Cambridge, England";;Robledo, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England.;jper2@cam.ac.uk;Cornejo, Carlos/Q-6871-2017;"Cornejo, Carlos/0000-0001-5426-0025; Prado, Felipe/0000-0003-3257-9646";Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [1100863];Ethical approval for this project was given by the Ethical Committee of the Psychology Department of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile as well as by the Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [Grant 1100863].;;52;1;1;0;7;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0305-7356;1741-3087;;PSYCHOL MUSIC;Psychol.

In turn, the perceived importance of environmental sustainability within higher education is growing at a rapid rate. This paper provides a summary of key elements as they apply to dentistry, and provides an introduction to the reader of an early consensus of how sustainability could be included as part of the dental curriculum. Methods The consensus opinion within this paper largely centres around discussion at the ADEE sustainability workshop at the annual conference in Berlin (August 2019). In order to help inform discussions at the workshop, a brief scoping questionnaire was circulated to potential participants regarding their understanding and current teaching practices in sustainability. An infographic was designed to help delegates remember the important elements of sustainable dentistry. Delegates discussed the concept of sustainability alongside the infographic, and how they could link these with the Graduating European Dentist (GED) curriculum. Results The discussions within the workshop largely centred around 4 main themes: Disease prevention and health promotion, Patient education and empowerment, Lean service delivery and Preferential use of strategies with lower environmental impact. Discussion It is apparent that there is a widespread need for teaching materials relating to environmental sustainability; this includes specific learning outcomes relating to the 4 educational domains of the Graduating European Dentist curriculum, and methods for teaching and assessing these outcomes.

Participants: 1,212 students from the Universidad de La Frontera, Chile (mean age 18.7 +/- 2.15) were surveyed in January-March 2018. Methods: Participants completed a cross-sectional self-report survey to evaluate QOL using the WHOQOL-BREF scale and eating habits with a food habits survey. Results: Students reporting a better healthy eating habits score also presented a higher QOL. Eating breakfast and eating home-cooked meals is a protective factor for QOL in each domain. The consumption of sweet snacks was shown to be a risk factor for the physical health and environment domains. The consumption of fast food is shown as the greatest risk factor in the physical domain. Conclusion: Healthy and unhealthy eating habits are associated with different dimensions of QOL. University authorities should develop new policies to improve the QOL of the entire university community.;"[Lanuza, Fabian] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Pediat & Cirugia Infantil, Temuco, Chile; [Lanuza, Fabian; Morales, Gladys; Balboa-Castillo, Teresa; Ortiz, Manuel S.; Munoz, Sergio] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Invest Epidemiol Cardiovasc & Nutr EPICYN, Temuco, Chile; [Lanuza, Fabian] Univ Barcelona, Fac Pharm & Food Sci, Inst Salud Carlos III,Dept Nutr,Food Sci & Gastro, Biomarkers & Nutrimetabol Lab,CIBER Fragilidad &, Barcelona, Spain; [Morales, Gladys; Balboa-Castillo, Teresa; Munoz, Sergio] Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Salud Publ, Francisco Salazar POB 54-D, Temuco 4811230, Chile; [Hidalgo-Rasmussen, Carlos] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Invest Riesgos & Calidad Vida CIRCAV, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Hidalgo-Rasmussen, Carlos] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Ortiz, Manuel S.] Univ La Frontera, Fac Educac Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Dept Psicol, Temuco, Chile; [Belmar, Carlos] Univ La Frontera, Direcc Desarrollo Estudiantil, Temuco, Chile";;Morales, G (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Fac Med, Dept Salud Publ, Francisco Salazar POB 54-D, Temuco 4811230, Chile.;gladys.morales@ufrontera.cl;Ortiz, Manuel/G-1044-2019;"Ortiz, Manuel/0000-0002-7749-0699; Munoz, Sergio/0000-0001-8383-6599; Lanuza, Fabian/0000-0001-8545-9301; Hidalgo-Rasmussen, Carlos Alejandro/0000-0002-5287-2076; Morales, Gladys/0000-0001-7194-8833";Universidad de La Frontera [IAF 17-0009];This research was supported and funded by Universidad de La Frontera (Project IAF 17-0009).;;49;2;2;3;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0744-8481;1940-3208;;J AM COLL HEALTH;J.

This problem is present not only in instructional pictures concerning the curricular topics (e.g., science, technology, engineering and mathematics: STEM), but also in those depicting extracurricular tasks (e.g., human movement tasks). When factors such as appeal, media, realism, size, and interaction are not tightly controlled between statics and animations, researchers may often be comparing apples with oranges. In this review, we provide a categorization of these confounding variables and offer some possible solutions to generate more tightly controlled studies. Future research could consider these biases and solutions, in order to design more equivalent visualizations. As a result, more conclusive evidence could be obtained identifying the boundary conditions for when static or dynamic images are more suitable for educational purposes, across both curricular and extracurricular tasks.

Consequently, when learning from dynamic pictures, students must process in working memory the current images while trying to remember the images that left the screen. This additional activity in working memory may lead dynamic pictures to be less suitable instructional materials than comparable static pictures, which are more permanent. In order to directly show the influence of transient visual information on dynamic learning environments, we designed a well-matched comparison between a permanent and a transient presentation of an abstract-symbol memory task on the computer. In the task, 104 university students (50% females) had to memorize the type, color, and position of the symbols in a rectangular configuration. In addition, an embodied cognition factor was included where the symbols in the task were either shown with a precision grasping static hand or not. We also assessed how individual characteristics (spatial ability, spatial memory span, and gender) influenced performance. Results showed that (a) permanent outperformed transient presentations, (b) observing hands hindered learning, and (c) high spatial ability and high spatial memory span were beneficial, but gender did not affect performance.

In order to produce a working document for the dental educator, this paper focuses on those methods where IT can assist in the education and competence development of dental students and dentists (e.g. e-learning, distance learning, simulations and computer-based assessment). Web pages and other information-gathering devices have become an essential part of our daily life, as they provide extensive information on all aspects of our society. This is mirrored in dental education where there are many different tools available, as listed in this report. IT offers added value to traditional teaching methods and examples are provided. In spite of the continuing debate on the learning effectiveness of e-learning applications, students request such approaches as an adjunct to the traditional delivery of learning materials. Faculty require support to enable them to effectively use the technology to the benefit of their students. This support should be provided by the institution and it is suggested that, where possible, institutions should appoint an e-learning champion with good interpersonal skills to support and encourage faculty change. From a global prospective, all students and faculty should have access to e-learning tools. This report encourages open access to e-learning material, platforms and programs. The quality of such learning materials must have well defined learning objectives and involve peer review to ensure content validity, accuracy, currency, the use of evidence-based data and the use of best practices. To ensure that the developers' intellectual rights are protected, the original content needs to be secure from unauthorized changes. Strategies and recommendations on how to improve the quality of e-learning are outlined. In the area of assessment, traditional examination schemes can be enriched by IT, whilst the Internet can provide many innovative approaches. Future trends in IT will evolve around improved uptake and access facilitated by the technology (hardware and software). The use of Web 2.0 shows considerable promise and this may have implications on a global level. For example, the one-laptop-per-child project is the best example of what Web 2.0 can do: minimal use of hardware to maximize use of the Internet structure. In essence, simple technology can overcome many of the barriers to learning. IT will always remain exciting, as it is always changing and the users, whether dental students, educators or patients are like chameleons adapting to the ever-changing landscape.;"[Mattheos, N.; Attstrom, R.] Malmo Univ Hosp, Ctr Oral Hlth Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Mattheos, N.] Univ Bern, Sch Dent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Stefanovic, N.] Univ Belgrade, Fac Stomatol, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Apse, P.; Care, R.] Riga Stradina Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Buchanan, J.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Brown, P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Camilleri, A.] Univ Malta, Fac Dent Surg, Msida, Malta; [Fabrikant, E.] Moscow State Univ Med & Dent, Moscow, Russia; [Gundersen, S.] Univ Oslo, Fac Dent, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Honkala, S.] Finnish Dent Soc Apollonia, Helsinki, Finland; [Johnson, L.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jonas, I.] Univ Dent Sch, Freiburg, Germany; [Kavadella, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Athens, Greece; [Moreira, J.] Inst Super Ciencias Dentarias, Oporto, Portugal; [Peroz, I.; Seemann, R.] Charite, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Perryer, D.

Three of the four main subscales (all but interpersonal) had acceptable reliability indices. In addition, although the impact of the Positive Impression subscale on responses to the main scales was generally low, the effect is not ignorable, and its impact should be modeled in further investigations of the EQ-i: YV-S. Finally, four main subscales of EQ-i: YV-S showed significant power in the prediction of general self-concept and moderate temporal stability.

This concern has increased the study of the phenomena, which has resulted in many scientific publications. Mobbing has been characterised as an emerging risk at work. The aim of this longitudinal study was to analyse the influence of mobbing on depressive symptoms in a sample of employees working with people with intellectual disabilities (ID). MethodThe sample consisted of 372 Spanish employees working with people with ID at 61 job centres in the Valencian Community (Spain). Seventy-nine (21.2%) participants were men, and 293 were (78.8%) women. Mobbing was evaluated by the Mobbing-UNIPSICO scale, and depressive symptoms were measured using the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale. Using analyses of variance (anova), we tested the differences in depressive symptoms according to the mobbing criteria indicated by Leymann, that is, frequency and duration at Time 1 and Time 2. ResultsEmployees who met the mobbing criteria: frequency (at least once a week) and duration (at least 6 months) at the two study times presented significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than employees who met mobbing criteria at Time 1, but did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 2, and employees who did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 1 or Time 2. ConclusionsWe conclude that permanence of mobbing from Time 1 to Time 2 increases depressive symptoms.;"[Figueiredo-Ferraz, H.; Gil-Monte, P.

In this work, we investigated whether gender imbalance in the participant samples of these studies may have contributed to the mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized experiments in which groups of students learning through dynamic visualizations were compared to groups receiving static visualizations. Our sample focused on tasks that could be categorized as either biologically secondary tasks (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics: STEM) or biologically primary tasks (manipulative-procedural). The meta-analysis of 46 studies (82 effect sizes and 5474 participants) revealed an overall small-sized effect (g+=0.23) showing that dynamic visualizations were more effective than static visualizations. Regarding potential moderators, we observed that gender was influential: the dynamic visualizations were more effective on samples with less females and more males (g+=0.36). We also observed that educational level, learning domain, media compared, and reporting reliability measures moderated the results. We concluded that because many visualization studies have used samples with a gender imbalance, this may be a significant factor in explaining why instructional dynamic and static visualizations seem to vary in their effectiveness. Our findings also support considering the gender variable in research about cognitive load theory and instructional visualizations.;"[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Wong, Mona] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ayres, Paul] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ, Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; wpsmona@hku.hk; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu; p.ayres@unsw.edu.au; paas@essb.eur.nl";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Wong, Mona/R-9026-2019";"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Wong, Mona/0000-0002-5595-6371";PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003];Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.;;108;28;28;1;16;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1040-726X;1573-336X;;EDUC PSYCHOL REV;Educ.

However, very little is hitherto known about the effects of these processes on specific situated communities. Through a multi-method approach (bibliometrics and interviews), we provide a nuanced description of these effects on the becoming of university-based sociology in Valparaiso, Chile, during the last fifteen or so years. The paper pays special attention to the emergence of a particular form of internationalization based on international indexes and rankings that has gained influence on the day-to-day practices of the scholarly communities in that part of the scholarly (semi-)periphery. We thoroughly described the entanglements of individual trajectories and institutional framings in the practices and discourses of sociologists in Valparaiso. The article concludes by highlighting the tensions arising from the encounter of traditions and some trade-offs of the current form of internationalization for (semi-)peripheral communities.;"[Koch, Tomas; Ayala, Ricardo A.] Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, Korte Meer 3-5, B-9000 Ghent, Flanders, Belgium; [Koch, Tomas] Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Sociol, Avda Playa Ancha 850, Valparaiso, Chile; [Blanco-Wells, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Ayala, Ricardo A.] Res Fdn Flanders, Brussels, Belgium";;"Koch, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, Korte Meer 3-5, B-9000 Ghent, Flanders, Belgium.; Koch, T (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Sociol, Avda Playa Ancha 850, Valparaiso, Chile.";Tomas.Koch@UGent.be;"; Ayala, Ricardo A./E-1335-2018";"Koch, Tomas/0000-0002-7408-4556; Ayala, Ricardo A./0000-0001-7840-1072";"DGI-UPLA [CSO01-1121]; ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2015 [72160036]";This work received funding from DGI-UPLA (CSO01-1121) and ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2015 - 72160036.;;47;1;1;0;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0026-4695;1573-1871;;MINERVA;Minerva;MAR;2021;59;1;;;;;99;122;;10.1007/s11024-020-09421-6;;OCT 2020;24;"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics";QI8IP;WOS:000579791600001;;;;;2022-04-06;

There is no reliable and valid instrument for assessing QoL in people with ID in Colombia. We investigated the internal structure of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale and tested whether the scale identified the eight interrelated domains of the QoL conceptual framework originally described by. MethodData were collected from 602 adults with moderate levels of ID and respective proxies, who completed the self-report and the report by other scales, respectively. Five measurement models were tested through confirmatory factor analysis. ResultsThe eight correlated dimension model showed the best fit to the data. Reliability and convergent validity of the indicators were satisfactory in both versions of the scale (self-report and proxy report). ConclusionsThis study contributes to research on QoL measurement by providing the first empirical evidence regarding the dimensionality, internal structure and psychometric properties of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale. Moreover, the study presents the first adaptation of a specific QoL scale for people with ID in Colombia, which may in the future be useful for implementing evidence-based practices and developing person-centred support plans.;"[Verdugo-Alonso, M.

That way, different services may be needed at various stages of their lifetimes. This study aimed to describe service encounters and hours of service per week for individuals with ASD in Latin American countries and compare the data from three age groups (preschoolers, school-aged, and adolescents). Methods: The data were obtained from an online survey adapted by Red Espectro Autista Latinoamerica (REAL) in 6 different South & Central American countries. The total sample was composed of 2520 caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD. Results: Service encounters for Speech, Occupational, and Behavioral Therapies decreased with patient age, while medication increased. Regardless of the age group, a large proportion of individuals (19-37 %) were not receiving treatment, and those receiving treatment got fewer hours than best practice recommendations. For adolescents, the gaps in treatment are even greater and less consistent. Discussion: Failure to offer timely identification and intervention for ASD will result in more impairment of the individual and the family burden. Although there are several initiatives to develop more resources for this population in Latin-America, the provision of services for ASD is still undervalued. Many such individuals might not be receiving the services they need, while;"[Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA Programa Argentino Ninos Adolescentes &, B1640EMQ, RA-1145 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Dept Montevideo, Bulevar Gen Artigas 1550, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Valdez, Daniel] FLACSO, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Valdez, Daniel] Univ Buenos Aires, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Dev Disorder Program, Rua Consolacao,930Consolacao, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 1058, Santiago, Chile; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Irarrazaval, Matias] Millenium Inst Res Depress & Personal, Avda Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile";;Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.;"cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu; sebastiancukier@panaacea.org; gabrielagarridof86@gmail.com; daniel.valdez@me.com; csilvestrep09@gmail.com; ricardo.garcia.sepulveda@gmail.com; analiarosolimurillo@gmail.com; matias.irarrazaval@minsal.cl; alexiarattazzi@panaacea.org";"paula, cristiane S/D-8968-2017; Montiel, Cecilia/AAP-1153-2020; Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022";"paula, cristiane S/0000-0003-0438-9407; Montiel, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Irarrazaval, Matias/0000-0002-9087-8305; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422";;;;86;5;5;0;3;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-9467;1878-0237;;RES AUTISM SPECT DIS;Res.

The current article evaluates the measurement invariance of the BMSLSS across cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study sampled 7,739 adolescents and emerging adults in 23 countries. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit of configural and partial measurement weights invariance models, indicating similar patterns and strengths in factor loading for both adolescents and emerging adults across various countries. We found insufficient evidence for scalar invariance in both the adolescents' and the emerging adults' samples. A multi-level confirmatory factor analysis indicated configural invariance of the structure at country and individual level. Internal consistency, evaluated by alpha and omega coefficients per country, yielded acceptable results. The translated BMSLSS across different cultural contexts presents good psychometric characteristics similar to what has been reported in the original scale, though scalar invariance remains problematic. Our results indicate that the BMSLSS forms a brief measure of life satisfaction, which has accrued substantial evidence of construct validity, thus suitable for use in cross-cultural surveys with adolescents and emerging adults, although evaluation of degree of invariance must be carried out to ensure its suitability for mean comparisons.;"[Abubakar, Amina; van de Vijver, Fons; He, Jia; Adams, Byron; Celenk, Ozgur; Perdomo, Cristina; Suryani, Angela] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Abubakar, Amina] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Barcelona, Spain; [Aldhafri, Said] Sultan Qaboot Univ, Muscat, Oman; [Aldhafri, Said] Bahcesehir Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arasa, Josephine] US Int Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Boer, Diana] Univ Koblenz Landau, Koblenz, Germany; [Dimitrova, Radosveta] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ferreira, Maria Cristina] Salgado Oliveira Univ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fischer, Ronald] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Fischer, Ronald] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Mbebeb, Fomba Emmanuel] Univ Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon; [Frias, Maria Teresa] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Fresno, Andres; Spencer, Rosario] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Gillath, Omri] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Harb, Charles] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; [Handani, Penny; Pandia, Weny Savitry; Suryani, Angela] Atma Jaya Catholic Univ, Jarkata, Indonesia; [Hapunda, Given] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Kamble, Shanmukh] Karnatak Univ, Dharwad, Karnataka, India; [Kosic, Marianna] Slovene Res Inst, Sci Cultural Inst Mandala, Trieste, Italy; [Looh, Joseph Lah] Univ Buea, Buea, Cameroon; [Mazrui, Lubna; Murugami, Margaret] Kenyatta Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mendia, Rafael Emilio] Univ Rafael Landivar, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Mason-Li, Mei] Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Schachner, Maja] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Sim, Samantha] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Tair, Ergyul] Bulgarian Acad Sci, BG-1040 Sofia, Bulgaria";;Abubakar, A (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Culture Studies, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;A.AbubakarAli@uvt.nl;"van de Vijver, Fons/A-4317-2012; Schachner, Maja/S-2262-2018; Kamble, Shanmukh Vasant/ABE-6993-2021; Gillath, Omri/A-8171-2009; Karakulak, Arzu/K-8481-2019; Aldhafri, Said S./A-9355-2017; Adams, Byron/H-3098-2018; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/B-5095-2011; Fischer, Ronald/G-6447-2017";"van de Vijver, Fons/0000-0003-0220-2485; Aldhafri, Said S./0000-0002-1776-263X; Adams, Byron/0000-0001-5968-1996; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/0000-0002-4638-085X; Fischer, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-3955; Gillath, Omri/0000-0001-8791-227X; kamble, shanmukh/0000-0002-2185-8052; Sembiring Pandia, Weny Savitry/0000-0002-6878-0571; Suryani, Angela Oktavia/0000-0001-5016-4802; Spencer, Rosario/0000-0002-4546-4226";;;;35;21;21;1;32;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0734-2829;1557-5144;;J PSYCHOEDUC ASSESS;J.
