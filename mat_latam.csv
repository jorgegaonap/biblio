The study consisted of videotaped problem-solving sessions in which pairs of 8th graders worked on linear function tasks using a winch apparatus, a device with springs, and a computerized input-output machine. The following questions are addressed: How do children make sense of physical devices designed by experts to foster mathematical learning? How does the use of such devices enable learners to access selected aspects of a mathematical domain? The concept of transparency is suggested as an index of access to knowledge and activities rather than as an inherent feature of objects. The analysis shows that transparency is a process mediated by unfolding activities and users' participation in ongoing socioculturel practices.","Functions; Instructional technology; Manipulatives; Middle grades, 5-8; Patterns, relationships in mathematics; Protocol analysis; Representations, modeling; Social and cultural issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944432729

To conduct the survey we have used internet search engines with keywords related to mathematics education and digital technology and have reviewed some of the main international journals, including the ones in Portuguese and Spanish. We identify five sub-areas of research, important trends of development, and illustrate them using case studies: mobile technologies, massive open online courses (MOOCs), digital libraries and designing learning objects, collaborative learning using digital technology, and teacher training using blended learning. These examples of case studies may help the reader to understand how recent developments in this area of research have evolved in the last few years. We conclude the report discussing some of the implications that these digital technologies may have for mathematics education research and practice as well as making some recommendations for future research in this area. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Blended learning; Collaborative learning; Digital libraries; Internet; Learning objects; Mobile learning; MOOC",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978114994

Students were asked to sketch the graph of a function, given its analytic properties (1st and 2nd derivatives, limits, and continuity) on specific intervals of the domain. The triad of schema development in the context of APOS theory was utilized to study students' responses. Two dimensions of understanding emerged, 1 involving properties and the other involving intervals. A student's coordination of the 2 dimensions is referred to as that student's overall calculus graphing schema. Additionally, a number of conceptual problems were consistently demonstrated by students throughout the study, and these difficulties are discussed in some detail.","Calculus; Cognitive theory; College mathematics; Conceptual knowledge; Constructivism; Epistemology; Piaget; Qualitative methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24944558573

The authors’ research with teachers has led them to explore the characteristics of MKT and to refine the descriptors relating to its sub-domains, a task which has underlined the difficulty involved in unambiguously delimiting the boundaries which separate these. As a result, and taking into consideration a broader view of the specialised nature of the teacher’s mathematical knowledge, the authors propose a framework which, whilst respecting the major domains of Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge, regards the specialisation in respect of mathematical knowledge as a property which is inherent to the model and extends across all sub-domains. © 2018, © 2018 British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics.","mathematical knowledge for teaching; specialised knowledge; Teachers’ knowledge",,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO; Universidad de Huelva, UHU","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP), and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Ministry of Economy Industry and Competitiveness.","The Spanish Government (EDU2013-44047-P and EDU2016-81994-REDT), the Mexican Sub-secretary of Higher Education (PRODEP) and the Research Centre COIDESO (University of Huelva, Spain) supported this research.",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050277223

We identify four trends in the calculus research literature, starting with identifying misconceptions to investigations of the processes by which students learn particular concepts, evolving into classroom studies, and, more recently research on teacher knowledge, beliefs, and practices. These trends are related to a model for the cycle of research and development aimed at improving learning and teaching. We then make use of these four trends and the model for the cycle of research and development to highlight the contributions of the papers in this issue. We conclude with some reflections on the gaps in literature and what new areas of calculus research are needed. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Calculus; Cycle of research and development; Future directions; Trends in calculus research",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926283069

It takes as a starting point a previous survey, commissioned for ICME 10 in 2004 that focused on Mathematics Teacher Education. The current survey focuses centrally on teachers involved in collaborations, sometimes in formal settings of professional development, but also in a more diverse range of collaborative settings including research initiatives. The roles of teachers involved in the collaboration, survey methods, decisions and limitations are described. While some of the findings to date resonate with those of the earlier survey, other findings highlight characteristics and issues relating to the differing ways in which teachers collaborate, either with other teachers or the various ‘others’, most notably mathematics teacher educator researchers. The roles and relationships that contribute to learning in such collaborations, as well as theories and methodologies found in survey sources, are a focus of the findings presented here. Studies rarely theorised collaboration, and few of those that did so reported explicitly on how their theoretical frame shaped the design of research methodologies/approaches guiding activities with teachers. One significant outcome has been the difficulty of relating teachers’ learning to collaboration within a project, although many initiatives report developments in teaching, teacher learning and students’ learning. © 2016, The Author(s).","Community of inquiry; Community of practice; Lesson study; Mathematics teaching; Mathematics teaching development; Teacher collaboration; Teacher learning; Teacher professional development",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: 26245082; Norges Forskningsråd; University of Tsukuba","We should like to express sincere thanks to Masami Isoda and the University of Tsukuba for funding two survey team meetings in Tokyo in 2015 and 2016 with JSPS grant No. 26245082.

Results of the analyses showed that these successful calculus students, who appeared to be operating at varying stages of development of their calculus graphing schemata, illustrated the complexity involved in achieving thematization of the schema, thus demonstrating that thematization was possible.","Advanced mathematical thinking; Calculus/analysis; Clinical interviews; Cognitive theory; College mathematics; Higher order thinking; Learning theories; Secondary mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447567380

In the second part of the article, alternative views are offered to each of these orientations that direct attention to underexplored issues about what makes mathematics teacher knowledge specialized. Collectively, these alternative views suggest that specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge cannot be comprehensively accounted for by ‘what’ teachers know, but rather by ‘how’ teachers’ knowing comes into being.

Approximately 1,100 teachers from six countries (Cyprus, India, Israel, Latvia, Mexico, and Romania) participated in a 100-item questionnaire addressing teachers' conceptions about: (1) Who is a creative student in mathematics, (2) Who is a creative mathematics teacher, (3) In what way is creativity in mathematics related to culture, and (4) Who is a creative person. We present responses to each conception focusing on differences between teachers from different countries. We also analyze relationships among teachers' conceptions of creativity and their experience, and educational level.

We use APOS theory and semiotic representation theory as a theoretical framework to analyze data obtained from interviews with thirteen students who had taken a multivariable calculus course. Results show that few students were able to construct an object conception of function of two variables. Most students showed difficulties finding domains of functions, in particular, when they were restricted to a specific region in the xy plane. They also showed that they had not fully coordinated their R 3, set, and function of one variable schemata. We conclude from the analysis that many of the interviewed students' notion of function can be considered as pre-Bourbaki. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","APOS; Representations; Schema; Semiotic representation theory; Two-variable function",,,"This project was partially supported by Asociación Mexicana de Cultura AC.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867096292

Starting from Papert's introduction of the concept during ICME 2 in 1972, we trace the evolution of theoretical approaches concerning the essence of the idea in an attempt to situate the notion of constructionism in the light of contemporary frameworks. We argue that microworlds, and the search for a learnable mathematics, have a continued relevance to mathematics education, but that the lens research attention has shifted over time, with the current foci on communal design, situated and embodied approaches and artefacts whose use crosses boundaries between different practices. To illustrate these shifts and the challenges that still remain, we present examples from our current work involving the use of microworlds for learning and teaching through communication, design and construction. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Body and ego synonicity; Boundary objects; Communal design; Microworlds",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2004/15109-9, 2005/60655-4","Acknowledgments and projects We would like to thank Guilher-me Rodrigues Margalhães, Maisa Aparecida Sigueira Rodrigues, Elen Graciele Martins, Franklin Rodrigues de Souza and Amarilis Reto Ferreira for their ongoing contributions to the design of the musiCALcolorida microworld and FAPESP (Fundac¸ão de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) for their financial support in this endeavour (grant nos. 2004/15109-9 and 2005/60655-4).

TIMSS, especially, has demonstrated the central role that the concept of opportunity to learn plays in understanding cross-national differences in achievement Schmidt et al., (Why schools matter: A cross-national comparison of curriculum and learning 2001). The curricular expectations of a nation and the actual content exposure that is delivered to students by teachers were found to be among the most salient features of schooling related to academic performance. The other feature that emerges in these studies is the importance of the teacher. The professional competence of the teacher which includes substantive knowledge regarding formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy is suggested as being significant-not just in understanding cross-national differences but also in other studies as well (Hill et al. in Am Educ Res J 42(2):371-406, 2005). Mathematics Teaching in the 21st Century (MT21) is a small, six-country study that collected data on future lower secondary teachers in their last year of preparation. One of the findings noted in the first report of that study was that the opportunities future teachers experienced as part of their formal education varied across the six countries (Schmidt et al. in The preparation gap: Teacher education for middle school mathematics in six countries, 2007). This variation in opportunity to learn (OTL) existed in course work related to formal mathematics, mathematics pedagogy and general pedagogy. It appears from these initial results that OTL not only is important in understanding K-12 student learning but it is also likely important in understanding the knowledge base of the teachers who teach them which then has the potential to influence student learning as well. This study using the same MT21 data examines in greater detail the configuration of the educational opportunities future teachers had during their teacher education in some 34 institutions across the six countries. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.","Comparative study of teacher education; Mathematics teacher education; Opportunities to learn; Teacher education curriculum; Teacher preparation",,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0231886","Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. 0231886.

This course was designed to address discrepancies between how students learn and how they were traditionally being taught. Based on results from the first implementation, pedagogical changes were made, including increased computer programming activities and other exercises which were designed to give the students the opportunity to build experience to draw on in order to construct understanding of the topics in class. A second experimental course was run. To assess the impact of these methods, and to continue to better understand how students go about learning, test results from the latter class and interviews with students from both experimental courses and a lecture-based class were analyzed. The students in the second experimental course demonstrated a deep understanding of the title concepts, especially cosets and normality. We discuss the details of the revised experimental course; the epistemological theory behind its design; and the framework used to analyze the results. We demonstrate through examples from interviews and test results the applicability of this analysis to the data, and the strides made by the students in comparison with the students from the lecture-based course, and with the students from the first experimental course.

Task-based interviews were used to collect data and thematic analysis was used to analyze them. Through the analysis of the productions of the 25 participants, we identified 223 intra-mathematical connections. The data allowed us to establish a mathematical connections system which contributes to the understanding of higher concepts, in our case, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

In light of this, the Gradual Immersion Method (GIM) was designed to enhance collaborative creativity using interactive devices and augmented reality (AR), to support creativity-based learning, such as in the integrated study of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). The GIM consists of three intuitive modules wherein learners collaboratively achieve learning object goals through interaction with images and 3D models, in a sequential transition from 2D to 3D and then to AR.

To approach the question of how research can support practice to assist these students one has to clarify the group or groups of students that we are talking about. The following contribution firstly concentrates on the problem of labelling the group of students having mathematical difficulties as there does not exist a single definition. This problem might be put down to the different roots of mathematics education on the one hand and special education on the other hand. Research results with respect to concepts and models for instruction are multifaceted based on the specific content and mathematical topics as well as the underlying view of mathematics. Taking into account inclusive education, a closer orientation to mathematical education can be identified and the potential of selected teaching and learning concepts can be illustrated. Beyond this, the role of the teacher, their attitudes and beliefs and the corresponding teacher education programs are discussed. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Inclusive education; Mathematical learning difficulties; Special education; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978035360

Given the inherent dialogical nature of formative assessment in the classroom, video can provide a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing teachers' formative assessment interactions with students. In this study, we provide a framework for examining expertise in formative assessment and use this framework to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the practices of 13 mathematics and science teachers. While we only saw a few instances of true expertise in formative assessment practices in our examination of videos, our findings indicate that teachers with more expertise in formative assessment let students' ideas guide their teaching. This leads to higher correlations among the dimensions of practice that we articulate in our framework for expert teachers. However, because many of the instructional decisions that teachers make are not visible on video, video alone may not provide enough information to judge expertise in formative assessment. © 2015, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Formative assessment; Mathematics; Science; Video analysis",,"Michigan Department of Education, MDE","Work on the Formative Assessment for Michigan Educators (FAME) project was supported by the Michigan Department of Education.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939975965

Baldwin introduced a powerful view regarding Darwinian Evolution. Baldwin suggested that behavioral flexibility could play a role in amplifying natural selection because this ability enables individuals to modify the environment of natural selection affecting the fate of future generations. In this view, behavior can affect evolution but, and this is crucial, without claiming that responses to environmental demands acquired during one's lifetime could be passed directly to one's offspring. In the present paper, we want to use this view as a guiding metaphor to cast light on understanding how students and teachers can utilize the environment of digital technologies to scaffold their activities.

We identify three domains in which new approaches are being generated by mathematic educators: principles of design of new settings; social interaction and construction knowledge; and tools and resources. The papers in this issue reflect different perspectives developed in the last decade in these three domains, providing evidence of the advances in theoretical frameworks and support in the generation of new meanings for old constructs such as ‘tool’, ‘resources’ or ‘learning setting’. We firstly highlight the different ways in which the use of digital technologies generates new ways of thinking about mathematics and the settings in which it is learnt, and how mathematics teacher educators frame the new initiatives of initial training and professional development.

We argue that cognition is both embodied and situated in the activities through which it occurs and that mathematics learning involves the appropriation of practices associated with the sets of artefacts that have historically come to represent the body of knowledge we call mathematics. This process of appropriation involves a coordination of a variety of the semiotic resources-spoken and written languages, mathematical representation systems, drawings, gestures and the like-through which mathematical objects and relationships might be experienced and expressed. To highlight the connections between perceptual activities and cultural concepts in the meanings associated with this process, we concentrate on learners who do not have access to the visual field. More specifically, we present three examples of gesture use in the practices of blind mathematics students-all involving the exploration of geometrical objects and relationships. On the basis of our analysis of these examples, we argue that gestures are illustrative of imagined reenactions of previously experienced activities and that they emerge in instructional situations as embodied abstractions, serving a central role in the sense-making practices associated with the appropriation of mathematical meanings. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abstraction; Blind mathematics learners; Embodied cognition; Gestures; Mediation",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2004/15109-9; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 23038.019444/2009-33","4We are grateful to the funding we have received from FAPESP (Project no. 2004/15109-9) and CAPES (Project no. 23038.019444/2009-33) in the course of this programme of research.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956317606

It became much easier for students who were not fond of algebraic representations to work with concepts such as function using graphs or tables. Research on how students use such software showed that they shaped the tools to their own needs, resulting in an intershaping relationship in which tools shape the way students know at the same time the students shape the tools and influence the design of the next generation of tools. This kind of research led to the theoretical perspective presented in this paper: knowledge is constructed by collectives of humans-with-media. In this paper, I will discuss how media have shaped the notions of problem and knowledge, and a parallel will be developed between the way that software has brought new possibilities to mathematics education and the changes that the Internet may bring to mathematics education. This paper is, therefore, a discussion about the future of mathematics education.

Here, we evaluate if inhibitory processes play a specific role in the particular case of fraction comparison, where learners must ignore the potentially misleading information provided by the natural numbers composing fractions (e.g. 2/3 > 4/7 despite 2 < 4 and 3 < 7). To do this, we presented a sample of Chilean children (N = 450) from 5th, 6th, and 7th grade with a numerical comparison task tapping inhibitory and other processes. Results showed that both general math achievement and accuracy in comparing fractions were significantly predicted by inhibition. The former association, however, turned out to mediate the latter one. Another process, related to visual priming, predicted children’s likelihood to answer fraction comparison items focusing exclusively on the fraction components. This relation was, furthermore, not mediated by general math achievement. Altogether, these findings shed light on the mental processes underlying the early stages of the learning of fractions. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Fraction comparison; Inhibitory control; Mathematics achievement; Natural number bias; Numerical Stroop task; Visual priming",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: FB0003","The authors are grateful to the administrators, teachers, parents, and children of the school network who took part in this study, to Benjamín Bossi and Sergio Orellana for their assistance in collecting the data, and to anonymous reviewers who made invaluable contributions to this manuscript.

To support research on prediction in the context of mathematics education, we present three perspectives on prediction: (1) prediction as a mental act highlights the cognitive aspect and the conceptual basis of one's prediction, (2) prediction as a mathematical activity highlights the spectrum of prediction tasks that are common in mathematics curricula and (3) prediction as a socio-epistemological practice highlights the construction of mathematical knowledge in classrooms. Each perspective supports the claim that prediction when used effectively can foster mathematical learning.

We address this problem through an interpretative analysis of a whole-group conversation about alternative ways of solving a problem involving percent discounts that occurred in a sixth grade classroom. This research study draws upon Dewey's theory of inquiry, Vygotsky's cultural-historical psychology, Freudenthal's realistic mathematics education, and Halliday's systemic functional linguistics (SFL). From Freudenthal, we borrow the notions of mathematizing and guided reinvention-the former notion offers a view of mathematics as an activity of structuring subject matter and the latter one provides insights into the processes whereby mathematizing is learned and taught in the classroom. We glean from Dewey his view of reflective thinking as inquiry and the role that conversations may serve therein. We rely upon Vygotsky's notions of a verbal thinking plane and a social phase of learning in order to reconsider the function of whole-class interaction in apprenticing students into mathematizing. Finally, SFL provides us with tools for explaining the choices of grammar and vocabulary students and teachers make as they realize meanings in whole-group conversations. Treating the selected whole-class conversation as a text, we focus our analysis on how this text came to mean what it did. Our central questions are as follows: What meanings were realized in the whole-class conversation by teacher and students and how were these meanings realized? How did the teacher's lexico-grammatical choices guide the students' choices? In addressing these questions, we advance an interpretation of the conversation as paradigmatic of students and teacher thinking aloud together about percents. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Bar model; Functional grammar; Mathematizing; Percents; Reflective thinking; Semiotic mediation; Whole-class interaction",,"City University of New York","Acknowledgment We wish to thank Norma Presmeg as well as the three anonymous reviewers for their very helpful editorial comments and suggestions.

The aim of this article is to contribute in this direction, investigating how visual representations can structure geometry activity in the classroom and discussing teaching practices that can facilitate students' visualization of mathematical objects. We present one illustrative episode that shows how drawings of geometrical figures have a powerful role in structuring and modifying the mathematical activity in the classroom. It was selected from a database that we have been building to investigate the learning of mathematics in public elementary schools in Brazil. The framework of Activity Theory helped in the characterization of the episode as a system of interconnected activities. We discuss the changes and transformations perceived in those activities; and we explore the idea of miniature cycles of learning actions to focus on the mathematical learning that is taking place. We describe the dynamics and the complexity of the ongoing activity in the calculation of areas; and, how drawings form a part, and show their influence, in it. We argue that part of this influence was associated with the contradiction between abstract mathematical ideas and their empirical representations, revealed by the tensions perceived in the activities analysed; and, simultaneously, that we could see as an impelling force for the learning of the rules and norms which regulate the use of visual representations in school mathematics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Activity Theory; Drawings; Geometry; Visual representations; Visualization in mathematics education",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG","Acknowledgments The authors want to declare, first of all, their gratitude to the teacher and students involved in this study, for all we have learned with them.

Two empirical studies on the use of analogies in primary classrooms are discussed and analysed. In the first study, the 'string circuit' analogy was used in the teaching of electric circuits with students aged 8-9. In the second study, the 'making a cake' analogy was introduced within the study of photosynthesis with students aged 10-11. Outcomes of both studies are scrutinised to assess the effectiveness of analogies as tools for meaning making. How the analogies are presented, their contexts, and how much students are involved in mapping the analogical relations appear to be determinant. This strongly suggests that research and pedagogical practice should shift from determining the effectiveness of analogy in cognitive transfer, from analogue to target domains, towards the recognition of its role in generating engagement in developing meaningful explanations through discourse. Finally, most salient aspects of the use of analogies are considered for contexts in which they are used to promote understanding of scientific ideas. Analogy can play and important role in that task if it is seen as a resource to promote understanding and meaning making but its strengths and limitations are not ignored. © 2011 by EURASIA.","Analogy; Classroom settings; Primary education; Research analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952606711

Results from 2 studies show that use of commutativity to solve multiplication problems is closely related to use of multiplication. Street sellers who rely exclusively on repeated addition to solve such problems may, however, use multiplicative commutativity if it represents a clear reduction in the number of computational steps needed to reach a solution.

Two questions were considered during this investigation: What types of metaphors does the teacher use to explain the graphic representation of functions at high-school level? Is the teacher aware of the use he/she has made of metaphors in his/her speech, and to what extent does he/she monitor them? The theoretical framework was based on embodied cognition theory. Our findings include teachers' expressions that suggest, among other ideas: (1) orientation metaphors, such as ""the abscissa axis is horizontal""; (2) fictive motion, such as ""the graph of a function can be considered as the trace of a point that moves over the graph"" (3) ontological metaphors; and (4) interaction of metaphors. We also show that teachers were not aware of using metaphors. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cartesian graphs; Discourse; Image schema; Metaphor",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957913273

In this article, we will present a teaching situation about periodic functions, which was designed with this perspective in mind. The design was based on the assumption that the scientific notion of periodic function is related with the social practice of prediction. In the situation, prediction as a social practice is transformed into a situational line of argument which redefines that which is periodical. The situation brings into play meanings for the repetition of a movement, which takes place in time in the context of graphs of functions. Our analysis of the situation will focus on the prediction tools that participants generated in order to define that which is periodical.

During this period, beginning mathematics teachers confront tensions and contradictions among the principles, ideals, and experiences encountered during pre-service education and the demands, and restrictions of their teaching practice in schools. This article approaches this topic by developing an interpretative case study centered on one novice mathematics teacher, Sol. The aim is to describe and understand the development of Sol’s professional identity and agency during her first teaching year. Considering identity development as a diachronic phenomenon, we carry out a narrative analysis of the research data. The findings show that Sol developed her professional identity and agency through a process that gathered together the teaching practices possible inside her school, the positions she could negotiate as a newcomer inside the institution, and the cultural practices and discourses embodied during pre-service education. The results bring to the forefront the profound and tense interactions between the intimate and personal terrain of mathematics teachers and the social and cultural world of the schools where they work. Sol’s case also contributes to understanding the role that a robust pre-service education can play in the development of beginning teachers’ professional identities and in the possibility they could become agents of transformation in their schools. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agency; Beginning mathematics teachers; Narrative analysis; Pre-service teacher education; Professional identity",,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET: 4467/12; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 312929/2013-7","Sol’s first year as a secondary school mathematics teacher was 2013.

A 5-point Likert scale, AMMEC, was used to measure attitudes towards mathematics (AM), computer-based mathematics (AMC), and selfconfidence in mathematics (CM). A total of 430 students using technology for mathematics and 109 students not using it were monitored for 3 years. At the beginning of the study, the participants were aged about 13 years. The statistical analyses of the data showed few gender differences in the way students' attitudes and self-confidence changed over the 3 years. Significant gender differences favouring boys were found in attitudes towards mathematics in grades 8 and 9 for the group using technology. For the group using technology, significantly more boys than girls got high scores in attitudes towards computer-based mathematics in grade 7. Significantly, more girls using technology than girls not using it got high scores in grade 8. The use of technology did not have a positive impact on students' self-confidence. Regardless of whether they used computers or not, from grades 7 to 9, there was a decrease in the self-confidence in mathematics of both boys and girls. To enrich these results and detect possible gender differences in the way attitudes were constructed, 12 girls and 13 boys were interviewed at the end of the study. The analysis of the arguments they presented to explain and justify their attitudes towards mathematics, computerbased mathematics, and their self-confidence in working in mathematics provided evidence of important gender differences in the ways in which boys and girls construct their attitude, indicating how their constructions reflect the gender stereotypes within Mexican society. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2008.",,,"SEP/SEBYN-CONACYT 2003-CO1-22","Acknowledgments This research was partly sponsored by CONA-CYT (Project SEP/SEBYN-CONACYT 2003-CO1-22).

Grounded on a conception of proof that includes both empirical and deductive mathematical argumentations, we show the trajectories of some students progressing from developing basic empirical proofs towards developing deductive proofs and understanding the role of conjectures and proofs in mathematics. Our analysis of students’ solutions is based on networking Boero et al.’s construct of cognitive unity of theorems, Pedemonte’s structural and referential analysis of conjectures and proofs, and Balacheff and Margolinas’ cK¢ model, while using Toulmin schemes to represent students’ productions. This combination has allowed us to identify several emerging types of cognitive unity/rupture, corresponding to different ways of solving conjecture-and-proof problems.

They can perceive their own creation of the different curves: parabola, circle, ellipse and hyperbola. A dynamical animation to visualize the focus and directrix of the parabola is presented by introducing the Dandelin Spheres into the virtual environment. Besides the motivational element it offers, the purpose is to promote an active learning through the affordances of augmented reality technology.

Phase two can be characterized by research with software designed to address traditional mathematics topics, such as functions, while the third phase is characterized by online courses.

The paper is analyzed from a perspective that emphasizes the role of different technologies as teachers and professors collaborate to produce knowledge about the use of mathematical software in regular face-to-face classrooms. A model of online education is presented. Finally, the paper discusses how technology may change collaboration and teaching approaches in continuing education, as it allows for greater integration of online learning with teachers’ classroom activities in schools.

To start filling this gap this qualitative research has the aim to identify emotional experiences of undergraduate mathematics students in Linear Algebra courses. In order to obtain data, retrospective focus group interviews were carried out with 27 students. Data analysis is based on the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies eliciting conditions for each emotion and the variables that affect intensity of emotions. Results show that the participants’ emotional experiences in Linear Algebra courses are: satisfaction and disappointment emotions, fear emotions, distress emotions and self-reproach emotions. These emotions are triggered by the appraisal of different situations like the difficulty attributed to Linear Algebra courses, solving problems, asking questions in class, going to the blackboard to solve problems and failure in a course. The students’ emotional experiences are based on their appraisal of the situations in terms of specific goals and standards.

It has a three-fold purpose: to show that students may construct two essentially different notions of infinite series, to show that one of the constructions is particularly difficult for students, and to examine the way in which these two different constructions may be built so that we may uncover ways to help students improve their understanding. The theoretical framework consists of action-process-object-schema theory and the specific model of conceptions in Balacheff's theory of conception, knowing, and concept. Approaching the problem from these two different theoretical perspectives allows us to provide different and at the same time complementary explanations of observed phenomena. The two different infinite series constructions are, briefly stated, series as an infinite unending process of addition and series as a sequence of partial sums. Students are found to have difficulty building an understanding of series as a sequence of partial sums and thus tend to have difficulty in problem situations that require this interpretation. The study uses semi-structured interviews with 10 graduate students. The interviews explore situations that might give insight into students' notion of the sequence of partial sums. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","APOS theory; Conceptions; Infinite sequence; Infinite series; Limits",,,"Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Professor Ed Dubinsky for his guidance and many insightful comments.

A group of five pre-service teachers designed and conducted a study of children's understanding of fractions. As participant-observers throughout their study we gathered evidence of change in pre-service teachers' representations of children's knowledge of fractions. The focus of our observations was on the conflicts generated by the gaps between the pre-service teachers' research findings and their representations of the children's knowledge of fractions. Results indicate that research experience is fruitful in developing an inquisitive disposition in pre-service teachers and in sensitizing future teachers to children's knowledge of a mathematical concept. Pre-service teachers became familiar with the research literature regarding children's understanding of fractions, they questioned the typical instructional sequence of teaching fractions and they scrutinized methods of assessing children's knowledge of mathematical topics. © 1992, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In solving linear equations, the students did not exhibit the 'didactic cut' of Filloy and Rojano (1989) or the subtleties arising from conceiving an equation as a balance (Vlassis, 2002). Instead they used 'procedural embodiments', shifting terms around with added 'rules' to obtain the correct answer (Lima & Tall, 2008). Faced with quadratic equations, the students learn to apply the formula with little success. The interpretation of this data requires earlier theories to be seen within a more comprehensive framework that places them in an evolving context. We use the developing framework of three worlds of mathematics (Tall, 2004, 2013), based fundamentally on human perceptions and actions and their consequences, at each stage taking into account the experiences that students have 'met-before' (Lima & Tall, 2008; McGowen & Tall, 2010). These experiences may be supportive in new contexts, encouraging pleasurable generalization, or problematic, causing confusion and even mathematical anxiety. We consider how this framework explains and predicts the observed data, how it evolves from earlier theories, and how it gives insights that have both theoretical and practical consequences. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Procedural embodiment; Quadratic equations; Solving equations; Theories of learning; Three worlds of mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893519092

Our results indicate that reform and traditional teaching are not opposite sides of a one-dimensional axis. They also emphasize both that reform teaching is related to higher school average achievement in mathematics and that the dissemination of reform teaching contributes to minimize the achievement gap between students who attend schools with low average SES and students who attend schools with high average SES.

The results of the investigation show notable changes in the maintenance factors associated with the teachers’ questions and feedback, the scaffolding provided for the students’ reasoning and the modelling of high-level performance. In terms of the decline in the level of cognitive demand, the greatest changes were found in factors corresponding to the routinization of problematic aspects of the task and to problems in lesson management. Based on the results of our collaborative work with teachers in the context of Lesson Study, we conclude that it is possible to design and implement statistical tasks in primary school classrooms that maintain high cognitive demand. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cognitive demand; Lesson Study; Primary school; Teachers",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 11140092, 11140472, 1171076","This research acknowledges financial support from FONDECYT Project Nos. 11140472, 11140092 and 1171076.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059872284

Within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, this step is approached using the study and research paths for teacher education (SRP-TE), an inquiry-based process combining practical and theoretical questioning of school mathematical activities. We present a research study focusing on the design and analysis of an online and distance-learning course for in-service mathematics teachers based on the SRP-TE methodology. This course starts from the initial question of how to analyse, adapt and integrate a learning process related to mathematical modelling and how to sustain its long-term development. Our analysis is based on a case study consisting in four successive editions of a course for Latin American in-service mathematics teachers held at the Centre for Applied Research in Advanced Science and Technology in Mexico. The starting point is a modelling activity about forecasting the number of Facebook users, which includes functional modelling and regression. The results show how the course represents a valuable instrument to help teachers progress in the critical issue of identifying institutional constraints—most of them beyond the scope of action of teachers and students and not approached by previous research—hindering the integration of mathematical modelling in current secondary schools. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2018.","Anthropological theory of the didactic; Ecology; Functions; Institutional constraints; Mathematical modelling; Study and research path; Teacher education",,"EDU2015-64646-P; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","Acknowledgements The research leading to these results has received funding from the Spanish R&D Projects: EDU2015-64646-P and EDU2015-69865-C3-1-R (MINECO/FEDER, UE).","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Spanish R&D Projects: Ministerio de Economía y CompetitividadMINECOEDU2015-64646-P and",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055630769

Participants were encouraged to construct dynamic representations of tasks and always to look for different ways to identify and support mathematical relations. To this end, three interrelated geneses (instrumental, semiotic, discursive) proposed in the Mathematical Working Space frame are used to document ways in which the participants constructed dynamic configuration of mathematical tasks as a means initially to explore invariants and eventually formulate conjectures based on empirical arguments. Technology affordances that involve dragging objects, quantifying parameters, graphing loci and using sliders were important for the participants to articulate semiotic and discursive geneses. Thus, the participants’ approaches that appeared individual, small group and plenary discussions contributed to identifying initial conjectures that later were analyzed via empirical, geometric or algebraic arguments. In addition, the participants recognized that a working space to understand mathematical ideas and to solve problems should foster mathematical discussions beyond formal settings. The use of digital technologies plays an important role in both representing and exploring mathematical tasks and in following the discussion outside the formal class. As a result, the participants outlined a possible route to implement a route for learners to integrate activities to account for instrumental, semiotic, and discursive genesis. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Digital technologies; Empirical and formal reasoning; Mathematical Working Space; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988443676

Questions that helped us structure the research included: How do students interpret and deal with the concept of solution to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)? To which extent do students use mathematical concepts they have previously studied to answer basic questions related to ODEs? And, to what extent do the students’ answers privilege the use of certain type of representation to explore and examine issues related to ODEs? Results indicate that, in general, students choose one of two methods to verify whether a function represents a solution to a given ODE: a substitution method or by solving directly the given equation. It was observed that they do not rely on concepts associated with the meaning of derivative to make sense and deal with situations that involve basic ODEs’ ideas; rather, they tend to reduce their knowledge of ODEs to the search for an algorithm (analytical approach) to solve particular groups of equations. In addition, there is evidence that students do not use graphic representations to explore meanings and mathematical relations and they experience difficulties to move back and forth from one type of representation to another. © 2012, Drustvo Matematicara Srbije.

One of them is the Methodology of Math Teaching-Learning- Evaluation through Problem Solving, based on clear foundations and an approach of renewal. In addition to that methodology, two aspects have been developed by the group: The conception of Math as a science of pattern and order and Discrete Mathematics.

Task-based interviews were used to collect data which included two graphical tasks that involved the derivative function and the antiderivative function. Through thematic analysis, we identified five types of intra-mathematical connections: procedural, different representations, part-whole, feature, and reversibility, which can serve as a preliminary theoretical framework to study mathematical connections in Calculus in future research; this is a contribution of this research.

With this purpose, the paper reports on mathematization and use of mathematics, and deals with empirical data with focus on modeling activities performed by students in the first year and in the fourth year of a degree in mathematics. After the description of a theoretical framework of modelling, what can be seen by means of a qualitative analysis is that the perception of messy world situations leads to idealization, and the idealized situation acts as the basis for mathematization in each activity. The mathematization in turn leads to different mathematics concepts, tools and procedures. The use of mathematics that students perform is anchored in their previous experiences, be it in their experiences with the concepts and tools of mathematics, or in their experiences with mathematical modeling practices. Besides that, after this process students have advanced and have expanded their knowledge and made significant progress by means of a balance between teacher guidance and students’ independence. Moreover, beyond mathematical knowledge, the research indicated that success in performing modeling activities also requires knowledge-based mathematical modeling anticipation. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2017.",,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This paper reports on a broad project funded by Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq, a public agency that aims to encourage and to finance research in Brazil) and conducted by me and Ph.D. students in the Ph.D. course in Science Teaching and Mathematics Education at a Brazilian university.

Therefore, this research aims to prove that there is anxiety toward math on high school students at a private institution Rioverde in San Luis Potosí, México and find if there is a difference in regards to gender. We used Auzmendi sub-scale questionnaire. The results show that there is anxiety toward math on high school students, and that women show more anxiety toward math than men do.

But, what does efficient exactly mean in that case? And how can teachers reach this objective? The model of Mathematical Working Spaces with its three dimensions—semiotic, instrumental, discursive—allows us to address these questions in an original way based on a multidimensional approach to the use of tools and instruments and on the notion of complete mathematical work. The Mathematical work is considered complete when a genuine relationship exists between epistemological and cognitive aspects, and when the three dimensions of the model are appropriately articulated. Two teaching situations in probability for Grades 9 and 10 (age 14 and 15) are used to illustrate how the model can help identify either misunderstandings that are not acknowledged by the teacher, or complete mathematical work despite some differences between intended and actual work. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Mathematical work; Mathematical Working Spaces; Probability; Tools and instruments",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988354436

Calculus continues to be taught as if it were natural to introduce the study of change and accumulation by means of the formalized ideas and concepts known as the mathematics of ε and δ. It is frequently considered as a failure that “students still seem to conceptualize limits via the imagination of motion.” These kinds of assertions show the tension, the rift created by traditional education between students’ intuitions and a misdirected formalization. In fact, I believe that the internal connections of the intuition of change and accumulation are not correctly translated into that arithmetical approach of ε and δ. There are other routes to formalization which cohere with these intuitions, and those are the ones discussed in this paper.

In particular, considering a mathematical practice as algebraic is based on the intervention of generalization and symbolization processes, along with other objects usually considered as algebraic, such as binary relations, operations, functions and structures. This way to conceive of elementary algebra is based on and compared to the characterizations given by other authors.

The selected lesson allows us to reflect on the instructional process planned by the textbook authors as a means to achieve the students' learning. The following questions guide the textbook analysis: 1) What is the degree of didactical suitability of the planned instructional process? 2) How should we manage the use of the textbook to increase the process suitability?

To tap into their intuitions about fractions, students were presented with pairs of fractions on the screen for a limited time of 10 s. Fraction pairs to be compared were controlled as to whether fractions shared or not a common component (numerator or denominator), as well as whether the greater fraction was the one with greater components or not. Data from about 500 students were processed with a clustering analysis based on these four item types, revealing distinct patterns of answers that we interpret in terms of strategies for answering the task. Half of the sample followed a simple larger-component-larger-fraction strategy as suggested by a congruency-based implementation of the natural number bias, although several clusters showed opposite patterns. These results show that a short, simple task can provide valuable information about students’ individual differences in comparing fractions, useful for both research and practice in mathematics education.

Over the past few years, many researchers have turned to teacher-related variables as a way to better understand classroom processes that may help increase learning levels among students. In this study, we analyze one of these, that falls under what Shulman (Educational Researcher, 15 (2), 4–14, 1986) called pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Specifically, in this study, we analyze one of the areas of PCK which is knowledge of content and students. This was measured through a test where teachers were asked to explain students’ mistakes and predict responses in similar mathematics exercises. We explore if PCK is associated with the socioeconomic status of children and if it has an effect on children’s achievement. Additionally, we analyze which teacher characteristics are associated with higher scores in PCK. The analysis uses the Young Lives longitudinal survey for Peru. We found that students’ socioeconomic status at age 1 and maternal education were positively associated with their teachers’ PCK by the time students were enrolled in fourth grade, thus depicting a very unequal education system. Furthermore, teachers’ PCK was positively associated with student achievement, but only when a threshold for the PCK test was established. For our sample, male teachers, who were younger, and Spanish speakers had higher PCK scores. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Longitudinal study; Mathematics achievement; Pedagogical content knowledge; Peru; Socioeconomic status",,"Department for International Development, UK Government, DFID","Preparation of this study was funded by UK aid from the Department for International Development (DFID) and co-funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2010 to 2014 and by Irish Aid from 2014 to 2015.

The design of the teaching experiment articulates the static perspective of exponential covariation and a reformulation for the discrete case of the dynamic perspective of the covariation. The static perspective considers that amounts of one quantity varying in arithmetic progression are associated or juxtaposed with amounts of another quantity varying in geometric progression. On the other hand, the dynamic perspective coordinates two varying quantities while attending the ways in which they change in relation to each other. The conceptual framework also takes into account the results of previous epistemological-historical studies about the development of the concepts of exponential and logarithmic functions. The data analysis aims to define the logarithmic-exponential covariational reasoning of the participants through the identification of the mental actions and levels of reasoning achieved during the teaching experiment. The results show that the teaching experiment contributed to the students' perception of the changes in the involved variables and to infer the juxtaposition of the operations: ""multiplying by adding"" and ""divide by subtracting"".

Despite the interaction with the entity to be modeled is necessary, its adequacy comes about with the intervention on it, through carrying out activity with the model. It is through this intervention that the modeling act is established. Articulating different models with the phenomenon, gives rise to a modeling network that strengthen the human activity for the intervention. © 2015, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

However, in general, in the educational system, formal construction processes and algorithmic aspects have been prioritized. Seeking to answer this problem, an investigation addressing the study of the derivative was started. The work was framed from the perspective of Variational Thought and Language, which studies the relationship between research and social practices that rules the mathematics of change and variation in educational systems. In a didactic engineering context, a sequence was designed and presented in a Mathematics II class attended by Agricultural Engineering students. The activities made it possible to analyse different scenarios of variation (which magnitudes change, how and how much they change), characterize variations between magnitudes, through the calculation of rates of change, and explore how the slope of a curve is related to the rate of change. Its presentation from different representations contributes to the development of one of the cognitive processes involved in mathematical thinking: visualization. In this article, the theoretical and methodological aspects that support the design of the sequence are briefly described, and some results of its implementation from the observation of the activities developed by the students are presented. The proposal managed to motivate students. The discussion of the results will contribute to the optimization of the sequence.","Derivative; Learning; Teaching; Variational thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901951221

It is organized around two basic questions: what are we talking about when we refer to mathematics that teachers need to know well for teaching? Which educational practices can contribute to the appropriation of this fundamental mathematics by future teachers for their professional work? To find the answers, different social practices of mathematics educators were problematized seeking clues in those practices regarding the kind of mathematical knowledge required and mobilized in their work. After that, some historical attempts to address the problem of mathematical education of teachers were reviewed, with Felix Klein, Richard Courant and Bento de Jesus Caraça as references, and some Brazilian and international research regarding the training of mathematics teachers. Based on these studies, this article highlights the existence, in the initial training of mathematics teachers, of a quasi trichotomy among academic mathematics, didactic-pedagogic content and teaching practice in schools. To break with this trichotomic tradition some changes are suggested regarding the practice and research on teacher education. For example, teacher training in mathematics must be guided by the different social practices of mathematics educators. These practices can to be adopted in training and projects in which undergraduates can to be integrated, making contrasts, discussions and investigations about the relationships among their undergraduate training in mathematics, their pedagogical-didactic training related to the content, and the complexity of school practices.","Educational Practices; Mathematics Degree; Mathematics for Teaching; Mathematics Teacher Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893666520

These foundations are broadly described by the term relational thinking. In this exploratory study of the mathematical thinking of a selection of Year 7 and Year 8 students in Brazil, we found that when students were asked to solve numerical expressions using four arithmetic operations, most students opted for computational methods. However, when required to show relational thinking, most students did so, but clearly needed further support in this respect.","Algebraic thinking; Curriculum reform; Implications for teaching; Justification; Relational thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870281166

In the inclusive mathematics classroom, teachers are faced with the complex and formidable task of designing and organizing learning activities for learners who face a variety of different challenges. In this article, we focus on the blind mathematics learner. In our view, in order to construct a more inclusive mathematics education, it is necessary to understand the particularities of the learning processes of learners with limited or no access to the visual field. To this end, in this paper we present our attempts to elaborate materials which permit the tactile exploration of geometrical figures, so that blind learners might build understandings of the areas, perimeters and volume of a range of geometrical shapes. We describe the interactions of the students with the materials, with each other and with the teacher, giving special attention the mathematical dialogues and gestures which emerged during tasks resolution.","Blind Learners; Geometry; Mathematics Education; Special Education; Tactile Tool",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960271821

One occurred during the mid-twentieth century, while the other connected to the Movimento Sem Terra (Landless Movement), a national social movement, emerged 25 years ago precisely in this part of the country. The study analyzes two events of those forms of life: imposing the Portuguese language on the German colonization schools during the time of the Nationalization Campaign (1939-1945) and the closing of the itinerant schools of the Landless Movement that happened recently. Using Later Wittgenstein ideas, some language games that constitute school mathematics and peasant mathematics in those two forms of life are described. Based on this description articulated with the discussion about Hardt and Negri's notion of differential inclusion, it is argued that school mathematics in those two different time-space forms of life works as a gear in the production of differential inclusion. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Differential inclusion; Foucaultian genealogy; German colonization school mathematics; Later Wittgenstein; MST mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960254537

We observe that resorting to the history of the genesis of knowledge has permitted the identification of a variable in the mathematical content of the curriculum which influences the acquisition of the notions and procedures of calculus. At some point, the what to teach becomes part of how to teach and from there mathematics activity takes on a didactic sense in the classroom.

An experiment was carried out in which children had to order three sets of blue and pink marbles according to their degree of chance of drawing a target colour. Neither age group had received any previous instruction in probability. The task in this experiment was opened to solutions in terms of part-part or part-whole comparisons. We tested the idea that children would solve the tasks by using part-part relations to estimate probability rather than part-whole comparisons. The analysis of children's strategies and their verbal justifications revealed that children ignored the role played by the possible cases by making correct ordering on the basis of part-part relations in which they made comparisons between favourable and unfavourable cases in each set of marbles. The results support the findings reported by Spinillo and Bryant (1991, 1999) on proportional reasoning, and the idea claimed by Resnick and Singer (1993) and Singer, Kohn, and Resnick (1997) about the early intuitive origins of relational concepts termed protoquantitative schemes.

Based on a literature review, it explains what replication studies are, and why they are important for our field. It also addresses the issue of why, despite their apparent importance, replication studies remain scarce. Some open discussions about replication studies in mathematics education are pointed out, and a couple of issues related to replication studies whose empirical exploration could help to advance our research field are identified. Additionally, a typology of fundamental questions and modes of exploration that could guide a replication study in mathematics education is proposed.

Results showed that teachers’ traditional beliefs are directly associated with their teacher-centered practices, while there was an indirect relation among reformed beliefs and student-centered practices through teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and their beliefs about the value of problem solving.

The system consolidated three types of schools: public, subsidized private, and private schools. Public schools are managed and funded by local county government, subsidized private schools are managed by private entities but receive public funding, and private schools are managed by private entities and financed by students’ families and sometimes private organizations. This market-oriented educational system generates competition among schools, especially among public and subsidized schools for public funds distributed through a voucher-like mechanism (Bellei & Vanni, 2015) forcing them to compete for students. To stimulate the Brational selection^ of schools, the National School Assessment System (SIMCE) was created, with national tests that measure curricular objectives as established by the Ministry of Education (Bellei & Morawietz, 2016). The test assesses mathematics, language (Spanish), and other subject areas for 4th graders every year and alternating year for 8th and 12th graders. In the post-dictatorship era, some changes were introduced to the system to compensate the Bdynamic of the market^ with some policies for equity and school improvement.

In this study, we develop a framework for mathematics e-textbook analysis, based on the notion of “connectivity.” We introduce criteria to assess the different aspects of connectivity and build an analysis grid for e-textbooks. We illustrate the framework proposed by analyzing 2 commonly used French grade 10 mathematics e-textbooks. The results of the analyses show that there are major differences between the 2 e-textbooks in terms of connectivity, which can be related to differences in their design.

The mathematical modelling of successive variation in mathematics and science is addressed through the interpretation of graphs in two cases of different nature: the diagnosis of a cardiologist on the health of a patient (a non-deterministic phenomenon) and the arguments of high school students facing the task of filling containers (a deterministic phenomenon). An emerging theory in the field of mathematics education—the socioepistemological theory—explains the problem of construction of mathematical knowledge. The constructs of this theory are elaborated with an empirical basis; and the legitimacy of all forms of knowledge is assumed, be this knowledge popular, technical or scientific, since all of them constitute human wisdom.

Theories are interpreted as research praxeologies, and different modalities of “dialogues” between research praxeologies are proposed, based on alternatively considering the main features and proposals of one theory from the perspective of the other. To illustrate this networking methodology, we initiate a dialogue between APOS (action-process-object-schema) and the ATD itself. It starts from the theoretical component of both research praxeologies followed by the technological and technical ones. Both dialogue modalities and the resulting insights are illustrated, and the elements of APOS and the ATD that the dialogue can promote and develop are underlined.

Three groups of students in two different schools in the city of Puebla, Mexico, were followed from the last year of primary school (Year 6) to the second year of their secondary education (Year 8). Learning was characterised as the ongoing structural change that allows individuals or groups to act effectively in a changing environment [Maturana (GAIA, a way of knowing: political implications of the new biology. Lindisfarne, New York, pp 65–82, 1987)]. An enactivist methodology, which revolves around the idea of research being a form of learning [Reid (Proceedings of the 20th conference of the international group for the psychology of mathematics education. PME, Valencia, pp 203–209, 1996)], implied that, as I carried out the study, what I was doing was learning about how people learn algebra. My initial questions arose from my experiences with the teaching and learning of mathematics, which gave me a sense of the complexity involved in the learning processes. Later, as I became immersed in the process of investigation of the teaching and learning of algebra, my conceptions continually evolved. The meaning of the phrase ‘algebraic learning’, which I used as a way of maintaining a wide perspective that allowed me to explore the events in the classroom in a complex way, arose as I engaged with enactivist ideas about learning, with the research literature on the learning of algebra, in conversations with people and in interactions with the participants of my project. I went through a process of continual development and change which I describe in this paper. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Algebraic learning; Enactivism",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939651801

We argue that such a path is crucial for helping students develop deep quantitative understandings of fractions, where fraction quantities are, from the very start, linked to the reciprocal and multiplicative relations that their use implies.

In order to initiate the conceptions reorganization, an initial activity was made in the graphic frame; it seems optimal to start the debates without leading participants to failure. The mathematical core of the workshop was formed by an algebraic method to find tangents to algebraic curves which is close to Descartes' method. The ACODESA methodology allowed some intense debates mainly concerning the local character of a tangent, generating the teachers' cognitive unbalance which is a starting point for the refinement or transformation of their conceptions.

There were clear differences between the two groups of students in their preference for external representations, in their understanding of the kind of answers they were expected to produce and in the way they conceived the role of mathematics in the practice of science. Although students' preferences for a particular representation were not significantly modified by the use of a spreadsheet as a modelling resource, at the end of the study the students recognised the value of using a more diverse set of representations.

By introducing a concept of culture which calls for an analysis of individual and social behaviours, we are lead to recognize ‘ethnomathematics’ as a form of structured knowledge and to recognize ‘matheracy’ as a characteristic behaviour of human beings. Upon these two concepts, we introduce a theoretical framework for curriculum development in mathematics. Curricular space is conceptualized as a three-dimensional space with components, contents, methods and objectives considered solidarily. This relies upon an epistemology of action, based on an integration of episteme, techne and praxis. This allows for an approach in which theory and practice are in a dialectical relationship.

This change will be analyzed by looking at three trends in mathematics education: the use of digital technology, philosophy of mathematics education, and critical mathematics education. Digital technology became a trend in mathematics education in response to the arrival of a different kind of artifact to the mathematics classroom. It was thrust into the spotlight as the pandemic suddenly moved classrooms online around the world. Challenges specific to mathematics education in this context must be addressed. The link between the COVID-19 pandemic and digital technology in education also raises epistemological issues highlighted by philosophy of mathematics education and critical mathematics education. Using the notion that the basic unit of knowledge production throughout history is humans-with-media, I discuss how humans are connected to the virus, how it has laid bare social inequality, and how it will change the agendas of these three trends in mathematics education. I highlight the urgent need to study how mathematics education happens online for children when the home environment and inequalities in access to digital technologies assume such significant roles as classes move on-line. We need to understand the political role of agency of artifacts such as home in collectives of humans-with-media-things, and finally we need to learn how to implement curricula that address social inequalities.

For this purpose we focus on the emblematic case of an experienced mathematics teacher at secondary level, Anna, who has also worked as a teacher educator in a university department. Using the lens of the Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD), we investigate her case, with a particular interest in digital resources, including both digital curriculum resources (e.g., e-textbooks, online resources) and digital technologies (e.g., for communicating, sharing). Two notions appear essential for supporting this investigation: the notion of resource system for studying the teacher’s activity as a whole, and the notion of documentational trajectory for studying the teacher’s activity over the time. Methodologically, specific tools were developed for gaining deeper insights into the teacher’s resource system, or her documentational trajectory. This study provides a window into mathematics teacher use and design of digital/non-digital resources in/for their teaching. Moreover, it helps us to develop better understandings of teacher professional learning over time, and of the ways the context of collaboration shapes their professional work and learning. More and also contrasting cases (e.g., of newly qualified teachers) would need to be studied to fully understand this field. © 2020, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Digital resources; Documentational approach to didactics; Documentational trajectory; Resource system; Teachers’ collective work; Teachers’ professional development",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085707565

Following this line of research, the present study is based in the Mathematics Teacher’s Specialized Knowledge (MTSK) model, which includes two domains of knowledge, namely, mathematical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Through an instrumental case study, classroom observation, and a semi-structured interview, we inquire how the knowledge of practices in mathematics, one of the subdomains of mathematical knowledge, is related to the pedagogical content knowledge of a lecturer in a real analysis course. The results show relationships between these subdomains considering their nature of support or conditioning. In this regard, the lecturer’s knowledge of practices in mathematics conditions his/her knowledge of mathematics teaching (e.g. techniques, metaphors, and analogies). So, a lecturer’s teaching goal is that students, in addition to understanding the mathematical contents, learn how to think mathematically to validate and construct arguments. Additionally, a lecturer’s knowledge of students’ weaknesses in carrying out proofs and working with quantifiers is supported by his/her knowledge of practice in mathematics (e.g. different methods of proofs and statements with quantifiers, as well as their meaning). In this respect, the nature of relationships between two or three subdomains of the MTSK model contributes to understanding how the lecturer’s knowledge is integrated and is a good starting point for investigating the development of lecturers’ mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Knowledge of practices in mathematics; Mathematics lecturer; Mathematics teacher’s specialized knowledge model; Pedagogical content knowledge; Real analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065016078

For this, a design-based research methodology was used. A hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT) was applied, created within the framework of this heuristic. The results provide evidence that the emergent models heuristic support the construction of these concepts of Linear Algebra.

Pre-service teachers developed these projects within a regular mathematics education course during the teacher education program at the university concerned. This environment, called a modelling scenario, is the context for our study, which is based on the analysis of projects produced by seven consecutive cohorts of pre-service teachers beginning in 2010. The research questions guiding our study seek to determine which technologies pre-service teachers chose, for which modelling purposes they chose them, and in which phases of the modelling process they were significantly used. During the modelling process, pre-service teachers used the Internet, spreadsheets, mathematical software and programming languages. The Internet, the most utilized technology, was used to find information or data, to select variables, or to formulate problems. The other three technologies significantly influenced the processes of mathematical solution and validation. The in-depth analysis of a single project shows an original use of visual affordances of technologies and a dialectical relationship between problem posing and technology use. The study enables us to conclude the necessity for coordinated action between mathematics educators and mathematicians to generate a deeper understanding of modelling as a pedagogical proposal and mathematical activity. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2018.","Digital technologies; Mathematical modelling scenario; Pre-service mathematics teachers",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055720479

Previously, these mathematics teacher education students had no opportunity to study in higher education in Brazil. They were enrolled in a Mathematical Modelling course, as part of the Universidade Aberta do Brasil (UAB), which is the Brazilian open university, at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP). All stages of this study were performed in accordance with case study methodological procedures, which covered data collection and analysis. The interpretation of the results was accomplished through the development of categories, which emerged from collected qualitative data at the completion of the fieldwork. These procedures helped the researchers to answer the research question: How can technological resources available in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) help students to interact and collaboratively develop mathematical modelling projects that assist them in solving problems they face in daily life? One important claim for mathematical modelling in a VLE is to favor the development of students in their interaction and collaboration in solving problems they face daily, by elaborating modelling projects through the use of technological resources available in this environment. By developing these projects, students learned to problematize, contextualize, and investigate problems. As well, they prepared questions that aimed to seek, collect, select, organize, and handle the information that allowed them to reflect critically about the role of mathematics in their own context. The results from this study show that the development of modelling projects in a VLE helped students to interact and collaboratively inquire and investigate their chosen theme in accordance with their own interests and reality. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2018.","Case study; Mathematical modelling; Mathematical models; Modelling projects; Virtual learning environments",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053451411

This proposal responds to a need, identified in the literature, for “further research which uses alternative methods to understand student perspectives more fully, particularly in the context of innovative task design” (Ainley and Margolinas, Task design in mathematics education, Springer, Switzerland, 2015, p. 20). Influenced by enactivism, classroom cultures are characterised through patterns in students’ effective behaviours. Mathematics learning is defined as changes in effective behaviours which result from noticing features such as mathematical structure and which allow the learner to act differently in a given mathematical context. The following aspects were used as starting points to explore students’ behaviours and to characterise different cultures: active/passive, attentive/inattentive, working with others/working individually, freedom/constraint, giving correct answers/formulating explanations, knowing how and knowing why/remembering. Examples from two large-scale Mexican projects show how different tasks emerge in different contexts and how this emergence is interconnected with different patterns in effective behaviours and with mathematics learning. Characterising classroom cultures and sharing different ways of working in the classroom, which might give rise to different tasks, are offered as possibilities for taking students’ and teachers’ perspectives more fully into account in task design. © 2017, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Enactivism; Mathematical tasks; Mathematics classroom culture; Mathematics learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043225328

Focus group interviews were carried out until theoretical saturation of the data was achieved (N = 53 in nine focus groups interviews). Data analysis is based on the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies eliciting situations for each emotion and the variables that affect intensity. The emotional experiences in this structure are as follows: satisfaction, disappointment, hope, fear, joy, distress, boredom, interest, pride, reproach, self-reproach, like and dislike.

Recent evaluations show that, for most students, it is still difficult to learn these objects of knowledge, which is an actual indicator that more didactic research should be made in order to come up with new ways to understand these problem areas. This way, it could have a great impact on the educational system. In this article, we revise and we make comments on some of the recent research on ratio, proportion and proportionality. According to an analysis perspective, we classify them into three groups: the cognitive and the epistemic perspective, and the semiotic-anthropological one.

In the second section, we provide a synthesis of the perspectives presented in four papers, written as contributions to the debate that took place in the meeting. Finally, in the third section, we outline a theoretical framework that serves as the basis for situating the fundamental ideas in the development of the debate on the theme over the past three decades.

We use the theoretical perspective of the documentational approach that focuses, in this case, on the interaction between teacher educators and the resources they use for their online training work. We thus study the following issues: (1) What kinds of resources do online teacher educators need, and how are such resources modified according to the educators’ specific skills and needs? (2) What specific skills are needed for setting up online training for mathematics teachers and how do these skills evolve as teacher education resources are used? We consider both questions simultaneously, while presenting results from a study within a specific teacher training programme in France that proposes ‘‘training paths’’ on a national platform. These ‘‘paths’’ are resources designed for teacher educators. We follow the appropriation of two training paths by two educator teams. The ways in which these educator teams were able to appropriate the paths give insights into the teacher educators’ skills and, as well, into the resources they need. By looking at their use of resources (as online mathematics teacher educators), we observe and analyse professional geneses, leading to the development of new skills. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2012.","Documentational approach; Dynamic geometry; Individualisation; Investigation; Mathematics teacher education; Online resources; Online teacher education; Teacher educators’ professional knowledge; Training path",,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 234870",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902658090

Within these rankings, Ibero-American journals have had little—to almost no—presence. This raises awareness on the current state of journal indexes and on what these indexes do and how they have been used in constituting sites of exclusion within the mathematics education community. We contend that ranking systems are perceived as the philosopher’s stone of academia, in the sense that they have the ability to convert any material (an article, a journal, the academic production of a scholar) into a precious material within the academic world. This alchemic move not only exacerbates exclusion, but also configures a point system that constitutes places for enjoyment and fetishistic disavowal within researchers. Thus, we want to challenge the assumption that mainstream journal rankings are able to accurately reflect the quality, impact, and reputation of mathematics education journals by taking as “empirical data” the Ibero-American journals in the field of mathematics education. In problematizing journal ranking effects in the production, dissemination, and socialization of knowledge, we seek to open a discussion regarding the economic-political dynamics that govern publishing practices in mathematics education and that are entangled in the production of knowledge in our discipline. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Enjoyment; Exclusion; Fetishistic disavowal; Journal indexing; Ranking effects",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082922903

Using the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, this qualitative case study research starts filling this gap by pursuing the following goals: (1) identify the daily discrete emotions in classroom of a high school mathematics teacher, (2) identify the situations that trigger those emotions, and (3) identify the appraisal structure that supports those emotions. Data was gathered through audiotaped self-reports in which the participating teacher reported his emotional experiences during 13 mathematics classes and one interview performed after the receipt of all self-reports. Our results show that the teacher participant experienced diverse emotions, such as satisfaction, disappointment, appreciation, happy-for, sorry-for, reproach, and anger. The triggering situations for the cognitive appraisals are about the achievement of the planned activities for the lessons and student learning. The support of the appraisals is the participants’ belief that the “good attitude” of students—students’ “collaboration,” “independence,” and “participation”—is a necessary condition to achieve participant’s goals in class and for the students to learn. Our results are, in general, consistent with the research on emotions of teachers from elementary to high-school levels which shows that students’ behavior in the classroom has an important impact on teachers’ emotional experiences. We propose the hypothesis, for future research, that the emotional experiences of other mathematics teachers in classroom are triggered by the perceived mathematical behavior and the perceived mathematical learning of their students. © 2018, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Cognitive appraisal; Experience-sampling method; Mathematics teachers’ emotions; Teachers’ goals",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042358025

The results obtained for the RMARS scale are: Bartlett's Test of Sphericity with KMO (0.689), χ 2 of 603.529 with 3 df and sig. 0.000 p &lt; 0.00, MSA Measure of Sampling Adequacy all more than &gt; 0.5, with an eigenvalue (2.219) which explains the 73.955 % of the total variance.

Results show how the course's features contributed to the development of this teacher's specific fractions knowledge, knowledge of fractions and students, and of fractions and teaching. © Authors.","Fractions; Mathematical knowledge for teaching; Peer discussion; Problem solving; Teacher professional development",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 3140597, EDU2011-29328, EDU2015-65270-R; Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDEF: ID4I10338; China Institute of Atomic Energy, CIAE: FB 0003","This research was supported by the projects: CMM Basal, CIAE Project FB 0003 from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT, Fondecyt 3140597, EDU2011-29328 and EDU2015-65270-R projects and FONDEF project ID4I10338.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014793139

Some MWS elements are independent of the field while other elements must be adapted to the field in question. In this paper, we develop the MWS model for the field of analysis with an identification of paradigms. We show the advantages of this MWS model, which takes into account the epistemological and cognitive aspects of mathematical work, and more specifically the semiotic, instrumental and discursive geneses, by making them function as one system. By using examples and data from three countries, we illustrate how this model can be used to perform a priori analyses and analyses of class situations and individual student work. © 2016, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Analysis; Mathematical working space; Paradigms; Perspectives",,"C13H03","This study was supported by the ECOS-Sud C13H03 project.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988448011

We conjectured a small number of mental constructions, (genetic decomposition) which seem to play a key role in student understanding of these functions. To test and refine the conjecture we held semi-structured interviews with eleven students who had just completed a traditional college trigonometry course. A detailed analysis of the interviews shows that the conjecture is useful in describing student behavior in problem solving situations. Results suggest that students having a process conception of the conjectured mental constructions can perform better in problem solving activities.

The students’ mastery of digital tools allowed them to use and articulate different mathematical representations to comprehend how phenomena develop. The use of digital tools helped to enhance the students’ interpretation of the relationships between the context and the mathematical model associated with it. We also found that difficulties related to interpretation are grounded in the literal relationship that students make between their mental model of how a phenomenon develops and its mathematical representations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","digital tools; mathematical models; ordinary differential equations; representation registers",,"169440",,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946494217

With this aim in view, an online repository/platform was developed to gather various dynamic geometry resources, based on the idea of a teachers' community feeding the repository, (re)using available resources and sharing practices related to the use of dynamic geometry in classrooms. The repository is thus open to contributions of any user who can deposit, browse, download and use resources, which naturally raises the question how to handle the resource quality issue in such an open environment. This paper reports on the way we tackled this issue in the Intergeo project. We first explain what we mean by a ""good quality"" dynamic geometry resource. We then provide a rationale behind the design of a questionnaire, the main tool for resource quality reviews, which are at the core of the quality assessment process implemented in the repository. Several experiments carried out with groups of teachers in order to confront our research-based view of the resource quality with the teachers' one and to observe teachers' usages of the quality assessment process are also reported in the paper. The outcomes of these experiments highlight strengths and limitations of the resource quality assessment process. They also tend to show that the idea of involving teachers into the resource quality assessment is a promising way of stimulating the use of dynamic geometry in classrooms, provided that teachers benefit from a support to make the quality process their own. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2011.","Dynamic geometry; i2geo platform; Pedagogical resource; Quality assessment process",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867480773

The papers for this special issue focus mainly on this period. During these years, many trends have emerged in mathematics education to address the complex problems facing Brazilian society. However, most Brazilian mathematics educators feel that the separation of research into trends is a theoretical idealization that does not respond to the dynamics of the problems we face. We raise the conjecture that the complexity of Brazilian society, where pockets of wealth coexist with the most shocking poverty, has contributed to the adoption and generation of different strands in mathematics education, crossing the boundaries between trends. At a more micro level, we also raise the conjecture that Brazilian trends in research are interwoven because of the way that Brazilian mathematics educators have experienced the process of globalization over these 30 years. This tapestry of trends is a predominant characteristic of mathematics education in Brazil. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Ethnomathematics; History of mathematics education; Information and communication technologies; Modeling; Philosophy of mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867566759

First, mathematics can picture a crisis. This is in accordance with the classic interpretation of mathematical modelling, which highlights that a mathematical model provides a representation of a piece of reality, a reality that could be a critical situation such as, for instance, a pandemic. Second, mathematics can constitute a crisis, meaning that mathematics can form an intrinsic part of the very dynamics of a crisis. This phenomenon can be illustrated by the economic crises that spread around the world in 2008. Third, mathematics can format a crisis. This final formulation refers to a situation where a mathematical reading of a crisis brings about ways of acting in the critical situation that might be adequate, but also counterproductive, if not catastrophic. This is illustrated with reference to the potential crises due to climate changes. As a conclusion, the paper addresses the politics of crises, which refers to the power that can be acted out through a crisis discourse in which mathematics may come to play a deplorable role. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Mathematics constituting a crisis; Mathematics formatting a crisis; Mathematics picturing a crisis; Politics of crises",,,"I want to thank Richard Barwell, Arindam Bose, Ana Carolina Faustino, Peter Gates, Brian Greer, David Kollosche, Amanda Queiroz Moura, Miriam Godoy Penteado, and Guilherme Henrique Gomes da Silva for their helpful comments and suggestions.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101259002

Also, the face-to-face component of this instruction modality allows spontaneous communication and collaborative construction of knowledge in real settings.

We focus on the mathematics textbook assessments, describing their evolution and commenting on some of their accomplishments and problems. The first assessment was carried out for the 1997 school year and retained basically its initial formulation, with changes and improvements, til the assessment for the 2018 school year. As of now, the program is undergoing substantial changes which are briefly discussed and which worry many educators. This assessment was responsible for a definite improvement of mathematics textbooks for elementary, middle and high schools in Brazil. It constitutes a good example of a successful program, coordinated by competent persons from mathematics education, schools of education and mathematics departments of good universities, at first without political interference, and strongly backed by powerful officials in MEC.

The introduction of these concepts is generally based on the study of classical examples from Newtonian mechanics supplemented with a control system. Equilibrium and stability are approached in different ways at the various stages of a typical engineering syllabus: at the beginning, they are mostly dealt with a static point of view, for example in mechanics, and are subsequently handled through dynamic analysis in control courses. In general, there is a little clarification of the differences between these concepts or the ways in which they are linked. We believe that this leads to much confusion and incomprehension among engineering students. Several studies have shown that students encounter difficulties when presented with simple familiar or academic static equilibrium cases in mechanics. Our study investigates students’ conceptions and misconceptions about equilibrium and stability through a series of questions about several innovative non-static situations. It reveals that the understanding of these notions is shaken when the systems being studied are placed in inertial or non-inertial moving reference frames. The students in our study were particularly uncertain about the existence of unstable equilibrium positions and had difficulty in differentiating between the two concepts. The results suggest that students use a velocity-based approach to explain such situations. A poor grasp of the above fundamental concepts may result from previous learning experiences. More specifically, certain difficulties seem to be directly linked to a lack of understanding of these concepts, while others are related to misconceptions arising from everyday experiences and the inappropriate use of physical examples in primary school. © 2015, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","conceptions; equilibrium; stability; students’ way of thinking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028227341

The term stochastic has been used to refer to the interrelationship of the concepts of combinatorics, probability and statistics. Although the study emphasized the teaching and learning of probability and statistics, this text describes the activities related to the probabilistic study. The research was qualitative, with interpretive analysis based on categories that emerged from the empirical part: simulation, interaction and problem-solving. The analytic process converged with the preparation of a case study of a group of four students with whom the activities were developed, and the following problem was investigated: how can technology resources be useful for the construction of new knowledge about stochastic in the elementary school? To answer this question we used Vygotsky's perspective, considering that learning activities can promote learning through internalization. Thus, the process focused on the interaction having the collective dimension and the support of technological resources.

Having detected this situation, the researchers coached him, focusing on his emotional and mathematical knowledge. After this coaching, Diego managed to overcome his mathematics anxiety and enjoyed teaching mathematics. Cases like Diego’s are common among novice teachers in Mexico; they are more likely to experience negative emotions despite doing their best for their students. His case can also show us a path for the relief of negative emotions.

An understanding of slope is needed at the university level since slope plays an important role in understanding problems involving variation and change. In this study Mexican curricula documents were examined to determine which conceptualizations of slope are addressed in the intended mathematics curriculum. To explain the results, we use conceptualizations of slope identified in previous research. Our findings reveal that, to a certain extent, the conceptualizations proposed in the Mexican intended mathematics curriculum differ slightly in terms of the emphasis and timing of instruction from what others have identified in the U.S., with slope as a geometric ratio receiving less emphasis in the Mexican curriculum. There was also noted discontinuity within the Mexican curriculum in introducing slope in grade 9 and subsequently introducing of linear functions in grade 10 without explicit mention of slope.

The article brings together for the first time findings already reported in the literature from the first two research cycles, and the results of the third and final cycle.

We turned to policy and institutional practices to understand the disability discourses that were evident. Teachers called on medical and deficit discourses to produce these students as abnormal and problematic in their learning of mathematics. Yet teachers also blurred the lines of categorisation between and within labels of special needs, including other students in these terms. Simultaneously, the reform PD created space for a counter discourse of ability.

We undertook a classical thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews held with 10 primary school teachers 18 months after their participation in PD. We present an innovative report of our findings by combining the interview analysis into a movie synopsis and creating a fictional protagonist, Tia (‘aunty’ in Spanish), who represents the common findings from the ten teachers. We found the attractive identities performed by teachers, in particular the ‘mother-saviour’ and the ‘successful’ teacher, conflicted with their understandings of the teacher role promoted by PD. We argue the unique method of combining data allowed for reporting findings with both breadth and depth and this enabled us to see the way in which identities are culturally and contextually produced. We suggest PD needs to cater to these attractive teacher identities in order to be successful and sustainable in the long term. © 2019, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Discourse; Fiction; Identity; Narrative; Professional development",,"FB0003; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: 3160469, 3180291; China Institute of Atomic Energy, CIAE: AFB170001","Acknowledgements We wish to acknowledge the following funding sources: CONICYT Proyectos Fondecyt Post-doctorado #3160469 and #3180291; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 (CIAE) and AFB170001 (CMM) and Unité Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060137971

The MRBQ is an instrument for assessing student mathematics-related beliefs, originally developed at the University of Leuven (Belgium) and validated in several countries. The instrument was administered to 670 students, from public high schools in Medellín (Colombia). The analyses revealed that these student mathematics-related beliefs are better represented with a ten-factor model, rather than with a four-factor model as suggested in previous studies of the MRBQ. The 10 factors explain more faithfully the original theoretical model and account for a variance of 56.34%, higher than that obtained in previous research. These results not only suggest significant improvements of the MRBQ, but also provide the basis for developing a reliable tool to assess beliefs in the Colombian context. To what these authors know, a consistent instrument has not been designed yet in this context for identifying beliefs, and consequently studying their influence on the learning of mathematics. © 2019 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

By adapting elements of the theoretical and methodological framework called Abstraction in Context (AiC), participants’ discussions while building a mathematical model—in a nested epistemic actions—are analysed. Two specific points are discussed in this paper. The first aims to identify how different types of knowledge emerge when an individual is faced with a modelling task. The second is regarding the use of auxiliary material as a means of metaphorising a situation. It was evidenced how the material favours the construction of a mathematical model through the simplification and idealisation that it brings. The meaning constructed for the model is supported in recognising a decreasing behaviour as a part of a whole. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Abstraction in context; Auxiliary material; Interpreting; Mathematical knowledge building; Modelling",,"3150317; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1151093, PUCV DI 039.330/2016","This work was supported by CONICYT/FONDECYT/POSDOCTORADO/No.3150317.

A grounded theory approach was used to examine participants' behaviors and attitudes in college mathematics courses, their mathematics self-efficacy beliefs, and how these beliefs aligned with their mathematics competence. Interview participants reported relatively high mathematics self-efficacy, but many revealed a mismatch between their mathematics self-efficacy beliefs and mathematics competence levels. Participants who had a balance between these two factors reported being more likely to spend extra time working to overcome their mathematics deficiencies and seeking extra help. However, participants with a mismatch reported being more likely to procrastinate and put little effort into improving their mathematics competence, blaming external factors for their struggles.

This qualitative study was developed with the children of Group 3 in the Federal University of Bahia day-care center, through the implementation of task sequences. The results showed that, overall, the task's sequences had a level of didactic suitability from medium-high to high and, although they did not reach a high level of suitability, they played a coherent interrelationship, contributing with a favorable course of approach for the children, with important notions for the development of space perception, showing, as a whole, the potential of the designed tasks and, therefore, the suitable character of the proposal. Specifically, the mediational criterion, which concerns, for example, material resources, ended up functioning as a learning boundary, since it was a distractor, diverting children's attention to other learning objectives. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The researchers took a qualitative approach, analyzing discursive manifestations in the modeling process. In the discussion, contradictions emerged in the group through events such as dilemma and conflict. The results indicate that the modeling task acted as an artifact that brought to light inner contradictions, and thus, allowed teachers to move from a conflict to the formulation of an open problem, and from a dilemma to the construction of a model and a pedagogic strategy. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2017.","Cultural-historical activity theory; Mathematical modelling; Mathematics teacher education; Online distance learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046550122

Thirty-nine public school teachers (1st to 9th grade) were asked to formulate mathematical problems which resolution would involve multiplication and division. The results have shown that teachers understand what a multiplicative situation is and can formulate verbal problems appropriately. There were only a few cases where relevant information was omitted, or which contained language-related inaccuracies. It was also found that most of the problems were of the same type, and that their resolution required only one step. This lack of variety was observed among all teachers, regardless of the grade they taught. Thus, it has been concluded that teachers have difficulties in posing problems that make use of the various situations characteristic of the multiplicative structures field. It is, therefore, crucial to develop the elementary school teachers' ability to pose problems.","Elementary school teachers; Multiplicative structure; Posing mathematical problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040462752

We use the parameters of the financial mathematics of Puccini (2007). We refer to several academics, members of the research group in Financial Mathematics as support for financial education and decision making, from Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF), which is coordinated by Dr. Marco Aurélio Kistemann Junior. The explored contents of mathematics were functions and progressions, with an interdisciplinary approach. The subjects were high school students in basic education. Five activities were built with problems, approaching concepts, and financial calculations, from subjects such as savings and financing. Here, we present the analysis of two questions from activities one and two. Through the analysis of errors, a continuous improvement of the student's reflexive posture was evidenced, not only in the resolution of the financial problems by the calculations made, but also in the interpretation of the propositions under study. The results, resolutions, and interpretations obtained, confirmed the efficiency of the methodology used.","Financial education; Financial mathematics; Solving problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030774434

The dialogue practice of the prospective teachers was followed and the episodes from those practices constituted a first level of data. In moments of supervision and pedagogical imagination, the prospective teachers reflected on such episodes and their conversation constituted data about data. An episode about a prospective teacher's attempt to put the dialogue in action with her students is presented.

Considering factors relating to the understanding of mathematical modeling and light aspects of Peirce's theory, we look at the development of a modeling activity performed by students in a chemistry course during CDI classes. The analysis of the action and production of signs in the activity indicates that the semiosis as an action that involves sign, object, and interpretant is not limited. Instead, this action and production revealed that the phenomenon and mathematics are inseparable and that seems to be set up as a network in which signs are produced or driven by knowledge and generate new knowledge. In this network, we can characterize a structure that combines mathematical knowledge, knowledge of the problem under study, and technological knowledge.","Knowledge; Mathematical modeling; Semiotics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030775678

This article presents a semiotic analysis of significant fragments of classroom meaning-making which took place during the class-session in which the existence of the midpoint of a line-segment was proven. The purpose of the analysis is twofold. First follow the evolution of students’ conceptualization when constructing a geometric object that has to satisfy two conditions to guarantee its existence within the Euclidean geometric system. An object must be created satisfying one condition that should lead to the fulfillment of the other. Since the construction is not intuitive it generates a dilemma as to which condition can be validly assigned initially. Usually, the students’ spontaneous procedure is to force the conditions on a randomly chosen object. Thus, the second goal is to highlight the need for the teacher’s mediation so the students understand the strategy to prove existence theorems. In the analysis, we use a model of conceptualization and interpretation based on the Peircean triadic SIGN. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Existence proofs; Meaning-making; Students’ procedure to prove existence theorems; Teacher semiotic-mediation",,"Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS)","Our long-term project was financed by the Colombian national research institute, Colciencias, and Centro de Investigaciones, Universidad Pedagógica Nacional (CIUP).

These perspectives do not distinguish scientific knowledge from religious knowledge but present a hybrid of scientific and religious knowledge. There are scientific inaccuracies in the perspectives, which emphasize biblical arguments over scientific arguments.

The genetic decomposition which was proposed can contribute to help students achieve an understanding of quadratic equations with improved interrelation of ideas and more flexible application of solution methods. Semi-structured interviews with eight beginning undergraduate students explored which of the mental constructions conjectured in the genetic decomposition students could do, and which they had difficulty doing. Two of the mental constructions that form part of the genetic decomposition are highlighted and corresponding further data were obtained from the written work of 121 undergraduate science and engineering students taking a multivariable calculus course.

Influential comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved in these kinds of “imposed-etic approaches,” such as (1) universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the components’ significances, (3) the congruence between languages and conceptions, and (4) the components’ coverage of the phenomena. Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We investigate the premise of universality within the examined components by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is simply unjustifiable. We also thoroughly examined the three other premises underpinning the Western-based imposed-etic perspective. © 2015, Springer Science + Business Media B.V.","cultural comparison; Finland and Chile; imposed-etic approach; mathematics-related affect; young pupils",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949094042

Under the framework of a conceptual framework that articulates cognitive, educational, and social construction of knowledge trigonometric elements, we analyzed the reports submitted by each teacher after the resolution of the problem-situation and some textbooks. We identified that this linear meaning emerges from the activities regulated by the school trigonometric discourse, and is immersed in a phenomenon we call arithmetization of trigonometry.","Mathematic Scholar Discourse; Trigonometric Meaning; Trigonometric Ratio",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920618621

The methodology was quantitative like where we took a sample by groups with a proportional allocation in a random sample. The effective sample was of 625 students which were representative of the area. Our main conclusion is that the students have a basic level of geometric reasoning and they have a low acquisition level in reasoning processes.","Geometric reasoning; Levels of reasoning; Process of reasoning; Secondary education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889688143

It aims to discuss the theoretical and methodological development of this course in teacher education based on the internship experience in statistics courses offered in the second semester of 2008 at the University of Georgia. The proposal of the course is based on the conception that statistics is a science of data analysis and cannot be addressed in a teacher education program as part of applied mathematics. The methodological development of the course focuses on problem solving and the use of technological resources. The results show that the proposed learning activities in the course promote the development of statistical thinking of future mathematics teachers and helps them in their perception regarding the work to be carried out with future students. It is also worth noting the importance of the interaction of future teachers with in-service teachers during the classes.","Education; Mathematics; Statistics; Undergraduate",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893655855

The methodological approach used was action research with the participation of 28 teachers. Lessons were observed and written protocols collected. Analysis of the results revealed the feasibility of the sequence, as the subjects were able to observe, through random experimentation, that the relative frequency is an estimate of the theoretical probability. Comparison of the graphs, on transparencies, allowed the teachers to note the existence of a common pattern that approximates the theoretical probability, allowing an evolution and appropriation of the probability concept. The use of the onto-semiotic technique reveals considerable results for the proposal, as it provides a more careful and detailed look at the object involved in the mathematic activity, leading to an evaluation of the sequence aiming at improved planning, design and efficiency in its use.","Basic education; Didactic sequence; Onto-semiotic approach; Probability teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82355165174

Study 1 explores the effect of inferences, direct or inverse, in the interpretation and construction of graphs. The problems with direct inference were easier than problems with inverse inference. Study 2 investigates difficulties in combinations of problems with positive or negative inclinations and direct or inverse inferences. Students' difficulties with inverse inference problems seem to relate to the use of intuitive rules.

Its scope is limited to the context of school mathematics and, more specifically, to an ongoing research programme which involves the development of collaborative research partnerships with teachers of mathematics. The paper begins with a brief presentation of the introduction of computers into the Brazilian educational scenario in the 1980s, highlighting how computer technology was heralded as a key to permitting new pedagogical approaches appropriate to the constructivist philosophy of that time. It goes on to consider recent developments in the theoretical frameworks used to interpret mathematics learning in the presence of digital technologies and the importance of focusing on the learning system as a whole, considering epistemological, cognitive and pedagogic dimensions concomitantly. In this vein, it is argued that for any real integration to take place, the mathematical practices afforded by digital tools must be considered legitimate by all the actors in this process and, perhaps most notably, by teachers. The rest of the paper focuses on our approaches to involve teachers in making decisions about technology use in their own classrooms. The strategy used was based on the realisation of research activities underpinned by the idea of the collaborative design of learning situations and the goal of including the wide diversity of learners that characterises Brazilian mathematics classrooms. © FIZ Karlsruhe 2009.","Collaborative design; Digital technologies; Embodied cognition; Inclusion; Mathematics learning",,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2005/60655-4","Acknowledgments We would like to thank a number of our colleagues from the research group TecMEM for their valuable contributions to the research reported in this paper.

After, we engage in showing mathematics education's historical and epistemological grip to this ideology. We claim that mathematics education appears in the time period that English becomes an international language and the notion of international seems to be a key constructor in the constitution of that ideology.

Significant findings which threw light on the aforementioned relationship have been presented in Agudelo-Valderrama, Clarke and Bishop (2007), highlighting a direct association between a teacher's conceptions of the nature of beginning algebra, the crucial determinants of her/his teaching practice, and her/his attitude to change. After an overview of the study, this paper focuses on specific evidence which clearly shows that in contrast to the strong relationship between a teacher's conceptions of mathematics and her/his teaching practice, assumed in the theoretical model of teachers' thought structures, the teachers see a strong relationship between their conceptions of social/institutional factors of teaching and what they do in their teaching.

This paper reports a study aiming to characterise the distinct modelling routes performed by Costa Rican undergraduate students when solving a mathematical modelling task involving the concept of system of linear equations (SLE). In analysing those modelling routes, it was possible to identify their learning of linear algebra concepts and their modelling competencies as well as the associated difficulties that students faced. Data collection included participant observation, with audio recording of the students’ discussions, their written work on the task, and digital files of their work with technology. The results show that non-linear routes are associated with a greater mobilisation of students’ knowledge on SLE concepts and with their development of modelling competencies.

They create spaces for action, while at the same time they pose restrictions and can generate unexpected situations, both for teachers and students. In this paper, we show examples in which teachers respond to contingencies emerging from the use of interactive programs in the classrooms. By describing different ways in which teachers react to those contingencies, we show how the technology plays an important role, at times by creating unexpected situations, and at others in support of teachers’ explanations. In both cases it can promote modifications in students’ actions and shape teachers’ actions and responses in relation to a particular mathematical situation or problem. Understanding how teachers react when they are faced with an unexpected situation is important in order to gain knowledge about those particular responses that result in effective behaviors that are related to mathematics learning, and also in terms of the construction of rich learning environments that promote those kinds of behaviors. Results show that the kind of interaction that technology has the potential for promoting plays an important role in making students and teachers more aware of students’ doubts and misunderstandings, but that this potential needs to be accompanied by effective teachers’ strategies through which they use contingencies as opportunities to promote both their own and their students’ learning.

However, typically such inspirations impose a devastating narrowness in relation to reflections on mathematics. This narrowness I refer to as the “banality of mathematical expertise”. Reflections on mathematics can be expressed through a philosophy of mathematics that goes beyond the traditional emphasis on ontological and epistemological dimensions, to become four-dimensional by also addressing social and ethical issues. Many working philosophies of mathematics operate within a narrow scope of reflections, seemingly located within an ethical vacuum. The consequence is a cultivation of a banality, manifest in many university studies in mathematics as well as in dominant research paradigms in mathematics. This constitutes a serious limitation in providing models for mathematics education. By contrast, there exist examples of practices of mathematics education that demonstrate a richness of reflections on mathematics. Accordingly, I address the extent to which such practices of critical mathematics education could serve as models for research mathematics and mathematics education at the university level. © 2020, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Banality of mathematical expertise; Critical mathematics education; Ethics; Philosophy of mathematics; Role model",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086365616

Prospective teachers wrote narratives about their own teaching during their traineeship period at schools, and shared them with their colleagues and with the university tutor in an online forum. A narrative is a description of a teaching–learning situation that incorporates reasons about what has happened during the teaching, and justifications of plausible future teaching actions. We analyzed changes in the prospective teachers’ narratives by scrutinizing how prospective teachers identify Mathematically Significant Pedagogical Opportunities to Build on Student Thinking (MOSTs) and in which ways they take advantage of them. Additionally, we analyzed whether these changes could be related to the feedback provided in the online forum. The findings indicate changes in how prospective teachers notice their practice, evidenced by the manner in which the MOSTs are taken advantage of, and by the reasons given for their actions. These findings suggest that sharing narratives in online forums and receiving feedback from their colleagues and from the university tutor help prospective teachers to enhance the skill of noticing, leading to changes in their practice.

In this sense, we are drawing up on embodied cognition articulated with the conceptions of perception and body-proper arising from the phenomenological view discussed by Merleau-Ponty.

Thematic analysis was used to analyze data gathered through semi-structured interviews. Results revealed that teachers’ beliefs are organized in different clusters that connect their beliefs about mathematics and assessment in mathematics. Some specific mathematical beliefs and beliefs on assessment played a central role on the construction of these clusters (e.g. ‘mathematics is for applications’). There are two complementary reasons for the existence of these beliefs: the daily context of the participants and their condition of being out-the-field teachers with vocational training as engineers. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Assessment in mathematics; Mathematical beliefs; Teacher beliefs; Teachers’ beliefs about assessment in mathematics; Thematic analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064481120

Student needs were measured through a needs assessment methodology scheme that included a content analysis of peer-reviewed journals, a nationwide cross-sectional survey, and semi-structured interviews. The research question that guided the study was: what are the mathematical needs of biological sciences undergraduate students as perceived by certain stakeholder groups? The stakeholder groups represented the areas of ecology, evolution, and behaviour, and developmental biology to portray two extremes in the use of mathematics. Major findings included: (1) The use of mathematics to support experimental design is the most consistent need across disciplines. (2) An overall understanding of mathematical models is needed as a minimum for scientific literacy. (3) Evolution and animal behaviour students need descriptive and inferential statistics, stochastic processes, differential equations, and mathematical models in general. Developmental biology students, on the other hand, need only descriptive and inferential statistics, and mathematical models. These needs, however, strongly vary depending on students’ career tracks within their subdisciplines, suggesting the necessity of a flexible undergraduate curriculum. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biology education; mathematics education; needs assessment; student needs; undergraduate education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055703897

Using the philosophical theory of inferentialism, we trace an epistemological dimension of multilingualism in mathematics education and add it to the current language-as-resource discussions. With data from two different settings—a mathematics classroom in Sweden and a workshop in an indigenous settlement in Colombia—we show that in encounters between language practices and plural mathematics, the semantic and the epistemological are two sides of the same coin. Inferentialism captures such encounters without dichotomising either languages or mathematics. We contend that epistemological issues move beyond the scope of language-as-resource approaches, but they are not paths to improving school achievement. Neither are they matters of distinguishing between formal and informal language use. Rather, an epistemological dimension is about shaping meta-understandings of language diversity that are liberated from mathematics as fixed and pre-stablished knowledge. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Professional development programs are proposed as effective mechanisms to fabricate the “new” teacher. However, this teacher has proved hard to produce. Thus, the “resistor” teacher has emerged into the field as a way to explain failure within school mathematics reform. In this article, I assume that resistance is a consequential response against particular forms of subjectivation imposed on mathematics teachers. Using conceptual tools from Hall and Foucault, I explore the ways wherein a high school mathematics teacher reinvents meanings of being a mathematics teacher in the context of a professional development program aimed to implement problem-solving instruction. Against the myth of the resistor teacher unwilling to change, what emerges is a process of struggle over meaning. School mathematics reform, considered as an ideological event, becomes a site in which competing meanings about being a mathematics teacher are negotiated, contested, and resisted. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Mathematics teacher; Meaning; Professional development programs; Resistance; Subjectivities",,"3180238; FB0003","Funding information Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and CONICYT/FONDECYT #3180238 is gratefully recognized.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058467603

In order to do so, it was provided an education course based on the conception of Cybereducation with mathematics teachers (ROSA, 2015), which considers Digital Technologies (DT) in the context of Mathematics Education as participants in the knowledge production movement. In addition, regarding Mobile Cybereducation, this knowledge production movement is purposely raised in an informal manner through the smartphone, in line with social networks. In this sense, smartphones were made available for mobile access to these online platforms, while the participants were dispersed geographically. Under this bias, we understand the ""being/participant"" connected to a mobile device and this links us to the corporeity of these participants in the Merleau-Ponty (2011) perspective, pointing out as a result that teachers establish mathematical connections between peers hyper-textually plugged in a ubiquitously way. This perspective suggests the act of education with DT that happens all the time and everywhere, so that the technological resource becomes part of us, expanding/potentializing the mathematical connections made in a shared way. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

They appear in a variety of forms and adopt various approaches to present the content. In this paper, we turn our attention to one chapter of a calculus textbook and our focus is on the introduction of the derivative concept. With the purpose of examining the presentation of the derivative concept in the textbook, we give a view of Peirce’s semiotics, in particular of his classification of sign-vehicles. The analysis allows us to point out that the sign-vehicle in relation to the derivative concept may be iconic, indexical, or symbolic. These do not constitute mutually exclusive kinds of signs, but they are interrelated in such a way that we can identify iconicity in indexicality and indexicality in symbolicity. We conclude that the textbook has the potential to enable students to conceptualize the derivative. However, in some aspects, the book may constrain students’ conceptualization and it could be improved to meet the students’ needs to make meaning of the derivative concept. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053190566

It operates with the concepts of visuality, image, experience, device, and cartography, to suggest that the images of art could be a place to exercise mathematical thinking. To this end, two investigative essays are presented to demonstrate a methodological way of dealing with paintings that goes further than simply teaching and learning mathematics.

In order to do so, a methodology of vignettes was used, in which educators were asked to talk about their work on problem solving with students.

This conviction obstructs the use of this knowledge in the classroom. Starting from these conjectures, we planned a training course, on ethnomathematics, for primary school teachers in Colombia. The course was taken as an investigative case through a qualitative methodology for case studies. The records produced from a group interview and researcher's field diary were analyzed under the Wittgenstein's philosophy view. We concluded that the conjectures are not met, since there is no complete consistency between the epistemological concepts and action in the classroom.

In this paper, through some examples, the use of such functions is described for dealing different problems in university students learning. From the background and the stated examples, it can be seen that these tools have potential for the diagnosis and treatment of many kinds of errors associated with mathematical practices. Semiotic functions allow: visualization of the level of complexity of a particular mathematical practice; accurately assessment of the student mathematical practice for meaning discrepancies, and promotion of the redesign of teaching sequences, bearing in mind the complexities and conflicts detected. It is also outlined the steps of successive refinements for defining appropriate semiotic functions for the analysis of a particular problem. Thus, a systematization of this process is shown, which enables its application in other researches related to the study of meanings.","Meaning; Methodological tool; Ontosemiotic Approach; Semiotic functions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970965452

Here, I present a third theory in terms of an intentionality interpretation of meaning, which provides an alternative departure for the discussion of meaning in mathematics education. The importance of intentionality for understanding human phenomena was emphasised by both Brentano and Husserl. They associated intentionality with a pure stream of consciousness, which constitutes an a priori to any human experience. I agree that the notion of intentionality is important; however, I find it crucial to provide a paradigmatic uprooting of this notion and to consider it as being structured by economic, political, cultural, and discursive factors. Such real-life intentionalities constitute the basis for an intentionality interpretation of meaning. I explore this interpretation with respect to mathematics education by addressing imaginations, possibilities, obstructions, hopes, fears, stereotypes and preconceptions. I relate meaning in mathematics education to far away horizons of students’ life worlds, to negotiations, to political issues, to diversity and to instrumentalism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Intentionalities; Intentionality interpretation of meaning; Meaning in mathematics education; Politics of meaning; Real-life intentionalities",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944544229

Therefore, we take as reference the studies of Romanatto (1997) and Gomes (2010) and we adopted the following meanings for the rational numbers: measure (part-whole), quotient, reason, multiplicative operator, probability, a number in straight numerical, and percentages. To analyze the records of representations of the rational numbers that are contemplated in ENEM, we used the Theory of the Semiotics Representations by Raymond Duval, who considers that mathematical objects are not directly perceptible and that access to them is possible only through a system of representation. We concluded that, the meanings identified in the items relative to the 1998 to 2008 ENEM were virtually the same identified in the period of the new ENEM. In the items related to math tests and their technologies of the 2009 to 2011 ENEMs, the semiotic register of rational numbers that were most mobilized during its resolutions was the fractional numerical register.","ENEM; Meanings; Rational numbers; Representations",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920600657

Such outcomes suggest that the act of reading algebraic texts submerges the reader into a network of intertextual relations derived from that reader’s prior mathematics and linguistic experiences. In this article we propose an analytical perspective of algebraic activity that is based on intertextuality and that makes it possible to advance our knowledge concerning the production of sense in said activity. In particular, we resort to the notion of intertextuality as a means of theoretically describing and explaining sense production processes in the learning of two algebraic methods: the Cartesian Method (for the algebraic solution of word problems) and the Substitution Method (for the solution of systems of two linear equations with two unknowns). We support our arguments via a series of episodes of empirical study interviews with secondary school students, in order to demonstrate the pertinence and relevance of carrying out their analysis from the perspective proposed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Algebraic methods; Cartesian Method; Intertextuality in algebra teaching and learning; Sense production; Substitution Method; Texts and intertexts in algebra learning",,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 168620","Acknowledgments We want to thank Centro Escolar Revueltas in Mexico City for providing us with the facilities to carry out the empirical work of the long-term research project “Operating the unknown”.

Therefore, our interest was to investigate how students learn mathematics, how they construct knowledge, and which is the level of their constructed learning of a mathematical content that is especially difficult for them, i.e. the concept of derivative and its applications. This work is part of a broader research that considered a multiple case study. Here we present the results obtained from two of them To investigate constructed learning we used Dubinsky's APOS cognitive model. We created an interactive teaching environment, supported by classroom lessons and class modules of practical work based on Computer Workshops. Some results will be mentioned briefly. It was found that if the concept of ""Derivative at a point"" is not understood at the level of action, the students have difficulty in extending it and moving to a higher level of understanding and interpreting the concept geometrically. They also have difficulties understanding when they have to discriminate between true and false propositions set out on properties of the derivative related to monotony and concavity of a function. Conclusions were drawn on learning achieved and on the teaching strategies being implemented.","APOS cognitive model; Case studies; Derivative; Genetic decomposition",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901945191

It has been noticed that many textbooks recommend the use of calculators in the classroom and suggest specific activities. In the PNLD teacher's guide, only in the analysis of some textbooks is there clear information on calculator usage in the classroom. Calculator usage is mainly encouraged in the textbooks of the final years in primary school, mostly with multiplication and division, and distributed in four types of activities: conceptual development, verification of results, results calculation and calculator tool manipulation. Many textbooks have considered the recommendation to use modern technological devices to aid the learning of mathematics, while others still have to assess the value of the calculator as a valid instrument in developing mathematical knowledge. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884138700

This reality is particularly viewed as a possible vector of virtualization, i.e. as an element that enables the transformation of the perception of the problem involving a particular situation or entity. To do so, we make an association between mathematical modeling and transformations that involve the ways of being denoted by real, possible, current and virtual, through the four Aristotelian causes. Complementing this association, we assume a conception of problem that allows a consolidation among the established relationships and also a conception of reality that sees the cyberworld as one of its dimensions.

The methodological approach was qualitative and the main procedure was the analysis of the work report developed by the group. From the analysis, it was possible to notice at least two different ways in which the group interpreted what to be critical means: one that suggests a critical insertion of students in their reality, and another that relied on mathematical certainties to reach the conclusions of the project.","Critical mathematics education; Liberating education; Mathematical modelling; Mathematics education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881325594

Two basic operations performed in GF(pn) are the addition and the multiplication. While the addition is generally easy to compute, the multiplication requires a special treatment. A well-known method to compute the multiplication is based on logarithm and antilogarithm tables. A primitive element of a GF(pn) is a key part in the construction of such tables, but it is generally hard to find a primitive element for arbitrary values of p and n. This article presents a naive algorithm that can simultaneously find a primitive element of GF(pn) and construct its corresponding logarithm and antilogarithm tables. The proposed algorithm was tested in GF(pn) for several values of p and n; the results show a good performance, having an average time of 0.46 seconds to find the first primitive element of a given GF(pn) for values of n={2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12} and prime values p between 2 and 97.","Algorithm; Galois Field; Logarithm tables; Multiplication",,,"The authors thankfully acknowledge the computer resources and assistance provided by Spanish Supercomputing Network (TIRANT).

Then, we exhibit a parallel relationship between the general case of this problem and a family of means called POEM's (for pth Order Extreme Means). This shows that the POEM's not only share with the golden mean the algebraic and geometric properties established by Falbo, but also a remarkable minimizing physical property.

Statistical concepts, as well as the use of statistical methods and techniques, can be taught in at least two contrasting ways. Specifically, (1) teaching can be theoretically and mathematically oriented, or (2) it can be less mathematically oriented being focused, instead, on application and the use of data to solve real-world problems. The second approach is growing in practice and new goals have recently emerged. At present, statistics courses stress probability concepts, data analysis, and the interpretation and communication of results. Understanding the process of statistical investigation is established as a way of improving mastery of statistical reasoning. In this context, a project-based approach allows the design and implementation of participating learning scenarios in order to understand the statistical methodology and, as a consequence, improve research. This approach points out that statistics is a rational methodology used to solve practical problems. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and results of an applied statistics course for PhD students in ecology and systematics using a project-based approach. Examples involving character coding, species classification, and the interpretation of geographical variation, which are the principal systematic analyses requiring statistical techniques, are presented using the results from student projects. In addition, an example from conservation ecology is presented. Results indicate that the students understood the concepts and applied the systematic and statistical techniques accurately using a data oriented approach. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856913245

After reviewing quaternion algebra via an isomorphic 4 × 4 matrix representation, a different definition is given to partial derivatives involving quaternions. This takes care of the ambiguity involved in the noncommutative properties of quaternions. A closely analogous condition for analiticity of functions of a quaternion variable is found.

Based on this proposal, this position paper looks at the design of one Mathematics Professional Development Program (MPDP) through the lenses of these concepts. We argue that the reification concept allows professional designers to keep in mind the resources they should use to organize teachers’ learning, while the participation concept allows them to ponder the types of activities that should be implemented in order for the teachers to adequately assimilate the meaning of those resources. The example that serves as the context in which we situate our discussion is the Data Analysis Project, a professional development project on statistics in which 5 in-service secondary school teachers participated. Due to the dialectic relation between participation and reification, we explain how these two processes intertwine to maintain the balance needed to allow teachers’ learning to proceed within an MPDP. We argue that this dialectic relation is the key element for MPDP designers to connect the resources produced by research in mathematics education to the practice of mathematics teaching. Such a connection allows an MPDP to act as a bridge between two communities of practice: that of researchers in the field of mathematics education and that of mathematics teachers. Ultimately, the article shows how Wegner’s concepts of participation and reification may be used to design an MPDP. © 2021, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).","Communities of practice; Mathematics teachers’ learning; Participation and reification; Professional development",,,"The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the different versions of this manuscript.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117098387

The PD workshop was held in Chile and promoted the use of collaborative problem-solving activities in the classroom, through monthly sessions during the school year. Participant teachers met with a monitor to solve a new problem collaboratively, plan a problem-solving activity for their next lesson, and reflect on their activities from their previous lesson. The study documents the performance of two groups of students when solving non-routine mathematics problems in two similar and non-equal tests consisting of three problems each, before and after the year of application of the workshop. The first group of students was the experimental group with collaborative problem-solving activities, as proposed in the PD workshop. The second group was the control group, composed of students whose teachers followed traditional teaching. In the first part of the paper we present the results of pre- and post-tests in which the students in the experimental group improved their problem-solving performance in a significant way compared with the control group. In the second part, we present a sample of representation strategy used by successful students in both groups and we discuss, in general, student strategies in solving test problems. © 2021, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Collaborative problem solving; Impact of a program; Problem-solving strategies; Professional development program; Students’ performance",,"FB0003, PAI AFB-170001; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 3170673","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions, which improved the paper considerably.

The qualitative analysis indicates that the majority of future teachers consider that the didactics of mathematics is a technical discipline that consists of providing strategies, resources, and procedures for teaching mathematics; few consider it as an art to teaching and almost none consider it as a scientific discipline that is concerned with studying the processes of teaching and learning mathematics. In addition, the results show that the criteria used by them, on how teaching and learning in this discipline can be improved, are focus, above all, in the cognitive, ecological, and emotional aspects and, to a lesser extent, to the interactional, mediational and epistemic.

Along with its development, mathematics has been taught through formal education or schooling in the flat- not flexible ways and far from students' social and cultural lives. Indonesia is rich with culture, including the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY). It is called a city of culture. Educators are not yet aware of this richness in the learning process to integrate it as the starting point. It is hard to find in mathematics textbooks in Indonesia, which put cultural context as starting points. Therefore, this study aims to explore Yogyakarta's culture in terms of contexts used in mathematics learning. It is an ethnography study. Furthermore, the data was collected through literature artifacts, field observation, and interviews with resource persons who understand the seasons, system, and calculation of birth and death days. It is to clarify the researcher's understanding of the literature. This study showed that Yogyakarta's people use mathematical modeling to determine the seasons' system and funerary dates.

This diversity often forges appropriation processes of numeracy practices that defy the rationality assumed by hegemonic mathematics and confront us with the insufficiency of not only the syntactic approach, but also the semantic resources in school mathematics teaching. Focusing on events occurring in classrooms of different programs that I have been accompanying in Brazil, I identify and analyze tensions, disputes, and complementarities among the signification efforts being referenced in syntactic, semantic or pragmatic dimensions of language games that constitute the discursive interactions in these contexts. My analysis is based on theoretical tools of language studies that invest in reflections on pragmatics and, as in Wittgenstein’s later works, assume that meaning is determined by use, allowing scholars to approach linguistic signification as a social phenomenon and numeracy practices as discursive practices of social subjects in interaction. The findings provide evidence to further discuss the complexity of the classroom, to which the vulnerability of the students’ living conditions adds decisive elements, challenges and possibilities. © 2019, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Appropriation of School Numeracy Practices; Diversity of forms of life in the classroom; Meaning and signification; Pragmatics of language; Youth and Adult Basic Education",,"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG","This research was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient?fico e Tecnol?gico (CNPq?Brazil) and Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG?Brazil).",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076035648

On these worksheets is requested to estimate the quotient before performing arithmetic operations, in order to start understanding the problem. In various procedures generated by the participants, we find the strategy of placing subtractions in the decimal partial dividends.

That reduces its understood to the memorization of algebraic expressions and algorithmic calculations, which don’t leads to the concept of physical phenomena that present variations and changes, as well as thinking that the derivative is only an indeterminate limit. Within the Mathematics Education research, the concept of derivative has been studied for its importance in mathematics and the difficulty observed in its teaching and learning. These inquiry already provide enough information to teachers to use and design activities around the concept based on research results.

The specific objective is to survey epistemological conceptions of foreign teachers to know whether they are in line with those found in Brazil - which are predominantly empiricist, sometimes supported by aprioristic conceptions, and rarely constructivist. The final objective is to provide background to transform Mathematics teaching. Seventeen teachers from three South American countries were interviewed, using a 24-question script. This text presents their answers to the first three questions. Basically, the same epistemological conceptions found in Brazil were identified, considering the nature, transmission, and genesis of mathematical knowledge. They are similar in terms of the lack of concern with the genesis of mathematical knowledge, the belief in the transmission of this science's concepts, the nature of this knowledge and the presence of empiricist and aprioristic epistemological conceptions. Nevertheless, they differ regarding the somewhat intense presence of epistemological conceptions that are critical (although sometimes unconsciously) towards their repercussions in teaching, in the learning conceptions of the pertinent contents, and in the insistent concern with the practical application of that knowledge. The theoretical framework that guides the analysis is Jean Piaget's Genetic Epistemology, especially his work on reflective abstraction, focused on pseudo-empirical abstraction. The myths criticized that Mathematics is present in everything; that human beings are born mathematicians and that, as such, they are products of the social pressure school education exerts. Similarly, the low valuation of the subject's action in the construction of that knowledge is criticized. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The onto-semiotic complexity of tasks allows the identification of study processes to improve performance in successive algebrization levels, from purely arithmetic manipulation to a practice with a consolidated algebraic level. The objective is twofold: on the one hand, to elaborate indicators that allow evaluating the performance of an operative and discursive practice in the task resolution of counting patterns. On the other hand, to propose a sequence that takes into account the epistemological, cognitive, and teaching restrictions common to these practices. A pre-test and post-test design is proposed using an open-ended questionnaire. A qualitative analysis is carried out through a case study, which provides relevant information on the development of the subjects' algebraic reasoning in the successive algebrization levels.

The answers were classified according to a continuum ranging from incompetence to mastery: the ability, operations involved, consistence and conclusions. The results show that the students answers were largely grouped in a superficial learning approach, this means that, although they deliver relevant data, it does so in an isolated way, they organize the data but there is a failure in the connection between them. It was observed that there is no significant differences between the answers structure and organization from third grade or sixth grade students. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

With the help of twenty Math Honduran teachers, with vast experience in these grades and, applying the Webb alignment model criterion we classified, according to the level of cognitive demand, thirty standards of the algebra block and 110 questions or items of the national evaluation tests. This classification worked as a reference to sort 1912 algebra tasks or activities proposed by official textbooks and standards for teaching math in the studied grades. The results show that there is no adequate alignment or coherence at the level of cognitive demand in the algebra block between these two pieces of the curriculum: Education Standards and Textbooks in the third cycle of basic education in Honduras.

The objective of this research is to develop and validate an instrument which measures the affect of making mistakes in mathematics, and the affect towards mathematics due to errors. The instrument items are based on the relation between the error commission and the three affectivity components: emotions, beliefs, and attitudes. It was administrated to 319 freshmen in the Business School at a private university in Guadalajara, Mexico. The instrument showed strong reliability with an alpha Cronbach of 0,9. Factor analysis confirmed its validity with five constructs related to errors, that explain 52,73% of the total variance: 1) negative emotions and affects on making mistakes, 2) favorable conduct towards the use of errors as a learning tool, 3) mistaken conceptions in regards to usefulness of errors, 4) negative beliefs and emotions towards mathematics due to making mistakes, and 5) the belief that one can learn mathematics from errors. To be able to measure the affectivity students have developed towards errors in mathematics and towards mathematics due to making mistakes as well as their conceptions about errors, may offer a clearer view about of the error culture they have experienced during their school time. Due to this experience, beliefs and attitudes were formed and their behavior may tend to be favorable or not favorable towards their mathematics learning. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The analysis was oriented around four questions: What characteristics should a school curriculum based on an ethnomathematics perspective have? What should the didactic-mathematic knowledge of the professor be in order to attend to such a curriculum? What characteristics do the initial and continuing training courses from an ethnomathematics perspective have? and What theoretical and methodological and theoretical frameworks were used in the investigations? We concluded that the professor must have a creative and reflexive profile, be a researcher, and someone capable of developing a curriculum open to other rationalities; the formation courses teach about the nature of mathematics and the design of activities connected to culture and the methodologies are an important contribution to qualitative-interpretive research.

However, the interaction between the levels has not been elaborated.

Thus, affective individual and interindividual levels seem to interact with culture. In this study we focus on the significance of and the interaction between the individual and the interindividual levels of affect. This is done with respect to 2 different types of countries (Finland and Chile) to include cultural effect. We use questionnaire-based data and pupils’ drawings of their mathematics class to find out about their individual and interindividual experiences. By using mixed data, we are not only getting a wider picture of pupils’ affect but we can also avoid the most typical errors made in the cross-cultural comparisons as the pupils’ own voice is strengthened.

For the data collection were used the recordings of the computer screens, audio recordings of the discussion between students, student records in the responses of the activities and field notes of the researchers. The data were analyzed considering relations between the embodiment of the concept of convergence and proceptualization processes and axiomatization and also considering the transition from elementary mathematical thinking to advanced. The results indicate that the activities enabled the formation of the mental image that the convergence of sequences occurs when the sequence terms are approaching a certain value, and thus propitiated the embodiment of the concept of convergence and established cognitive roots for formal definition of convergence by the limit and further theoretical development.

We address this question through an interpretative analysis of a whole-group conversation in a sixth grade class taught by an experienced teacher in a school in Southern Argentina. The extended interaction (circa 160 speaker turns) concerned a problem involving remainders that calls for building a direct formula and expressing it in symbolic algebraic language. Our functional-grammatical analysis of the selected conversation revealed that, in synch with the deployment and use of the function table, the manner in which the teacher worded her questions was instrumental to the simultaneous accomplishment of three goals. First, her use of the personal pronouns “I” and “we” with generalized referents helped shape a collective zone of proximal development for the class to think aloud together about the algebraizing task at hand. Second, her verb choices supported students in moving among material, mental, operative, and relational processes on the road toward the targeted formula. Finally, by means of repetition, conjunction, demonstrative pronouns, and pointing gestures, the teacher molded the conversation as a coherent and cohesive multi-semiotic text. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947235940

Since the days of Plato, there have been essentially two different answers to this question. To Plato mathematics was a science of the unity and order of this universe. Since Galilei people came to believe that mathematics does not describe the objective world, it is not a reflection of some metaphysical realism. It is rather a reflection of human activity in this world. Kant, by his ""Copernican Revolution of Epistemology"" seems to have been the first to realize this. For example, number, or more generally arithmetic, was to the Pythagoreans ""a cosmology"" (KLEIN, 1985, p. 45), to Dedekind it is a means to better distinguish between things.

Its construction followed an astronomical nature standard that relates primarily to the seasonal solstices, that were related to the stroke of two axes allowing the transit of the Sun on different receptacles, activity developed widely by Mesoamerican cultures. It was possible to corroborate, using an elementary geometric model supported by the Fibonacci golden rule, that the mound was designed, drawn, and built with the same proportion as the Mesoamerican temples and calendars were. The social practice that yielded significant results seen in the related sciences, especially in numerical and astronomical systems, was developed by the ancient Maya for that same purpose.","Mesoamerica; Mound of the Cross; Receptacles; Solstice; Waist Mirror",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941358804

Study 2 applied a math anxiety scale to four children in 6th grade, randomly selected from study 1. It was observed that situations in which students showed high or extreme anxiety were those in which they were exposed to conditions such as exams, schoolwork, and going to the blackboard.

For the research, a questionnaire was applied to 112 teachers of the early years of public schools in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. We asked that they indicate the school year in which that expectation should be addressed. The results show that expectations are most suitable for the content present in textbooks in this stage of schooling. It also revealed that teachers feel freer to express an opinion on expectations that involve simpler skills. The more complex skills are the ones that receive fewer indications on the part of the teachers. We concluded that these skills are possibly little understood by teachers of the early years.","Learning expectations; Math curriculum in the initial years; Relation to knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907915487

They described how the project, which involved teams from three different countries (France, Italy and Greece), working in different conditions and relying on different theoretical approaches, was structured in order to address the role played by contextual characteristics. We consider how the ReMath approach of using cross-studies, and especially the inclusion of a cross-analysis phase, served to identify particularities associated with designing and implementing mathematics learning scenarios using digital tools. In their discussion of the process of re-contextualising, one of the factors which appears to have been particularly influential in shaping research activities was theoretical framework and they show how this factor both influences and is influenced by institutional and cultural characteristics. To further explore some of the other important contextual factors they pinpoint, such as the role and engagement of teachers, student characteristics and issues related to the empirical settings, we reflect upon the processes of re-contextualisation that we could identify in our own research. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Context; Cross-experimentation and analysis; Digital technologies; Networking theories",,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 23038.019444/2009-33; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","3This project was funded by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (project no. 23038.019444/2009-33).

In the construction of several graphics problems were observed. Most of the plotting did not provide the information necessary to understand it. Difficulty with the scale was one of the most evident among the students. We observed that the performance of students who have achieved success with the activities of interpretation failed to ensure proper construction of a chart. This suggests that there is little relationship between such activities and that graphs interpretation was easier than construction.

With this aim, it is considered a real bounded function, defined on a closed and bounded interval, that is analyzed according to conditions which ensure or exclude its integration by Cauchy, by Riemann, by Lebesgue or by none of these integrals.

We point out theoretical elements linked to the properties of mirror symmetry and translational symmetry in the range of activities explored. A degree of intuitive and pragmatic engagement was observed, but not necessarily an increase in the complexity of artistic engagement from one grade to another, as was originally suggested in the Teaching Guide.

We employed a qualitative research approach (characterized as a case study) aimed at analyzing the didactic pedagogical potential of this type of methodology in high school. We found that tasks such as those presented and discussed in this paper provide a more significant learning for the students, allowing a better conceptual understanding, becoming still more powerful when one considers the social-cultural context of the students.","Functions; High School; Mathematics Investigation; Meaningful Learning; Pedagogical Proposal; Problem Solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863852334

This can influence their attitude towards schooling and learning, including the learning of mathematics. We interviewed a group of six students from a favela in a large city in the interior of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. We invited the students to look into their future and explore whether or not there could be learning motives that linked mathematics in school to possible out-of-school practices, either in terms of possible future jobs or further studies. We identified some themes in the students' descriptions of their experiences. The first theme is discrimination. The students feel discriminated against due to the fact that they come from a poor neighbourhood. They fear being trapped in some stereotypes. The second theme is escape. There is a strong motivation to begin a new life away from the favela. A third theme concerns the obscurity of mathematics. It seems clear to everybody that education is relevant to ensure a change in life. However, the mathematics lessons do not provide any clues regarding how mathematics might function is this respect. The fourth theme is uncertainty with respect to the future. The students could easily formulate almost unattainable aspirations, while reality might impose some very heavy limitations. In this article we introduce a theoretical framework for discussing the relation between favela students' life conditions in relation to their educational experiences and opportunities. Students' intentions for learning are related to their foregrounds, that is, how they perceive their future possibilities, as made evident to them by their social environment. Students in a favela could experience what we call a borderland position, a relational space where individuals meet their social environment and come to terms with the multiple choices that cultural and economic diversity make available to them.","Borderland Position; Discrimination; Intentionality; Obscurity of Mathematics; Students' Foreground; Uncertainty with Respect to the Future",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863828905

Two authors keep their proposals for geometry teaching - António Palma Fernandes and Osvaldo Sangiorgi - and two other textbooks - one from António de Almeida Costa e Alfredo Osório dos Anjos and another produced by a group of teachers in Bahiaintegrate the new ideas deeply changing the geometry course. We conclude that curriculum development through textbooks does not linearly follow international recommendations, even when these are not uniform, as is the case of geometry during the Modern Mathematics Movement.

The discussion develops Bill Barton's suggestion that a philosophical basis for the ethnomathematical program should include and explain culturally different mathematics systems, and the coexistence of different conceptions of mathematics and rationality. Wittgenstein's concept of mathematics as normative statements rather than descriptions is introduced to dialogue with ethnomathematics research and its anthropological descriptions of how mathematics is used and propagated in specific practices. It is argued that although the formulations in Wittgenstein's analytical framework alone are insufficient to account for the political character of ethnomathematics, they do provide a starting point for ethnomathematics as a non-metaphysical version of mathematics. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ethnomathematics; Philosophy; Wittgenstein",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149498424

We focus on the relationship between art and education, emphasizing the use of this relationship in mathematics education. We try to understand that mathematical knowledge is not typical in works of art, but is a possible element for organizing the pictorial space and the thoughts of the artist. Thus, two works are analyzed in order to demonstrate how art and mathematics can be related to mathematics education. Finally, we will conclude that art and mathematics can be linked through the exercise of thought, by taking into consideration the mathematical aspect as a working suggestion in order to help to see the art.","Art and education; Mathematical visualization; Mathematics and art; Mathematics education; Teaching geometry",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053092284

However, without exception, such courses are generally offered assuming a modest mathematical prerequisite—usually a course in college algebra—and do not make use of any calculus-based analytical techniques. The use of calculus in an introductory biostatistics course facilitates a rigorous treatment of various statistical concepts and principles and helps to demonstrate many results which the students would have to take on faith, otherwise. Moreover, it permits a more complete discussion of continuous probability distributions. Though calculusbound statistics courses are now well-entrenched in a variety of undergraduate and graduate level programmes in mathematics, statistics, computer sciences, operations research, and other physical, engineering, and management sciences, the use of calculus in a biostatistics course is not yet in vogue. This is primarily because of the non-calculus background of the majority of students who enter biological, medical, and health-related disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to consider the feasibility of a calculus-based course for graduate students in health sciences. Such a course will use some calculus, but will not require calculus as a prerequisite. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442737919

Five pre-service teachers studying a Bachelor’s in Mathematics, and three in-service teachers who were Ph.D. candidates in Mathematics Education participated in the study. A multiple case study was carried out using mixed methods. Closed questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and lesson plans were used as instruments for information collection. The obtained data show how participants have been structuring their beliefs. Moreover, it was possible to determine that in-service teachers have more firm beliefs which were evidenced in their classroom proposals, whereas pre-service teachers have more tentative beliefs that, in general, do not align with what is evidenced through their lesson planners. The training received at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels has permeated the formation of participants’ beliefs which can be evidenced in the obtained results.

The reference meaning of the natural number is reconstructed, based on formal and informal use contexts, reported from the research. On the other hand, with the epistemic configuration tool, the intended meaning of the natural number in the mentioned textbooks is analyzed. The assessment of epistemic suitability is achieved by contrasting the meaning of reference with the intended meaning in textbooks. Some of the results show, for example, that in problem situations the meanings of: numerical, cardinal, operational, and symbolic sequence are promoted. The language addresses the verbal and symbolic representations of natural numbers up to four digits, the use of number tables, number lines and the use of different manipulative materials.

For this reason, it is necessary to pose the problem of sketching the orientations of mathematics curriculum for the new situation. In this position paper, I developed an outline based on a description of the problem situation, the demands that the world of work had already been making on the curriculum at the international level, and the research carried out by mathematics education. From these factors, I assert the significant role of critical mathematics education, particularly the motto of reading and writing the world with mathematics. I propose that orientations for the mathematics curriculum in basic education in the new normality should include ethical and political issues, statistical and financial literacy, digital skills as a part of a STEM approach, ethnomathematics from native people, and, finally, a problem-posing and problem-solving approach.

Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven’s (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177–211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator’s process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices.

Their responses were analyzed by complementing the Covariation Framework and the Change in Covarying Quantities Framework. The analysis revealed that the PSTs’ covariational reasoning increased in sophistication as they completed the task, advancing from describing direction of change to reasoning about the rate of change. Each level of sophistication either supported or constrained the PSTs’ ability to specify nonlinear growth, anticipate concavity, draw accurate graphs, and make viable claims about the rate of change.

Then, by using the degree of completeness indicators of a local mathematical organisation, we analyse the mathematical activity carried out by the students. Our analysis suggests that: a) with this study process it is possible to address in a functional way part of the geometric knowledge proposed in the Secondary curriculum, and b) the rigidity of the school mathematical activity, usual in Secondary classes, on the one hand, limits the possibility of using different techniques to solve the same task and to construct new techniques; and, on the other hand, does not help to question the validity domain of the techniques used in class. © 2021 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

Thus, assuming the phenomenological attitude of research, we ask: what is seen on the adoption of Mathematical Modeling in the literature produced within the scope of Mathematics Education? This interrogation led us to consider 109 researches directed to Modeling, made available in the Catalog of Theses Dissertations of the Commission for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, in Google Academic and in the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. Their analysis revealed that recurrent mentions to the adoption of Modeling are restricted to the favorable aspects, challenges, and procedures necessary to work with it at school, with no initiatives seeking to understand the adoption by focusing on who is the subject able to adopt it, the teacher. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Specifically, adults' previous experience with area calculation was considered. Principles of the Theory of Didactical Situations (TDS) formulated by Brousseau guided the study design, and Pick's theorem was recreated in a dynamic digital setting, with which it is possible to calculate the area of regular and irregular polygons. In this approach, intuitive notions of area and perimeter are resorted to, seeking to promote the experience with powerful ideas such as 'the generality of a method', 'realizing the existence of different methods used for one and the same end' and 'realizing that each method possesses advantages and limitations'. Analysis of interview protocols from three noteworthy cases (which include both adults' work in the digital setting and their discussions with the researcher) suggests the presence of powerful underlying mathematical ideas, such as the idea of generality and the power of a method and the features of the constituent elements of a geometric figure that are involved in calculating its attributes, attributes such as area. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

This article analyzes whether these principles of effectiveness are present in a teacher professional development program and examines its impact on the teacher’s teaching practice, using a qualitative methodology to operationalize such principles. The purpose of this study is to identify the principles of effective professional development programs for Mathematics teachers in the guidelines of a Chilean mathematics didactic graduate program. Additionally, the plausible effectiveness of the graduate program was examined through a case study of a teacher who participated in it. Evidence was found for the presence of all principles in the graduate program. Furthermore, from the cognitive demand perspective of the classroom mathematics tasks, before, during, and after the graduate program, the teacher examined in the study evolved significantly in relation to her teaching.

The results showed that the quality of the intra-mathematical connections: different representations, procedural, implication, part-whole and meaning of the students, is found mostly at level 2 (consistent and argued mathematical connections) and only one student presented inconsistencies to find the correctness equation of the tangent line to the curve at a point (quality level 0 connection).

In this research, a systematic use of DSCs is proposed by applying an ordinal scale (Likert type) with four positions to quantify each of the criteria and thus evaluate the didactic sequences. The researchers (one of whom is the teacher trainer) discussed the didactic sequences developed by the teachers, based on the classroom recordings, where the analysis allowed them to draw conclusions about the didactic decisions made by the teachers. The use of DSCs reveals strengths and weaknesses in the teachers' teaching sequences. The analysis of the didactic sequences' suitability presented by the teachers suggests that the qualified course has served to improve their competence in didactic analysis, although evidence has also been found suggesting that previous teaching experience also provides important elements that explain a greater suitability in some criteria considered in the analysis. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

For that, it uses the Theory of Semiotic Representation Records and the Anthropological Theory of Didactics, the latter limited to its perspective of ostensive and non-ostensive objects.

Our purpose in this paper is to discuss how the creation of videos with mathematical content may contribute to this process of rendering the classroom borderless, as well as how this activity can become a teaching and learning tool. We ground our discussion in social semiotics, a theory that considers the context of production and the negotiations between actors to analyze the meanings produced. We report on the production of videos by middle school students and the steps involved: discussion, editing and dissemination. At each step, data were produced and collected. We focus our analysis on the question of how the production of videos in the classroom can help in the communication of mathematical knowledge and in the change of the dynamics of the classroom. We find that video production provides a classroom dynamic in which students can become protagonists in the teaching and learning process, with teachers mediating this activity. We argue that video production is a different way to express mathematics, and it is particularly well-suited to expressing what students have understood. Using videos, a new kind of mathematics can emerge in the classroom, joining its traditional symbolic language with other modes, such as language, gesture, image and music. © 2020, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Classroom changes; Humans-with-media; Internet; Sign of learning; Social semiotics; Video production",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 142290/2016-5, 303326/2015-8, 400590/2016-6","We would like to thank CNPQ (Grant Nos. 400590/2016-6, 303326/2015-8 and 142290/2016-5) for their partial support of this research.

We apply Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) Theory to pose a preliminary genetic decomposition (GD), conjecturing mental constructions that students would need to relate Riemann sums to integrals of functions of two variables over rectangles. The genetic decomposition is informed by the researchers’ classroom experience, findings of a previous study that applied semiotic representation theory, and by a study on integrals of functions of one variable. We pay particular attention to the case of an integral of a continuous function over a rectangle and the simplest partition possible, that consisting only of the rectangle itself. We then explore students’ geometrical understanding of the relation between the single termfa,bΔxΔy, where a,b is a point on the rectangle, and the double integral over the rectangle. We tested the GD by performing student interviews with 10 students who had just finished taking a lecture-based multivariable calculus course. The findings underscore the importance of each of the mental constructions described in the genetic decomposition and suggests that students have difficulty in some mental constructions that may commonly be assumed to be obvious during instruction. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","APOS; Calculus; Double integrals; Function of two variables; Genetic decomposition; Riemann sums",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086453840

For this, we used the Content Analysis method, where the objects of analysis are found in content exposition, worked examples, and in the exercises or problems proposed in the textbooks. As a reference framework we used the eleven slope conceptualizations identified by Stump (1999) and Moore-Russo, Conner and Rugg (2011). Our findings indicate the presence of most of the conceptualizations identified in the previous research, however, there is a notable predominance of those that emerge from the analytical definition of slope, such as the parametric coefficient, algebraic ratio, and trigonometric conception and its internal application in determination of parallelism or perpendicularity between lines as is the determining property. These conceptualizations, on the one hand, induce to formation of the idea that slope makes sense only in intra-mathematical context, and on the other hand, they favor the development of procedural knowledge on detriment of conceptual knowledge. Understanding the slope requires the creation of internal networks as a product of connections between conceptualizations intra and extra mathematical plane, in addition to the harmonious development of conceptual and procedural knowledge. Achieving the understanding of the concepts is essential for Mathematics Education, however, our results indicate that the texts used by teachers can hardly contribute to this achievement. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The students developed these projects in modeling scenarios created in their mathematics classes. Our research seeks to investigate: 1) the learning of students participating in active mathematical modeling scenarios with experimental activities and digital technologies and, 2) the role that digital technologies play in modeling processes that involve experimental activities. In theoretical terms, the perspective of situated learning and the epistemological vision embedded in the humans-with-media construct are adopted. Learning is evidenced by the participation of students in different phases of mathematical modeling processes developed in local communities of practice in the educational context. The digital technologies most used by the students were their cell phones and cameras, to record experiments and take measurements, and mathematical software to represent graphs and communicate results. These uses were related to the experimentation and resolution phases. The in-depth analysis of a particular project shows the potential and creative use of various digital technologies in these phases. It is important to note that the study provides an example that responds to curricular recommendations around the inclusion of modeling and the use of technologies in mathematics classes.

The research has been mainly driven by curriculum reforms and the creation of research groups that investigate teaching, learning, and teacher education practices. The present paper emerges from this scenario and has the aim of investigating practices of creative insubordination of teachers proposing and acting on problems of statistical and probabilistic literacy under a problematizing perspective. The intention is to ask: ‘What evidence of statistical and probabilistic learning emerges when teacher-researchers participating in collaborative groups narrate their actions of creative insubordination?’ The term ‘creative insubordination’ refers to professionals acting counter to rules and directives when seeking to protect those to whom they provide services and in order to provide better conditions. In the case of Brazilian teachers, it is argued that they can be creatively insubordinate by proposing problems in statistics and probability, listening to the children and encouraging them to problematize and create strategies and procedures for solving statistical problems, in a perspective that encompasses their social practices. From the analysis emerged a common aspect of the teachers’ practices that refers to the fact that they provide an investigative atmosphere in which children discuss, question and reflect, proposing creative solutions to statistical problems.

Stakeholders with different perspectives have considered how to help students develop computational thinking skills. It is important to measure whether a concept, skill or knowledge has been developed or not. The aim of this study is to adapt the computational thinking test developed in Spanish to Turkish. Firstly, computational thinking test was translated into Turkish and evaluated by experts. Secondly, the test was then translated back to Spanish, and the initial version and the back translated version was compared and then the translation process was completed. Lastly, the Turkish version of computational thinking test was administered to middle school students and evaluated for item difficulty, item discrimination and internal consistency. As a result of these analyzes, the test, which had 28 items in Spanish, was reduced to 24 items. The scores obtained from the test were evaluated in terms of gender and grade level. The test scores did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of gender. There was no significant difference in (i) fifth and sixth grade students and (ii) seventh and eighth grade students in terms of students' computational thinking scores. However, a significant difference was found between these two groups (5-6 and 7-8).

The analysis was carried out from a double theoretical perspective: the didactic situations are characterized and analyzed from the Theory of Didactic Situations (Brousseau, 1998), while, for the analysis of teaching practices, the double didactic/ergonomic approach was mainly considered (Robert y Rogalski, 2002) and the ethnographic perspective (Rockwell & Mercado, 2003). Although the transformations identified are different from each other, in both cases, the essentials of the didactic purposes were preserved. This is expressive of the need and feasibility of appropriation processes. The main contribution of the text is the identification of factors that underlie these transformations, of the needs to which they respond and of the tensions they create in decision-making in the classroom. © 2020, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

The achievement of this project, required the search and analysis of documentary sources at the archives of the Mathematics Institute (IM), the Physics Institute (IF) and the University of Education (FACED), among others, as well as semi-structured interviews with the pioneer teachers. Analyzing the Institute's foundation from a gender perspective, made it possible to visualize a surprising history involving women and mathematics, a field traditionally associated with masculinity. This revealed a history permeated by gender relations, power relations, social relations involving gender, class, race, in which the participants were building the space mentioned without realizing that they were inside a social plot that even nowadays maintains the masculine supremacy in the academic world, as well as in other sectors of the society. The study revealed that these women built and consolidated the IMF, as subjects of knowledge. They were the social agents who made Mathematics happen in the context of the Federal University of Bahia and provided the new generations the existence of an Mathematics Institute with its own life and ready to face the challenges of the new century. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Considering these theoretical-philosophical elements, mathematical modelling activities were developed in a Mathematics Degree in a course of Ordinary Differential Equations. Data were collected through written records, audio and video recordings, questionnaires, and interviews. The data analysis methodology considers the students' discursive practices and allowed us to construct trees of idea association. The results indicate that the constitution of meaning within modelling activities is associated to the students' linguistic appropriation of the rules and techniques that are configured in specific language games identified in the Mathematical Modelling activities. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

It is considered that the engagement of senior people in educational environments can contribute to the maintenance and development of cognitive aspects, which are fundamental to their autonomy. In addition, participation in these environments can favor changes in their physical, social, and psychological aspects, enhancing their self-esteem. In this paper, we discuss results of a research which aimed at understanding possible ways to promote such educational actions and to providing elements to a reflection about its contributions to senior people. Data production occurred within the project Conversation about Mathematics with Senior People. Data were collect through interviews, photos, and notes in a research notebook. Data analysis reveals an active engagement of the women and men in the project as well as provides some indication about contributions to the senior people. About their engagement, we considered: a) their interest in discussing the subjects during the meetings; b) their persistence to perform mathematics tasks on their own; c) their argumentation about the ideas showed; and d) their movement of sharing the activities with other people who were not participating in the project. In relation to contribution to senior people, we considered manifestations that expressed: a) improvement of cognitive aspects; b) opportunity for social interaction; and c) the possibility of learning new subjects related to Mathematics. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The corpus consists of 72 French notebooks from the period between 1870 and 1936. Besides the notebooks' exploration, the discussions approached the relations with prescriptions and guidelines for mathematics teaching in French primary school in that historical period. The theoretical framework for the analysis involved Certeau's consumption concept, Gvirtz and Larrondo's perspective of the notebook as both a product and a producer of school culture, and the importance of considering the existence of specific rules for the use of notebooks, as mentioned by Viñao. The results show that, over time the themes used in problems little by little stopped approaching aspects of life in the countryside, and the teaching March, which initially involved only one type of problem (proportionality), started to approach the centrality of a specific content - also related to type-problems - and to propose a sequence of contents in the period between 1915 and 1936.

Both music and sound can synergically act as scaffolding for learning, intervening as part of situated knowledge, and they could offer a new perspective for learning mathematics at schools, giving pupils opportunities to develop their own mental representations. Also, the incorporation of an affective/emotional analysis, as criteria for evaluation, seems pertinent and complementary to other criteria in the production of multimedia material with educational purposes both in formal and non-formal domains of education. These are the intentions of the present work, which shows the design, implementation and assessment of AudioFractions, as part of an educational software package called Sound Interactive Music- Mathematics, which was conceived to aid mathematical learning through sound and music in Chilean Primary Education. The investigation was carried out in a three-stage design: 1) generate significant metaphors; 2) implement and test functional software prototypes and didactic guidelines; and 3) assess the software. Pupils in risk of social exclusion at three priority public schools in Santiago de Chile (N=137; 9-11 years old) were subjected to AudioFractions in one 60-minute session. Then, students filled a questionnaire validated by experts with their perceptions about the software and their emotions.

Although students prepare some answers with a degree of autonomy, their justifications are based on aspects of common statistical content knowledge without actually applying more advanced thinking, required by the problem posed.

At first, we analyzed a diagnostic test of a pre-calculus course in which newly enrolled university students participated. It was found that students have difficulties to establish relationships and differences between different notations of real numbers and to decide on their use in a given situation. Further, the difficulties of using the representations and recognizing the effect of using one representation or another in the resolution of the problem were evident.

It aims to analyze written and oral narratives produced by students from a Pedagogy program of a Brazilian Federal University. We take into account that the mathematical training of these students has started before the access to higher education. Thus, we consider it is important to understand this previous knowledge in order to contribute to these students' training process. During the narratives analysis, we built the following themes: general conception about mathematics; teacher posture; the use of mathematics in everyday practices; ways to deal with mathematical contents; mathematical content mostly quoted; and emphasis on literacy. In addition, we discuss in this paper specifics mathematics contents from Pedagogy programs. The discussions converge to the role of teacher trainer when she/he is faced with the lack of time to address contents and methodologies of mathematics education and with the difficulties brought by her/him students since their basic schooling. Considering a training perspective, we emphasize the care with microaggressions related to mathematics contents and the meaning production related to mathematics teaching and learning. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Data consists of official national and institutional policy documents, as well as interviews conducted with nine former students, along with their school notebooks and tests. The theoretical and methodological framework draws on the work of Michel Foucault. It is argued that neoliberal market values are embedded in the mathematics education, through the articulation of abstract and formal reasoning with techno-scientific knowledge, for the purpose of competitive production.

To achieve that purpose, we used results of a previous research about mathematics problem solving, in which high school students were asked to solve a trigonometry question with two items. In the present work, questionnaires were answered by twenty high school teachers, who were asked to characterize the kind of the most representative errors found in that research, as well as to propose ways of intervention in mathematics teaching that could stimulate the students to critically think about their errors, in order to overcome them. The teachers' answers were analysed upon the light of two theoretical frameworks: the first deals with mathematical learning by using semiotic analysis, as proposed by Duval, and the second one is related to the teacher's knowledge, according to Shulman. From this analysis, we proposed a methodological design to the qualitative analysis of teaching activities in the pedagogical approach of problem solving in mathematics. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

We used as theoretical reference the Theory of Attitudes (Mann, 1981). The methodology applied was mixed and a Likert questionnaire-alpha 0.807-was applied as data collection instrument to 149 students and a semi-structured interview to 28 students. The findings show a high degree of student rejection towards the subject of Calculus, and the predominant manifestation of negative feelings to: the teaching methodology, the written exam as the predominant form of assessment, the learning activities, the teacher's attitude in the classroom, among other aspects inherent to the educational process. The analysis of the data obtained can help in the understanding of learning and teaching difficulties, as well as the implications of the negative attitude towards this discipline for achieving curriculum goals. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

However, what is the epistemological perception of math teachers on interdisciplinary practice? We use pros and cons statements about the interdisciplinary approach written by 56 educators, and in the light of discursive textual analysis, we seek to uncover the ways which teachers understand the interdisciplinary practice. We identify simplified and rudimentary conceptions of the surveyed teachers and found that these epistemological gaps make the teachers afraid to accept interdisciplinary practice in their daily practices, either by considering that mathematics would be devalued or by feeling isolated from other areas of knowledge. This study led us to believe that the initial and continuous training of teachers, within the interdisciplinary approach would favor the acceptance of interdisciplinarity in school for these teachers.","Epistemological Conceptions; Interdisciplinarity; Teachers Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006412447

Since the first Portuguese colonizers arrived to Brazil, the culture and costumes - including mathematical knowledge - and practices of Guarani and other indigenous people were considered inferior and unworthy. Considering this panorama and taking into account the multicultural features of Brazilian school, we present this article with the objective of analyzing the counting system and some graphical symbols of two Guarani tribes, the Itaty tribe, settled at the ""Morro dos Cavalos"" and M'Biguaçu tribe, located between the cities Palhoça and Biguaçu in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. This ethnographic case study was carried out through interviews with leaders of the Guarani tribes mentioned above. The present study is based on the theoretical principles of the ""Ethnomatematics Program"". The results of our analyses made evident that the counting system as well as the symbols employed are strongly correlated to these people's culture, thus playing roles both in quantification and in what we call in this paper as qualitative function.","Culture; Ethnomatematics; Guarani Graphic Symbols; Indigenous School Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006341810

In response to this new context, the federal government launched in 2007 a programme aiming at expansion of the enrolment to public higher education. In such environment of changes, several proposals have emerged to adapt the Brazilian federal universities to a new reality. Taking this context into account, the focus of our study is on proposals from the Mathematics Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Their aim is to create a new model of teaching practices for the freshman lessons of the Exact Sciences area, which at first were being experimented in special classrooms of students attending their first course on differential and integral calculus. The data were collected from interviews with students and professors from the mathematics department. They were analyzed and systematized using an activity theory approach. We became instigated by a model developed by Engeström in his study on the changes in the Finnish public health system, considering it as a test (testbench) for activity theory in its application to a particular case. Following Engeström's footsteps when developing his research, we arrived at our own model showing the internal tensions in the activity of reformulation of the courses offered by the Department of Mathematics and in the conceptions of teachers that promote – and constraint – the proposals for change. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Activity theory; Engeström; higher education; teaching of differential and integral calculus",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974800826

I highlight the educational significance in practicing DMP as an innovative process that integrates multimodality, playfulness, and creativity. In contrast, I have found that the production of DMP does not guarantee the in-depth connection between the math strands and processes of the Curriculum.

In this article, we intend to analyze some contributions that are traditionally credited to the Polytechnic School and contrast them with more recent research on these topics. We seek to ascertain the veracity of these reports associated with its mathematical productions and review the context in which they were published, including their repercussions and the results of recent studies. French contributions of the nineteenth century, including the late eighteenth century, were instrumental in the development of mathematics. The notion of rigor in mathematics was going through profound changes. The classical paradigms were faced with new conceptions emerging from the analytical method. The dissemination and application of the analytical method in geometry, mechanics, and infinitesimal calculus was a crucial step to elaborate many mathematical practices we have today. The mathematical analysis was slowly approaching the form it has developed nowadays. There is a very strong connection in the history of mathematics between the changes that happened during the late XVIII / beginning XIX century and the contributions of the French school. Our goal is to contrast some of the widespread myths about the school with the results established by the new historiography. New research on the history of the École Polytechnique (abbreviated as EP), particularly since the Bicentennial of the French Revolution, have revealed new sources in archives, with new methodologies. By supplementing the more recent investigations, we use the Journal de l'École Polytechnique in its first years, to seek publications directly from the school providing evidence for our claims.","History of Mathematics Education; Laplace; Monge; Relation between Teaching and Research; École Polytechnique",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941364562

Both ways apply in two engineering careers, for the sake of evaluating the effect that they cause in learning. The learning is focused as developer, in the sense of integrating the processes of internalization and exteriorization of knowledge.

Nine teachers from public and private primary schools in Rio de Janeiro gave their assessments with respect to mathematical proof and analyzed students' responses to two questions focusing on argumentation and proof of mathematical results. The research methodology undertaken was qualitative, accomplished through the application of forms and further analysis. This initial survey, used as a pilot for the research, indicates the teachers' preference for arguments approaching the academic model of mathematical proof, considering a more technical contact with this subject and the little experience of this content in the classroom. To answer the research questions, we will increase the sample forms and conduct interviews with some of the participants.","Argumentation; Mathematical Proof; Teachers' Knowledge on Mathematical Proof; Teaching-Learning of Mathematical Proof",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920571104

In this paper, the metacognitive aspect of an analysis model is presented in-depth. The goal, here, is demonstrating the role played by metacognitive processes to explain difficulties students have in solving problems. In order to do so, a case study involving a third grade student from Spain's high-school educational system is carefully examined. The subject answered a Metacognitive Skills Test, and, based on the analysis, the conclusion is that the difficulties students have might be related to either their cognitive or their metacognitive needs.","Cognition; Mathematics education; Metacognition; Problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901953614

To complement it, a study is also described of the impact of this intervention on the performance of students in a calculus course. An experimental design was used with an experimental group (EG) and a control (CG), with initial and final tests to evaluate performance. Students were classified based on the initial test into two categories (high rating - low rating), and it was established that the high rating students of the EG scored significantly higher in the final test performance than those of the CG (Mann-Whitney test was used). No differences were detected between subgroups of low rating groups. EG members had significantly higher scores than those of CG in Calculus's tasks (we used a Student's t test). These results suggest the design can be used with groups of students with high initial rating, while posing the problem of finding alternative strategies to teach students with low initial rating.","Calculus; Learning; Linear Algebra; Mathematical Symbol Systems (MSS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901948353

On the basis of the interpretative framework, an analysis is made of an excerpt of a regular elementary school class, a school level at which explicit mathematics reasoning rarely arises.

In the process of constructing mathematics portfolios, digital technologies are used as a resource, which in addition to favoring the establishment of new teaching practices, also attracts students to the school environment. The final product of this research is an application in flash format, which enables the understanding of the assessment instrument, in a dynamic and interactive manner. The model offers elements for a formative and summative assessment of students as well as information that allows the students and teachers to reflect on the learning process. Findings suggest that, using this instrument, students show evidence of constructing knowledge, using learning strategies, and willingness to keep learning.","Autonomy; Digital Technologies; Metacognition; Portfolio Mathematics; Reflective Assessment",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893656686

We noted that, in their first steps into DL, teachers barely used technological resources that typically assist in participants' interactions, and sometimes their practice reflected their face-to-face teaching. Mediations were perceived from the perspective of Activity Theory. This theory studies the subject in activity and their incorporation of new artifacts into their practice, which was constantly changing.

I explain how the Mexican educational system fails to accomplish one of its fundamental obligations: to ensure that the people it serves obtain the symbolic tools that are necessary for enhancing their mathematical thinking, and their ways of relating to the world.

The general discussion took place during the fifth meeting of the course. The qualitative data was collected through observations made during the meeting. The results suggest that the discussions among the participants converge on two aspects of the planning of the modelling environment: the planning of teachers' actions and the planning of the modelling task.

This research is classified as qualitative and the analysis was interpretative. The data consisted of questionnaires and interviews. It was observed that these future teachers do not perceive themselves as experts on specific topics that they are required to teach, such as: Operations with Fractions, Geometry, and Data Processing. It was concluded that, to encourage these future teachers to use methods, techniques and innovative materials and to promote better development of professional knowledge, it is necessary to balance the Theory x Practice equation throughout their university education, and that partnerships between universities and schools may be one way to achieve this.","Mathematics Teaching; Prospective Primary Teachers; Teacher Education; Teachers' Perceptions",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883729947

This analysis is one of the important practices in research education aimed at the study of phenomena that emerge in the learning/teaching process. In this article, we conduct an institutional analysis of projects related to the academic curriculum, textbooks and students as institutional elements of a higher education institution, considering multiple integrals as the object of study. But, how is an institutional analysis performed, and for what didactic purpose? These questions constitute the basic element of reflection in this article. The answers led us to conclude that an institutional analysis identifies the conditions and requirements that determine, in an institution, institutional practices related to objects of study required in the training of human resources. It encourages the development/organization of the didactic sequences aimed at studying the effective practices of people from the institution related to the objects of study proposed, thus contributing to the development of educational research.","Didactic Sequence; Institutional Analysis; Multiple Integrals; Praxeology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883697931

Rules are proposed for the operation of the primary objects and a game is described in which the factoring is operationalized using this framework. The game becomes the vehicle for understanding the difficult relations of the objects of factoring in the algebraic framework.

Only in 1867 was the rule demonstrated by Hankel as being the only one with the advantage of satisfying both left and right distributivity. Thus, Hankel solves the problem from the mathematical point of view when he uses the extension principle to apply the distributivity property, which has been used for many years with positive numbers, to negative numbers. This paper shows that this approach is still present in mathematics teaching today.

The study was carried out in a secondary school and consisted of an episode analysis related to a class discussion about the difference between plane figures and spatial figures. The data analysis was based on integration between some aspects of Polanyi's theory on tacit knowledge and Ernest's model of mathematical knowledge, with reference to its mainly explicit and mainly tacit components. This integration has involved not only the types of knowledge - mainly explicit or mainly tacit - the students used in a psychological way to perform a mathematical task involving conversation, but also and particularly how much the projection of those types of knowledge on the task were manifest tacitly or formalized by the students. Among the results of the research, a strong finding was that the lack of correspondence between the students' utterances and their original understandings is directly related to the manner in which the tacit co-operates with the explicit in the process of articulation. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2006.","Mathematical knowledge; Mathematical thought and speech; Mathematics learning; Tacit knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749378265

However, little is known about the different features and uses of this technology in Latin America. This Scoping Review asks how are educational AR systems designed, used and evaluated in the region, comparing this to the international literature. To address this question, we charted 36 conference papers and scientific articles, taking care of the quality gaps and methodological diversity within our sample. Our results show that, even though most converge on conventional research, design and pedagogical practices, engineering educators working at institutes are taking the lead of design, pedagogical and research innovation. Furthermore, we show that Latin-American literature distinctively reveals how teachers adapt to the particular contexts of teaching, and the special importance of the usually overlooked conference papers literature. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students’ self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators’ scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades. These results offer empirical support of self-assessment for learning and the use of poster construction as effective pedagogical strategies in science teacher education. © 2021, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.","Scientific poster; Scientific writing; Self-assessment; Teacher education; University-level science education",,"Philip Morris International, PMI","Support from PMI UCH1501-FIDOP 2016-36, PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003, and FONDECYT 1191069 is gratefully acknowledged.

This strategy explores the coherence between what the teacher intends to convey, what he imagines he conveys, and what his interlocutor (the student) conceives to be conveyed. In order to analyze the structural and functional quality of the instrumental component of the strategy, a study of its evaluation before a panel of experts is presented.

For data collection, task-based interviews composed of ten tasks applied to 21 Mexican students were used. The data analysis was carried out using the Thematic Analysis method. Results indicate that the students have several preconceptions in which they consider the slope as any of the following: an intersection with the X or Y-axis, an arithmetic operation, a length, an object, a height, and something to do. These findings pose the challenge of achieving conceptual changes from these preconceptions. In this sense, science education has been the field most exploited in mathematics education; a collaboration between teachers and researchers from both fields could contribute to finding strategies to face this challenge. © 2021","Seventh-grade; slope preconceptions; task-based interviews; thematic analysis",,,"Funding: No funding source is reported for this study.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122579994

Faced with this reality, this article discusses the theoretical aspects of the development of algebraic thinking, focusing on the continuing education of teachers who teach mathematics in the primary grades. In the light of the Historical-Cultural Theory, we present the conception of algebraic thinking as theoretical thinking mediated by algebraic concepts. In this journey, we discuss the concept of generalization from Davidov and layers of generality in Radford. Assuming that the solution to the algebra problem in the early years involves teacher education, we understand that it is essential that the teacher also recognizes, in formative processes, the use of semiotic resources to communicate his or her algebraic thinking. In this way, we analyze a proposal for a triggering situation for teacher education and discuss its potential for the development of algebraic thinking. We conclude that following the movement of substantial generalization and analytical work with indeterminate quantities can bring important contributions to the organization of pedagogical activity that aims to overcome purely arithmetic thinking in the development of algebraic thinking, understood as theoretical thinking mediated by algebraic concepts in a specific semiotic system of cultural signification. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Under a qualitative approach, as triggers of the production of meanings, we conducted semi-structured interviews with students regularly enrolled in the last semester of the Mathematics Degree course, from a public university in the countryside of Minas Gerais. From a plausible reading of the speeches of future Mathematics teachers, we observed different interlocutors, which allowed us to identify different ways of “being a mathematics teacher” constituted by them. In this article, we present such interlocutors, marking the difference in the meanings produced by the interviewed graduates. In our understanding, when undergraduate students in mathematics enunciated in different ways about “being a mathematics teacher”, in the same space-time, they did not contradict each other; they produced meanings that, for them, were legitimate within the activity in which they were placed. In this perspective, we argue that the initial training process may have been an opportunity for new graduates to be constituted by the undergraduate students. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

There is evidence that quantitative reasoning is related to the quality of the strategy used to solve word problems. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the relations between quantitative reasoning and word problem solving. Reading comprehension was also considered, due to its need to interpret the questions. With this, three distinct tasks were performed to assess the proposed skills: quantitative reasoning (QR), a reading comprehension task (RCT), and a word problem (WP). After verifying the correlation between the skills evaluated, a qualitative analysis was carried out on the strategies used to solve the word problem task. To this end, the sample was divided into four categories based on performance equal to or greater than 50%, or less than 50% in the tasks of QR and WP: 1) superior performance in both tasks; 2) superior performance in QR and inferior in WP; 3) inferior performance in QR and superior in WP; and 4) poor performance in both tasks. The sample was composed by 127 students of 3rd and 4th grades of elementary school from two public schools in Porto Alegre – Rio Grande do Sul. From the results, there was a significant relation between quantitative reasoning and word problem-solving, as well as, from the qualitative analysis it was found that the most efficient strategies occurred more frequently among students who had superior performance in both tasks. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The Historical-Cultural Perspective and Activity Theory were considered the theoretical references for the research. The constitution of the empirical data occurred through an open questionnaire, participant observation, field diary, productions of the participants throughout the development of the internship, and audio-video recordings of the interventions, conductors, and moments of reflections on these actions. With the analysis of the data, guided by the dialectical movement from the rise of the abstract to the concrete in the interrelationship between singular-particular-universal, of historical-dialectical materialism, there is a movement of appropriation of the Mathematics teaching activity in YAE, with highlights in the changes between motives, senses, and meanings in the formative process of being a teacher for this teaching modality. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The tracking of the information made it possible to identify some epistemological ruptures that directed the research to identify changes in the conception of the integral. The organization of the information made it possible to identify three periods: 1) The integral as an “operator”. 2) Evolution of the integration operation giving rise to integral calculus. 3) Foundations of integral calculus. Integral calculus was identified as a little explored field and normally considered complex. This proposal allows us to think of the integral not as a complex object, but as a mathematical entity made up of different meanings that must be decomposed to be studied.

We analyzed task instructions and resolutions of numerical expressions, their writing, and representation by diagram, in addition, multiplicative, and mixed problems. The problems approach the conceptual fields in a diversified way, with greater frequency of multiplicative situations of simple proportion. It is suggested that the work with numerical expressions be carried out with the use of diagrams and manifold situations, in order to provide the construction of the operation concept and the understanding of the rules of prevalence and the need for students to write association signs. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

To do this, we used some theoretical-methodological notions introduced by the Onto-Semiotic Approach to mathematical knowledge and instruction (OSA), which allowed both to characterize various meanings conferred on the t-Student statistic throughout its evolution and development, and to present a comprehensive perspective of what is considered inferential reasoning. The mathematical attributes of the t-Student statistics’ meanings are strongly linked to the indicators of the different levels of inferential reasoning presented here. Furthermore, each level is associated with informal, pre-formal, or formal inferential reasoning. The proposed levels of Inferential Reasoning for the t-Student statistic and its indicators are expected to be useful for the design of activities that gradually promote formal inferential reasoning based on informal inferential reasoning on this statistic. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The one-dimensional logistic model with three parameters was adopted, which establishes zero as the mean and a standard deviation of 1, for individuals’ proficiencies. The estimated proficiencies were transformed in another scale, opting for values adopted by Brazilian evaluation systems: 250 and 50. The measurement instrument consisted of a test with 36 items, with five alternatives each, only one of them correct, that were elaborated based on a reference matrix, divided into three themes, “Space and Form”, “Quantities and Measures”, and “Numbers and Operations, Algebra and Functions”. Each subject is composed of competencies, which describe the skills to be measured. To build the scale, proficiency levels were specified, representing points selected by the researchers to be pedagogically interpreted. Once the anchor levels are established, anchor items were defined based on some criteria, such as the number of correct answers, the percentage of correct answers and the difference between their values, for consecutive levels. Based on these criteria, three methods of items’ positioning were compared, showing the difficulties of interpretation in points of the scale. Such difficulties made it possible to propose another method, segmenting the scale into ranges of proficiency, based on hierarchical groupings of levels, which allowed the scale to be interpreted in all its breadth. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The work is part of the line of research in connection with models or compatible theories for the advancement of educational research. We analyze the structural description and objectives of EOS and Ethnomathematics, using Wittgenstein's theory as a foundation, we propose family similarities and establish relationships between them, taking postmodernist socio-epistemic theories. We apply the EOS didactic suitability indicators adapted to the Ethnomathematical perspective, expanding their scope by incorporating ethnomathematical components and indicators, testing an instrument capable of collecting the importance of context and sensitivity towards different cultures in teaching-learning proposals of mathematics and experimental science. We show the use of the instrument by its application to the assessment of a proposal on unconventional measurement patterns, implemented with Afro-descendant students of primary education in a public educational institution in the municipality of Tumaco, in Colombia. Compliance with the indicators is high, with outstanding optimal ecological suitability and epistemic suitability that can be improved.

In recent years, there has been increased attention to teaching prospective teachers to lead discussions with students. This paper examines the possibilities of designing a formative assessment that gathers information about prospective elementary teachers’ skills with leading problem-based mathematics discussions and makes sense of such information. A decomposition of the practice of leading discussions was developed and used to design the assessment. Nine first-year teachers who graduated from a range of different teacher education programs participated in the study. The findings reveal that our formative assessment works to gather information about teachers’ capabilities with leading discussions and that the associated tools support making sense of the information gathered. This suggests that such tools could be useful to support the formative assessment of the developing capabilities of prospective teachers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Assessment; Mathematics discussion; Practice-based teacher education; Prospective teachers; Teacher education",,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF: OPP1053743","This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under Grant No. OPP1053743.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120757935

Initially, we mention some aspects of teaching and learning of calculus in the literature, emphasizing studies that use the notion of humans-with-media to highlight the role of technology in mathematical thinking and knowledge production. Insights on the history of mathematics in calculus are also discussed. We developed a qualitative study based on three different solutions created by groups of teachers using the software GeoGebra and Microsoft Excel. All the teachers’ solutions improved the approximation (8/9)2≈ π/4, by determining p and q for (p/q)2≈ π/4. The first two solutions with GeoGebra emphasized experimentation and visualization, improving the approximation from one to three decimal places. The third solution with Excel pointed out the elaboration of a formula and improved it up to six decimal places. We emphasize how media shaped the strategies and solutions of the groups. Based on these solutions, we explore an approach for cubing the sphere, discussing approximations for π, highlighting the role of media in enhancing conceptual complexity in the solution of mathematical problems. The nature of the strategies for solving a problem is discussed, especially regarding different ways of thinking-with-technology developed by collectives of teachers-with-media.

The goal of this study is to describe what research results tell us about students’ learning of calculus of two-variable functions, and how they inform its teaching. In spite of the diversity of cultures and theoretical approaches, results obtained are coherent and similar in terms of students’ learning, and of teaching strategies designed to help students understand two-variable calculus deeply. Results show the need to introduce students to the geometry of three-dimensional space and vectors, the importance of the use of graphics and geometrical representations, and of thorough work on functions before introducing other calculus topics. The reviewed research deals in different ways with the idea of generalization concerning how students’ knowledge of one-variable calculus influences their understanding of multivariable calculus. Some research-based teaching strategies that have been experimentally tested with good results are included. Results discussed include the following: basic aspects of functions of two variables, limits, differential calculus, and integral calculus. The survey shows that there is still a need for research using different theoretical perspectives, on the transition from one-variable calculus to two-variable and multivariable calculus. © 2021, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Differential calculus; Functions of two variables; Integral calculus; Multivariable calculus",,,"This project was partially funded by Asociación Mexicana de Cultura A.C.","This project was partially funded by Asociaci?n Mexicana de Cultura A.C.",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100587297

In this paper I discuss results from a teaching design experiment for fostering meaning, using language support, in a middle grades mathematics classroom. I analyse the complexities and challenges that arise, as a way forward for purposefully relating with teaching practice. Following the design principles of connecting students’ language varieties and engaging them in rich discourse practices during lessons, in this paper I show that enabling shifts in classroom norms by moving from oral to written mathematics, and moving from private to public and shared expressions, fostered meaning making and empowered students’ mathematical communication.

The work was carried out in three phases: diagnostic, interventional and contrast, in addition, during the development of each test, interviews were carried out based on the tasks that the students solved. The results show that the initial solutions addressed a heuristic: identifying a recursive rule, which they used to find a missing term, the one they expressed in numerical, natural or iconic language, using extensive objects and arithmetic processes. The implementation of the proposal allowed the students a progressive increase in heuristic power in problem solving, giving varied and rich solutions to the activities that were presented to them, and some managed to generalize patterns using natural or symbolic-literal language. It can be concluded that the mathematical activity of most of the students is located between levels zero to two of algebrization, standing out, levels one and proto-algebraic of level two, solving problems of missing values, without modifying the expressions algebraic produced. © 2021 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

We consider various aspects of the teacher's specialised knowledge with respect to Thales's Theorem itself, as an element of teaching and learning, and to demonstrations, as a mathematical practice, in general. From this analysis, and guided by the Chilean syllabus requirement for this topic, we construct a snapshot of the interrelated elements of knowledge deployed by the teacher, which enables us to account for how he brings particular aspects into focus. The findings show that the utility which he attaches to the theorem, that of being able to apply it, alongside his view of it as a result of similarity and his emphasis on a numerical approach, is closely linked to his knowledge of registers, the interconnections he makes with other content items, his use of resources, the kind of tasks he sets up, and the knowledge of mathematical practices he makes evident. © 2021 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

The present study investigates the role played by another aspect of multiplicative reasoning: The one-To-many correspondence. This correspondence may be implicitly or explicitly mentioned in the wording of the problem. This study examined whether the degree of explicitness of the one-To-many relationship is an important factor in the solution of multiplicative problems, and whether the more explicit this correspondence is, the better the child s performance. With that in mind, 3rd and 5th grades elementary school students were asked to solve multiplication and division problems. In the wording of the problems, the one-To-many correspondence was presented in different degrees of explicitness. It was found that performance was better in problems in which the one-To-many correspondence was explicitly mentioned than in those in which this relationship was implicit, a fact observed in both school grades. Results show the facilitating role played by the explicitness of the one-To-many correspondence in the solution of problems of multiplicative structure.

After corrected, the tests are returned to the students with grades or concepts added. These evaluative feedbacks contribute little to students learning. On the other hand, formative assessments characterized by feedbacks more focused on learning, seem utopian, distant from the teacher s reality. The lack of time, the bloated curriculum, the lack of concepts related to a formative assessment or the absence of professional autonomy are barriers for the teacher to break the exam culture up, so incorporated in school systems. This article is an excerpt from a doctoral thesis on formative assessment, in which characteristics of formative feedback are discussed, presenting a pragmatic way of evaluating formatively. For this, an investigation was carried out with 51 professionals and students related to mathematics teaching, who corrected, assigned grades, and provided feedbacks for six different solutions to the same question. Initially, we propose a distinction between formative feedbacks and neutral feedbacks, then we investigate the connection between grading and the quality of feedback from teachers. This allows us to suppose that transforming school tests into evaluations with more formative characteristics may not be a utopia. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In this sense, there was the need of discussing the role that this material plays in this context, underlining which criteria and definitions should be regarded for its use, a debate that has not been performed by the Brazilian researchers yet. Thus, this article aims to investigate the use of original texts for mathematics teaching, through the stipulation of the definitions that permeate this material and the criteria listed for this use. Thereunto, a qualitative bibliographic methodology was adopted in order to select and analyze the literature on the subject, aiming at listing the criteria for the use of originals in the classroom and providing a theoretical base for the Mathematics educators that perform research in this field. Therefore, seven criteria were listed: material choice; the way of using it; the intentionality; the grade or level of application; the didactic treatment; the moment of using it; and the historiographical perspective chosen. These were the criteria listed in the period of execution of this research, but there is the possibility of listing new ones in another study, with different or further readings. However, with them, it was possible to conclude that, before using an original, it is necessary to consider the issues of using this material and, based on these selected criteria, it will be possible to consolidate this discussion and other researches on the subject. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

It starts with questions, such as: How can we not represent mathematics in art, nor instrumentalize mathematical education, but make it a philosophical experience with art and visuality? Without pretending to be able to answer, and with an analytical attitude, there is an overview that involves mathematics and learning through art, and thus produce knowledge about the connections between mathematics and art that tailor these types of learning. From this, a certain rhythm given to this in Mathematics Education stands out, demarcating a predominant matrix about learning mathematics through art. Then, in a mismatch, connections between mathematics and art are presented, from a critical learning perspective, visuality and the methodology of walking, taking as example a set of research works which shows that this can be elaborated in multiple ways, including diverse relationships between image and art and visual and mathematics and thought exercises. Finally, without being a model but a work in process, it is placed in a state of crossing with mathematics and art and visuality, in which learning becomes an event and a trans-formation. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

For this, a formative process was elaboratedbased on the perspective of professional teacher development and supported by the mathematics exploratory teaching approach, carried out with PIBID participants, specifically with mathematics graduates and basic education teachers. To achieve the objective of this work, a qualitative research of interpretive nature was carried out. As analytic parameters, we investigatedaspects related to the teachers' professional development, specifically, onthe subdomains of Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (BALL; THAMES; PHELPS, 2008). The conclusion is that the participants involved in the research mobilized/developed professional knowledge related to: Specialized Content Knowledge (SCK); Knowledge of Content and Students (KCS); and Knowledge of Content and Teaching (KCT). The practices that contributed to the mobilization/development of this knowledge were: choosing a challenging and interesting task for students; anticipating possible resolutions; knowingthe mathematical object in detail; explaining classdynamics; using a manipulable material; monitoring taskperformance; selecting the resolutions to be discussed in class; sequencing them as to provide a logical chain of ideas; maintaining a harmonious atmosphere for discussingmathematical ideas; and connectingthestudents responses. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Here, we sample evidence of discursive shifts observed as twelve mathematics teachers engage with a set of problematizing activities (PA) – three rounds of history-focused and mathtask combinations – during a four–month postgraduate course. We trace how the commognitive conflicts orchestrated in the PA triggered changes in the teachers’ narratives about: mathematical objects (such as what a function is); how mathematical objects come to be (such as what led to the emergence of the function object); and, pedagogy (such as what value may lie in listening to students or in trialing innovative assessment practices).

An online instrument designed and implemented for Chilean mathematics teachers, with a total of 423 math teachers participating. The instrument is found psychometrically valid to study teachers’ pedagogical-technological beliefs and their remote practices. The results show teachers’ high self-efficacy levels regarding the personal use of technology, but moderate selfefficacy in integrating technology in teaching. Moreover, teachers see a much more active role for themselves than for students in online activities. Gender differences were only significant for teaching practices, where the results reported women as more active than men. Teacher age is not recognized as a factor affecting teachers’ pedagogical-technological beliefs and their remotepractices. Finally, the study confirms a significant influence of socioeconomic context in teachers’ beliefs and practices during the pandemic.

Perspectives related to Financial Education, School Financial Education, and Critical Mathematical Education provided theoretical support for the study. As this is a qualitative research in which a bibliographic survey was carried out based on Capes' Theses and Dissertations Catalog, data production also considered the principles of content analysis. Through this platform it was possible to identify 333 master's or doctorate productions, using the keyword ""Financial Education"". After data were restricted, we selected six didactic research activities carried out in the professional modality and which developed these issues with high school students. For the analysis of activities, three descriptors were systematized, based on the studies by Muniz (2016) and Rocha (2017): Context Interpretation (D1), Decision Making (D2), and Argument in Decision Making (D3). For the activities considered, it can be highlighted that the research allowed its participants to reflect on everyday situations (identification of D1 in five activities), but the issues did not admit decision making based on the three arguments considered: Sociocultural (SC), economic-financial (EF), and behavioral (C). Therefore, it is proposed that the study of geometric progressions, strongly related to uniform periodic series, be conducted based on Financial Education and Critical Mathematical Education, still in High School. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Results suggest that the students resort to types of empirical arguments based on visual perceptions, leaving evidence of little organization of ideas in the development of their argumentative practice. Moreover, the application of the specific software tools played a role of argument for the student and not as support for their argumentation process.

The objective is to identify in teachers the epistemological conceptions that underlie the teaching of Mathematics and investigate if these conceptions are equivalent to those found in Brazil: Empiricists (substantiated sometimes by apriorists), and, rarely, constructivists. The general research objective will be pursued, in this text, by the specific objective: To know in which stage of human childhood teachers place the emergence of the necessary mathematical notions for the child to perform basic mathematical operations; and to what they attribute its genesis. For this, we analyze the answers to research questions 4 to 8, asked to teachers of all levels of education, through interviews. The responses given are similar to those of Brazilian teachers in relation to the predominance of empiricist conceptions founded by apriorist ones. Constructivist conceptions are found in only one of the seventeen research interviews. Teachers believe in the early appearance of basic mathematical notions, attributing them to environment pressure, through stimulation and repetition, configuring an empiricist conception; and, frequently, to genetic inheritance or maturation, configuring an apriorism, even innate. They confuse logical constructions, performed by the child from birth to about 7 or 8 years of age, with basic mathematical notions. They attribute its appearance to stimulation (based on maturation), with a devaluation of the subject's action and of their cognitive development process; they attribute to perception what is the merit of action and the coordination of the subject's actions within the process of reflecting abstraction. Teachers consider, therefore, the teaching process to be hegemonic over the learning process. The basic theoretical reference is Piaget's Genetic Epistemology. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

This is the problem that arouses the interest to investigate that network, a training space that included beginners, experienced, and future teachers who teach and will teach mathematics. The aim was analyzing expressions of geometric thinking of these teacher participants in this network. Such expressions were manifested through their records that revealed concerns related to (1) the role of language and representations in geometry classes; (2) the defining attributes of geometric figures (3) the location and movement in space. This research is qualitative and uses data built in discussion forums, in which an online dialogue was established. Through the identification of the expressions of geometric thought, we indicated, for the area of teacher training that teach Mathematics, a training proposal with teachers that starts from their practices, beliefs and/or conceptions, in order to create an environment that enable reflection on what is done and how it is done. It was understood that teacher training goes beyond the explanation and presentation of mathematical concepts to the participants, of alternative teaching methodologies, carried out by trainers.

For model elaboration, we used preliminary information about the function concept, as: A brief historical evolution of the concept; some difficulties in the teaching and learning processes; its organization in the Brazilian curriculum documents; and a praxeological analysis of a textbook used in the researched subject. As a theoretical basis for the elaboration of our REM, we used: A proposal by Lucas applied to the concept of elementary differential calculus; the mathematical modelling notion of Chevallard and Gascón and the functional modelling levels proposed by Ruiz-Munzón. With this organization, we proposed a schema of a REM for the function concept, that fundamented the application of Study and Research Path (SRP), which was applied by the teacher of the Functions I discipline to his students over a period of six sessions. During the application process, we were able to observe the development of the SRP fundamented by REM, which presents itself as a possibility for teaching the function concept. We highlight the transition process from discrete to continuous domain, as well as the study of families of functions. The results showed that the techniques do not take a prominent role in relation to the understanding of concepts, causing a change in the teacher's perspective on how to teach and facilitate learning of the function concept. © 2021 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

To improve teaching genetics and the students' representational competence within the classroom have been proposed using multiple representations. This study presents an analysis of representational levels used by high school students learning Mendelian genetics and determining the construction trajectories of these representations. An assessment instrument was used to analyse the representational levels of 186 students with three different teaching strategies. The levels were used to analyse and classify students' answers, written texts, and drawings and diagrams. The result shows that learning Mendelian genetics is a gradual process in which students appeal to various levels of representations that can determine different trajectories and demonstrate progress on comprehension. We identify five trajectories, ranging from responses that rely on descriptions of observable traits to responses from students who could integrate processes or use models. © 2021 the authors; licensee Modestum.

We present theoretical reflections, results of empirical research, and description of innovative experiences with preand in-service biology teachers. Regarding argumentation, we analyse what defending a claim in science entails for teachers, the teaching strategies they (would) use in the classroom in relation to argumentation, the relevance that they attribute to the performance of different tasks for arguing, the subject content where argumentation fits more suitably, and the reasons they would consider in favour of arguing in science classes. For the analysis of educational practices that involve use of technologies, we adopt a perspective that looks at their complexity and recognises teachers as their creative authors.

However, little research has been done on inductive reasoning as it applies to teaching mathematical concepts in secondary school. Therefore, the study explores secondary school teachers’ perceptions of inductive reasoning and interprets this mathematical reasoning type in teaching the quadratic equation. The data were collected from a questionnaire administered to 22 teachers and an interview conducted to expand their answers. Through the thematic analysis method, it was found that more than half the teachers perceived inductive reasoning as a process for moving from the particular to the general and as a way to acquire mathematical knowledge through questioning. Because teachers have little clarity about inductive phases and processes, they expressed confusion about teaching the quadratic equation inductively. Results indicate that secondary school teachers need professional learning experiences geared towards using inductive reasoning processes and tasks to form concepts and generalizations in mathematics. © 2021 Sriwijaya University.

The findings in this research are four notions for the social construction of mathematics knowledge found in a qualitative historical-epistemological analysis of the original works of nineteenth century scientists. These notions consider transversal aspects from the scientists’ works: the use of analogies from heat to electricity give mathematical support to their findings; the shift from a static to a dynamic paradigm about electricity; the concern of a steady state as the situational context in which the knowledge was built; and the presence/confrontation of an epistemological obstacle. We propose that these conditions can be used to broaden the meanings overshadowed by mathematics courses in schools that primarily promote the operational aspect of mathematics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engineering education; Mathematics education; professional training; socioepistemology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083655594

This is due to the impossibility of expressing, in terms of simple elementary functions, the solutions of the nonlinear differential equation (NLDE) that models the pendulum, which is why the authors usually choose the linearized differential equation arising from the sin θ ≈ θ approximation for small angles θ. In this article, we use the computational power of Mathematica software and take advantage of its capacity to graphically show the solutions of the NLDE. In this manner, we determine approximations of the periods that result from varying the initial amplitude θ 0, without assuming that it takes small values. From a comparison of the solutions of both types of modelling of a simple pendulum, a criterion for deciding how small θ 0 must be for the linear equation to be adequate for modelling is obtained; this comparison includes an analysis of the pendulum′s motion when the cable length and the gravitational acceleration constant are varied. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital technology in mathematics; digital technology in mathematics education; mathematical modelling; Simple pendulum; teaching of differential equations",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076131100

For this purpose, we explored the concept of learning within the SLS, focusing on key aspects for this research, such as the concepts of social community and community of practice. From this discussion, we articulated these theoretical assumptions to learning about pedagogical practice with Mathematical Modelling using descriptions and analysis of classroom episodes and interviews developed with fourth-year students of Mathematics Degree at a public university in Paraná in 2015. The descriptions are presented in order to relate the participation of two undergraduate students in social communities to their pedagogical learning practice with Mathematical Modelling.

The activity, implemented at the beginning of the semester of Economics for an Engineering course, aimed to identify how students project and, above all, justify the behavior of stock prices using (or not) micro or macroeconomic elements. More precisely, using the theory of semiotic representation registers, this work is dedicated to the interpretation of a particularly curious phenomenon identified among the descriptions presented by students: The use of the word constant (and its derivations) to qualify the behavior of graphs that are in fact not constant in the literal and mathematical sense of the term. The results, when compared with the previous literature that identified the tendency of students to produce linear graphs, differ because they indicate something opposite, even due to the nature of the proposed activity. Students did not produce linear graphs that adhered to their textual descriptions, indicating difficulties in conceptualizing and coordinating distinct semiotic representation records. On the other hand, when the results are compared with studies that identified a tendency to simplify or smooth graphs, it was observed in the present study a tendency to simplify, flex or conceptual and semantic smoothing of the word constant. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In Latin America, there are some studies about the attitudes of math teachers, but they are not very abundant. This work is intended to contribute to this body of studies by comparing two contexts inserted in the educational systems of Spain and Colombia. The objective is to analyze the set of beliefs and attitudes towards Mathematics, that teachers of basic education report, with special interest on anxiety. It is based on the validation and contextualization of the questionnaire on beliefs and attitudes towards mathematics. The methodology of the Classical Test Theory was followed. A pilot test was applied to calibrate the instrument; It was then administered to a sample of 232 teachers in both countries. With the data obtained, a comparative analysis was carried out to identify similarities and differences between the groups. The results show epistemological similarities regarding the items related to Euclideanism. However, in terms of quasi-empiricism and constructivism, there are marked differences by country. In relation to anxiety, teachers' responses differ depending on the geographical context. It highlights the higher level of anxiety of Spanish teachers compared to Colombians. It was proved that factors such as the educational level and recruitment type determine your anxiety level and your belief system. In the future, it would be useful to verify whether anxiety levels also affect teaching practice during the teaching of mathematics. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

From those aspects, we suggest the idea of the balance degree between them, that is, to solve a problem now, but with general and longer-term support. The characterization of video tutorials in different teaching modes could help the teachers' choice of videos, according to their needs, decisions should be different. Besides we must not only consider the teachers' view, but the potential increase in active and autonomous participation of students using properly chosen videos. To show the implication of our analysis, we compare the production of videos of well-known Spanish-speaking authors who exert great influence.

As an applied nature, it was developed under a pedagogical intervention for data collection and analysis. The eight participants were adult students, aged 19 to 47 years old, who attended a special education school in a city in the countryside of the state of Paraná - Brazil. The data was analyzed through assessment of the conversation. The students with intellectual disabilities participating in the study had limited knowledge regarding the use of numbers and operations in school situations and in different contexts of everyday life, so these concepts were taught to them. After the pedagogical intervention, they showed advances in this knowledge, appropriating both the concept of numbers and the use of soroban as a tool for performing mathematical calculations. As it is a human right to appropriate the knowledge produced historically and culturally by mankind, which in turn leads to development, teaching the use of soroban to students with intellectual disabilities promoted the learning of mathematical concepts, developing superior skills such as thought, defending the thesis proposed by this study that cognitive limitations of the intellectually disabled are not barriers to learning of an array of educational concepts. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Some of these interpretations emerged from the teaching practice of prospective mathematics teachers and from a supervised teaching practice course on mathematics. The paper is part of a doctoral research on the learning of dialogue by prospective teachers. The theoretical framework is based especially on the dialogue concept proposed by Alrø and Skovsmose in the context of critical mathematical education. The research data are episodes from teaching practices, when the prospective teachers tried to put into action the dialogue with the students, and also from moments of reflection on these practices, which favored to address dialogue learning. This paper argues that it is impossible to exhaust the concept, considering the multiplicity and transience of the dialogue.

The analysis, following techniques typical of ethnomethodology, was done in terms of: (i) intelligibility and authenticity, (ii) features of the discourse proposed by Sfard and (iii) our conceptualization of collective voice and shared voice. We found a geometry classroom in which student voices are collectively constructed and generate shared meaning about intersection, which is reflected in a punctual discursive transition.

Research was carried out in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo), Electronic Psychology Journals Portal (PePSIC), and Higher Education Personnel Coordination Journals (Capes) databases, from the descriptors: ""Matemática"", ""Matemática and aprendizagem"", ""desempenho escolar"", ""desempenho and aritmética"", and ""aritmética"". To select the material, the following criteria were defined: The papers should be articles from empirical research reports, using a correlational design and presenting statistically significant results (p < 0.05). The studies should also have been conducted with Brazilian students with typical development. At first, the search resulted in 1.391 works, of which 16 met the criteria. Among the cognitive skills investigated are linguistic, metacognitive, intelligence, memory, among others. From the results presented, we determined the magnitude of the correlations of each skill in learning mathematics and the practical application of the findings. It is concluded that the investigated capacities demonstrate weak to strong magnitudes. In addition, researchers point out the importance of primary school teachers understanding the importance of these skills, what they can do to stimulate them, and the need to promote programs aimed at stimulating cognitive skills. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Based on modelling in mathematics education studies and on the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), we could interpret the mathematization process as a set of actions oriented to the activity system object, and the modelling project objective as the activity object itself. We concluded that the mathematization process, permeated by tensions, took place concurrently with the delimitation of the modelling project objective, which caused a series of advances and setbacks in the subjects' actions. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The APOS notions of Schema and schema development in terms of the intra-, inter-, and trans-triad are used to analyze semi-structured interviews with 25 students who had just finished taking a single-variable calculus course. Results suggest that the notions of chain rule and implicit function play a key role in the possibility of attaining implicit differentiation Schema coherence. For this, students need to construct at least a Process conception of implicit function and a chain rule Schema with coherence given by function composition. Students also need to construct relations between implicit function and each one of three components of the implicit differentiation Schema: explicit function, derivative, and differentiation rules. The study shows that students taking an introductory calculus course can be expected to have difficulty understanding the main ideas of implicit differentiation unless special activities are designed to help them make the necessary connections between components of the implicit differentiation Schema. The study suggests the need to further investigate the implementation of activities that foster the constructions proposed, in textbooks and classrooms. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","APOS; Calculus; Chain rule; Genetic decomposition; Implicit differentiation; Schema triad",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092383152

In this sense, we present a study that consists on the observation of the management of two teachers who have faced the teaching of Euclid's Theorems in their second-year courses in Middle Education in Chile. To this end, direct observation of the classes was carried out and both teachers were subsequently interviewed. For the analysis of pedagogical management, we used Guy Brousseau's Theory of Didactical Situations (TSD), specifically focusing on the notions of didactical contract, didactical milieu, and the processes of devolution and institutionalization. The methodology used in the study is qualitative, descriptive, and interpretive, where extracts of episodes from a class are retrieved. The analysis reveals numerous didactical paradoxes that do not favor the learning of the students in relation to the foreseen objectives, nor to the mathematical objects treated in class.

The theoretical contributions that underpin the investigation are the theories of Michel Foucault, especially the concepts of discourse and statement. The research material is composed of interviews with teachers of the 3rd or 4th year in the private school network of Porto Alegre. The analytical strategy used to examine the material was guided by the discourse analysis from Michel Foucault's perspective. The material examination evidenced the presence of two statements constituting the discourse of Mathematical Education in the Early Years: ""the importance of the use of concrete material and digital resources in Mathematics classes"" and ""the relevance of the registration and formalization of mathematical knowledge as a guarantee of learning"". Thus, it can be concluded based on the interviews carried out, that mathematics teaching in the Early Years is supported by statements that are part of different discursive fields, but predominate those based on Platonic constructivism and ideals, leading the pedagogical processes in an ascending way: concrete materials for systematization and formalization, making this final stage as the most relevant and capable of ensuring learning. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The sample consisted of sixteen teachers in training who self completed the self efficacy measurement instrument ""Preparation in the use of technology to teach mathematics"" which consists of a battery of 6 dimensions and 23 ordinal variables in the scale of 0 to 10. Two measurements were carried out, the first one at the beginning and the second one right after the course. Nonparametric tests were performed for data analysis: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the Kruskal Wallis test, the Mann Whitney U test, and theWilcoxon test. The results indicate age, professional experience, and gender as non significant variables on pre service teacher self efficacy in the use of technology for teaching mathematics. Statistically, there were significant differences between self efficacy ranges before and after course implementation. Pre service teachers reported feeling prepared to use technology for teaching.

The experience takes place within the Indigenous Inter cultural Bachelor's degrees of the Community University of the Chapecó Region (Unochapecó), in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The text includes both the description of a pedagogical experience that is framed in the ethnomathematical paradigm, as well as the propo sal of a specific ethnomathematical hypothesis, about the Kaingang people's kinship system. The postulation of the hypothesis was a necessary moment within the pedagogical experience, since there were no significant studies on the cited culture that would serve as ethnomathematical material for the classes, so we thought it would be interesting to investigate that area in order to obtain the cited material. The conjecture specifically postulates that the Kaingang kinship system can be expressed in the forma l language of a predicate logic. This allows us to interpret the reasoning with which kinship relations (marriage, affiliation, inheritance) are calculated as algorithms, that is, as resolutions of problems in a finite and unambiguous number of steps. The hypothesis also provides that the system can be expressed as a computer program. In addition to presenting the experience together with the specific hypothesis, the work describes how it was used in the training of indigenous teachers and evaluates its res ults. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

According to the research problem ""How is structured knowledge related to mathematical analysis?"", we aim to understand the process of constructing real knowledge analysis, in history and comparing the cognitive subject development, according to the genetic epistemology perspective. For this, we studied the history of mathematics from its main references, and Piaget's theory. As a result, it was observed that the course that culminated in the current formalization of the analysis occurred in four stages: development of differential and integral calculus; organization of this calculus; analysis of this calculus; arithmetization of this analysis. Each of these stades parallels the notion of developmental stage, and the main difference between these stages would be the level of conceptualization. It is concluded that the learning of analysis takes place through successive moments of taking the awareness process that culminate in conceptualization. This implies that to present axioms and establish properties and theorems from them does not consist of a potential teaching activity, except for those students who already have reached the cognitive level necessary to carry out these assimilations and, therefore, the answer was already in the subject before. For those who have not reached that level, it is necessary to act on mathematical objects so that, from this action, the process of taking awareness of the concerned actions may occur. The aim was to contribute to broadening the debate about mathematics education in higher education, favoring a democratization of learning mathematics at all levels, including the most formal ones. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The objective of the study was to find the underlying constructs, as well as items in Ibarra-González and Eccius-Wellmann's Affectivity towards and due to Mathematical Errors questionnaire that correlate significantly with the score on a diagnostic assessment of mathematics. Regarding the constructs, the study found that evaluation scores depended on attitudes towards errors as a learning tool and negative beliefs and emotions towards mathematics due to making mistakes. The items corresponding to the aforementioned constructs revealed that the students grade decreases according to the intensity of the student's belief that he is not by nature good at mathematics. This belief lead to making more mistakes and a lack of interest in correcting them, influencing scores negatively. Based on the results, we see the need to promote a change in the pejorative connotation of error to reduce negative beliefs towards mathematics due to making mistakes and to use errors efficiently for pedagogical purposes. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The relationship between mathematics and threatening situations is called math anxiety (MA), which is a feeling of tension and mental disorganization when number manipulation is required. It is a consequence of genetic and environmental predictors, but may also be associated with poor working memory (WM) performance and inhibitory control (IC). The aim of this study was to demonstrate the size effect of MA on performance in WM tasks, and to investigate the strength and significance of correlations between MA, WM, and IC. A new hypothesis test was performed with data from articles that have the same pattern of statistical information, comparing groups with high and low MA. The software R, version 3.6.4, and the packages Revmeta, Metafor, and Forest were used. The size of the effect of MA on WM was SMD = 0.22, CI = 100%, 0.38; 0.07]; p = 0.01, demonstrating that there is a significant difference between the WM means for groups with high and low MA. However, a high heterogeneity index (I2= 81%) was found, which shows little robustness about the variety of our data. Groups with high levels of MA have been shown to have higher error rate and reaction time in irrelevant stimulus inhibition tasks, which shows difficulties in resisting interference while performing mathematical tasks presented by these individuals. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Data were collected through participant observation supported by audio and video recording of the classes. After transcription, data were analyzed in four categories of teacher actions: invite; guide/support; inform/suggest, and challenge. Data analysis concerns that the actions carried out by the teachers in whole class discussions favored the student's processes of conjecture formulation, comparison, identification of patterns, and justification. The results achieved by this study provide evidence to the relevance of the teachers' actions for the development of mathematical reasoning since the early years. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The discussion is related to a mathematical content that is taught in the basic school and to the manifestation of the subjects regarding their responses to a certain activity. In this research, of a qualitative character, the instruments of data collection were the subjects’ textual production, the observations made by the authors and annotated in a field diary, as well as an online questionnaire. As theoretical contribution, we made use of methodologies that emerge from the Error Analysis theory, aiming to classify the errors committed for further discussion and reflection in the group. The results indicate that the participants perceived as relevant the carried-out reflection, because they expressed the recognition that it is fundamental for the teacher to take into account the students’ mistakes in their classroom activities. The fragility of the argumentation in mathematics among these teachers was verified as well, and this reinforces the need for these professionals to embrace in-service teachers’ education. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Santa Catarina has already had 35 editions of the fair and, recently, has been standing out on the national scene. In this Movement, the evaluation process has always been controversial due to the indication result of the works and the qualitative description made by the evaluators. Thus, this article sought to understand the meanings that emerge from the evaluation records of the works exhibited at the Fair, based on the evaluation purposes defended in the Movement. It is a qualitative and interpretative research, which investigation process took place through documentary study. The data are made up of the assessment forms that are part of the final report of two Regional Mathematics Fairs held in 2017. Thus, 225 assessment sheets from 71 works were analyzed, through the procedures of the Textual Discursive Analysis (ATD). From the analysis, four categories emerged describing the meanings of the evaluation: evaluation as a means to validate/verify, to measure, to disqualify, and to suggest/propose. It was identified that the evaluations focus on the purposes of examining and rating and that the propositional considerations, characteristic of a formative evaluation, are causally related to the evaluator's conception. We conclude, therefore, that it is necessary to constantly invest in the training of guiding teachers and evaluators who participate in the Movement. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

It explores the language and subversion of academic writing norms, combining form and content to produce meaning. Some passages are written in chronicles. The considerations metaphorically express the synthesis of the challenges of pedagogical coordination and discuss education through the experience/sense pair, as suggested by Jorge Larrosa, the theoretical reference of this work. The methodology consists of going from conversations, from the coordinators’ narratives, to a thought-oriented conversation, through research on other contexts of coordination, expressed here in footnotes. And then, making a resignified return for the pedagogical and curricular experiences, through the chronicles. It is concluded that it is necessary to think about training each and every person to use mathematical knowledge. This requires boldness and utopia, it requires the coordinator to avoid traps, subversion, and creativity, in order to escape the technical curriculum in favor of human dignity. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The social, economic, and technological changes of the contemporary world impose on the educational system the need to develop new models of teaching and learning. The objective of this study was to compare, in two classes of students, the method of expository teaching and project-based learning concomitantly with traditional teaching. We used a experimental design with the teaching method as an independent variable, and as independent variables, the motivation to learn, attitudes towards mathematics, and school performance. The results found were: in motivation to learn and attitudes in relation to mathematics no significant differences between the teaching methods were found. Regarding school performance, one of the classes that used project-based learning had a better performance than the one which used the method of expository teaching. The results indicate that project-based learning is a feasible teaching method in basic education with results slightly higher than the traditional teaching method. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In this sense, this paper aims to analyze the contributions of a pedagogical practice developed on Stochastic education in early childhood education using Bruner's theory of education. This pedagogical practice was used in two classes in the age group of 3-5 years. Several data were collected through textual, photographs, and video recordings. The textual data were retrieved from teachers' narrative inquiry. The analysis was performed through the Discursive Textual Analysis methodology. The results suggest that the pedagogical practice lead to an advance in the children's intellectual development, enabling their learning through discovery, reaching all children, and promoting their development of stochastic concepts. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

However, little is known about its underlying neural mechanisms. We provide a Systematic Review of studies that have investigated the neural correlates of Mathematical Anxiety in the last decade and discuss its implications for the teaching-learning process. We selected studies that made brain measurements of individuals with Mathematical Anxiety through electronic databases, considering the delineated inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the literature was analyzed from the 11 items of the PEDro quality scale and conducted by the selection flowchart of PRISMA studies, resulting in the inclusion of 13 neuroscientific studies. In general, literature suggests that neural bases of fear and pain are stimulated by Mathematical Anxiety before and during numerical tasks. There is a reduced capacity for Working Memory and Attention Deficit / Inhibition in individuals with high Mathematical Anxiety. They are also more likely to make mistakes in mathematical tasks, have less precise representations of numerical magnitude, approach math problems differently from their less anxious peers, and tend to raise more cognitive control resources to complete goals with aversive stimuli, processing efficiency and generating performance deficits. Results also support that the effects of Mathematical Anxiety are associated with less cortical activation during the initial stages of numerical stimuli processing, regardless of task complexity. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

How does KQ contribute to the professional knowledge constitution of a teacher who teaches mathematics? These researches highlight the potential of KQ through the qualitative approach and use of videos. Contemplating all dimensions and codes has been the most common practice, with emphasis on the contingency dimension.

However, controversial results still characterize this field of investigation and, therefore, it is necessary to research for a better understanding of the associations between PS and academic achievement, as well as the relationship between PS and working memory (WM), another fundamental cognitive domain. In order to contribute to this debate, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of correlation (Spearman) between PS and the following variables: a) numerical competence performance (arithmetic and number sense); b) reading performance; c) working memory (central executive component); d) frequency in the use of arithmetic-fact retrieval strategies; e) number of correct fact retrievals. The research involved 60 students, in the 5th and 7thyears of Elementary School, with average and low performance in arithmetic and reading. The results showed significant and negative associations (less time = higher speed) between the variables, so that PS is associated with both numerical and reading competence, as well as with WM and with the variables related to the fact retrieval strategy. These data indicate that a weakness in PV may become a risk factor for the development of difficulties in those areas. Some educational implications are highlighted as well as the need for more evidence relating the interventions in PS and WM and the performance in arithmetic and reading. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

To analyze the collaboration in this activity, we relied on the idea of subjectivity coming from the Theory of Objectivation (RADFORD, 2014). Through an interpretative analysis of the moment in which a student communicates to others the technique used by them to build a semicircle with GeoGebra, it was possible to identify the presence of responsibility, commitment, and care for the other, as the three forms of collaboration produced in the SDG. In addition, the analysis identified how one of the teachers promoted some of these forms of collaboration in the students. The findings suggest that the way of managing technique communication, individualistic culture in school, and the students' resistance to change were the three aspects that influenced the manifestation and promotion of these forms of collaboration. © 2020 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Throughout most of the twentieth century the conventional understanding has been that modern democracies are secular democracies, with little attention devoted to parsing the competing strains and dissenting elements of various forms of secularism. The feature story has been the clean and principled divide between the secular public and the private religious, which theists and atheists could presumably embrace regardless of their differing assessments of the fate and fortunes of religion. At a minimum the secular public was explicitly focused on the institutions and authority of the state, in distinction from those of religion. But this relatively circumscribed rendition of secularism attending to religion/state formations mingled with other more comprehensive renditions that positioned secularism as a supercessionary alternative to religions. Secularism remained secure, so long as the consensus that religion belongs within the private sphere remained in place” (2010, 4).",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096507895

The results are considered relevant, especially when eleven of the participants without experience of sexual practices present theoretical and scientific knowledge. Formal and emancipatory sex education can contribute to the psychosocial and affective development of gifted adolescents. © 2020","Gifted Adolescents; Giftedness; Sexual Education; Sexuality",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096471095

The objective of our research was to use this relationship between emotion-belief to identify, in addition to professed beliefs, beliefs implicit in the appraisal cognitive reported in daily self-reports on the class experiences of two higher-level teachers. We identified two types of implicit beliefs: referring to learning and management in the classroom.

This process has been described as algebrization of school mathematics education, which even extends beyond the activity of Arithmetic itself, and also covers the didactics of Geometry, Mathematical Analysis, and Statistics. The following work constitutes a reflexive contribution about possible didactic proposals that do without the work with procedural generalizations, or algorithms, and of the use of different languages and representations corresponding to the Algebra. To overcome the described situation that emphasizes algebraic teaching, it is suggested to approach Arithmetic in the aulic context of production of significant knowledge (linked to constructivism) in collaborative work between student peers.

The emotional drive behind this article is expressed in the following questions: How is it possible to look for concrete exclusionary school practices that qualify some and disqualify others without realizing that promotion/exclusion only becomes effective when a certain symbol is officially attached to the name of a student? How is it possible not to notice that promotion/exclusion can only be based on assessment-evaluation of mathematical content ability? How is it possible that mathematics education literature never broaches the consequences of assessment-evaluation on the lives of the students? We argue that these are not due to a temporary blindness of mathematics education research, but, rather, that we are dealing with a symptom.

The analysis was based on the theoretical framework of the cognitive structure of emotions. It states that emotions are caused by the person's interpretation of the consequences for their goals, norms and attitudes of events, other people's actions and their relationship to objects, respectively. The change in attitude was analyzed by means of the report of Frida's emotional experiences throughout a school year, in which she attended two math courses and one-on-one counseling classes. The results indicate that the change in attitude began when her reactions were not in the sense suggested by the theory for emotions of the same valence (based on goals, norms and attitudes), but in the opposite sense. That is, Frida, during the counseling courses, began to de-structure a negative attitude toward learning mathematics due to new evaluations of agents and events based on her personal norms and goals.

The interest in recording that activity, based on the recognition of the importance of SBEM for Brazilian Mathematical Education, is the main motivation for the writing of this text. In this article, we develop a discussion about our society's involvement with the construction of a scientific community in Mathematics Education. Based on one of the speeches given at the event, we aim to discuss the SBEM's relationships with teaching mathematics and with the formation of mathematics teachers from historical-political movements that mark the trajectory of the society, particularly the engagement of its subjects with collective responsibilities at different times, including the times yet to come. We hope that the understandings elaborated in this and other texts presented in this round-table discussion, which will be published in other editions of BOLEMA, contribute to share and evaluate our actions as a Society, constituting and thinking our collective memory and our historical accumulation to face the challenges of our time. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The solution to this problem, proposed by much of the mathematical educators' community around the world, was to promote the introduction of algebraic concepts since the early school years. The aim of this work was to describe and analyze the operational invariants used by third grade students elementary school in situations involving the notion of algebraic balance. The methodology of data production and data analysis used was the handling-formalization clinical method.The subjects were 24 third grade students of elementary school, which were submitted to an activity involving four weights and two scales. The participants should balance the weights two-by-two, without knowing the extent of one of the unknown weights the algebraic problem. Clinical interviews were held with all participants to investigate the operational invariants used by them to solve the problem. The theoretical research framework is the theory of conceptual fields. It was noted the possibility of using four operational invariants: the theorems-in-action ""complete the missing amount"" and ""find the unknown from the balance""; and related concepts-in-action ""sequence without numbers that repeat"" and ""balance weights on the scale"". The knowledge of how the child develops the initial algebraic balance notion, which is the beginning of the process of understanding the formal equation concept, can help early years teachers to create activities that stimulate the development of this algebraic ability. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Here, we present a training bias that recognizes teachers' estrangement as a triggering factor for the formative movement of sixteen teachers, in the theme of fractions as a school content. The analysis is based on the formative possibility of a four-hour meeting, which had as a starting point the perplexities of the teachers when they were asked what is familiar to each one of them when talking about the understanding of fraction. In a phenomenological posture, estrangement stands out as a philosophical attitude that moved the formation, allowing the arising of questions about school content and its teaching. In this perspective, the teachers' ""realization"" about the predominance of the technique and formal nomenclatures, with which they were launched to the attribution of fractional meanings, having as proposal the location in a number line. The study revealed the importance of a formation style in which the teacher is called by the anxieties that appear in the dialogue with their peers.

Ninth grade students in a comfortable position from a private school in a small town in São Paulo participated in a study group, applying trigonometric properties of the right triangle to plan accessible facilities for people with disabilities and impaired mobility. Data were gathered from the students' and the author's diaries, and answers to a reflective questionnaire. Results show it is possible to achieve goals of teaching Mathematics for social justice: reading and writing the world with Mathematics, succeeding academically, changing one's orientation to mathematics and bolstering the individual's social agency. Concerning limits, the small scale of the study group, difficulties that demanded the teacher's assistance and the limited time the participants had for the activity stood out.

The present work investigates features of the structure of the classroom in a course on Statistics from the Psychology graduation curriculum. For such purpose, we set the didactic contract as a theoretical guide, a “lunette” that allowed for observing the functional dynamics of the classroom, searching aspects that might be related to difficulties in the teaching-learning process. To enhance the analysis of the dynamics of the courses' performance, we carried out a comparative overview with a discipline having the usual structure characteristic from the Psychology graduation curriculum. This study is based not only on video-graphic registers of the classes, but in interviews with its professors as well. The compiled data was submitted to a clinical-interpretative analysis, pointing to several differentiation factors between the two disciplines, among them: classroom dynamics and evaluation systems. Specific to the Statistics course, important aspects appeared as negative interferences to the learning process, such as excessive manipulation of mathematical/statistical algorithms without the aid of informatics and computed data-processing.

We undertake some interpretations through a reading using the theoretical lens of said theory in which aspects related to mathematical and didactic organizations were evidenced. In this perspective, our analysis will be based on the descriptive protocol of the class and demonstrate how the TAD can contribute to design an organizational structure of a mathematical object, as well as to reveal gaps linked to the absence of the raison d'être of this content institutionally present in the curricular matrix of this educational level. The documentary analysis, in a qualitative approach was used in this study that followed a configuration and transit through some records of the class transcription and allowed us to weave interconnections with what the TAD postulates.

Inclusion implies the offer of enrollment and full access to the school curriculum, with the necessary adaptations. However, in general, this is not the case, since many pedagogical actions, often supported by an idea that students with ASD cannot learn, still engage in exclusionary practices that do not take into account the singularities of these students. In order to counteract this view and to present alternatives that can contribute to the ASD students' has full access to the school curriculum, this paper discusses results of a research which objective was to understand the contributions of digital educational technologies to the mathematical learning of students with ASD. Through the case study methodology, data were produced from weekly meetings with two ASD students that were in the initial phase of schooling. They were included in a regular classroom. This study shows evidence of contributions to the students' development in relation to the construction of mathematical concepts. In addition, it shows that the use of technological resources may represent a pedagogical alternative in the work with ASD students, since their involvement with computerized activities allowed for the construction of mathematical concepts that they previously could not do in a non-digital environment. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

For this purpose, we chose the book The Man Who Counted by Malba Tahan, delimiting its context in an aspect that goes beyond Mathematics: The relation between the woman and mathematics. The referential used to understand what woman means was the researcher Judith Butler, who understands that it is a produced category. According to the discourse analysis by Michel Foucault, we bring in the analysis elements in order to understand which gender relations are established from mathematics as a discourse throughout the work and how the woman becomes the woman in a discursive set. The results of this analysis explain ""self-practices"" in the woman category in the face of mathematics and suggests that Telassim (Tahan's woman character) represents, regardless of the historical or cultural context, many women who are silenced in front of the scientific field. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The sample consisted of twelve teenagers between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, students of Centro de Convívio dos Meninos do Mar - CCMar, in the Brazilian South Coast. The analysis pointed to the existence of three levels of understanding for the concept discussed above, as follows: First approximations or incipient ideas; notions of arithmetic mean based on concrete thought; arithmetic mean as a representative measure of a data set. From this investigation it is possible to indicate that the arithmetic mean concept requires the realization of reflective abstraction, there for, the symbolic elements of thought need to leave the material referents, because this is not a material concept, but a formal one. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Among the formative objectives we had, we emphasize that the purpose of this study is to understand how the learning of addition and subtraction operations occurred from the apprehension of the internal structure of the numbering system through teaching tasks developed with the fourteen students attending the ""Mathematics contents and teaching processes"" subject of the 4th period of Pedagogy at Goiás State University - Quirinópolis Campus. In search for answers as how this learning happened, a formative experiment was organized, named here as research methodological path. In this bias, the experiment sought to create situations to make the learning of these operations feasible. The research method chosen was the dialectical and historical materialism one. Concerning such choices, we have a structure of analysis composed of unity, episode, scenes, and flashes. The results give us indications that the undergraduates understood that the numbering systems have an internal logic that is valid for all the numerical bases composing them, and that, from this internal connection of the numbering system on, it is possible to carry out the addition and subtraction operations, as part of this internal system operationalization. We concluded that the undergraduates have appropriated the essential relation of the numbering systems, the formation of their orders, and the genesis of addition and subtraction operations. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

We emphasize that education and critical theory have already been studied in many works, including in mathematics education: For example, Adorno (2012), Pucci, Zuin and Ramos-de-Oliveira (2004) and Skovsmose (2015). Surrealism emerges as a vanguard movement built on artistic, intellectual, and political issues, which revolutionary ideas are against any totalizing imposition that implies thought formatting. Our approach, therefore, is an attempt to open the thought possibilities in mathematics, in the direction of the points listed by Miguel (2016) for a contemporary agenda of the Brazilian mathematical education. Rethinking the political role of mathematics and, consequently, mathematical education is urgent and there is nothing more significant than resorting to the Frankfurt School and surrealism, that is, to those who lived and wrote from totalitarian experiences. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In basic education, the subject is treated with superficiality and little conceptual deepening, basically by way of examples, while in the mathematics teacher initial formation, there is the prevalence of the formalist approach to irrational numbers, which does not enable the future teacher to teach the subject in basic education. Felix Klein had already pointed out the result of this break between undergraduate and basic education in mathematics over a century ago -there is a double discontinuity in teaching. In the case of irrational numbers, more specifically, this mismatch can provoke a vicious cycle: The teacher leaves the university without adequate formation to address the subject in Basic Education, causing the students to reach the university without an adequate image of the irrational number, and the cycle repeats itself. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

The aim of the present study was to identify, from the existing literature, relevant variables in the production of errors in mathematics. A systematic review of the literature of the period between 2012 and 2017 was independently performed by two researchers to evaluate the concordance between them. We searched the ERIC, PsycArticles, SciELO and Math Educ Database databases with the descriptors error AND mathematics OR math, error AND procedure AND mathematics OR math, error pattern AND mathematics OR math, analysis of errors AND mathematics OR math, systemic error AND mathematics OR math and their correspondents in Portuguese and Spanish. A total of 415 articles were identified, of which 31 were analyzed, dealing with error production. The variables identified as responsible for producing the most common errors refer to the student's internal causes or unspecified difficulties and errors in the teaching procedures. Responsibility for error is usually attributed to the students and the main trend of the research is only to inform the production of errors, since only a few studies have indicated ways to avoid or deal with errors produced by students in a specific and descriptive way.

This work shows and analyzes the ways the teaching of Statistics has taken, considering the bibliographical review by Garfield (1995), reestablished by Garfield and Ben-Zvi (2007), focusing on the specific case of the health area by our literature review. This last review included articles published from 2007 to 2017 in journals from health and teaching areas. The literature review analyzed 26 articles, which were classified into two categories: psychological aspects and teaching methodologies. The teaching of Statistics has evolved as an area of study and research. Individual and specific efforts have now received proper institutional guidelines for the teaching of Statistics. However, there are few instruments for evaluating what students learn. Yet, the use of theories of learning is minimal, what impacts on methodologies highly based only on the teachers’ practice. © 2019, Comite Latinoamericano de Matematica Educativa.

A teaching experiment that discussed two variational situations was designed for the treatment of the quadratic function. This paper only reports data of one these situations. The analysis of the empirical data involved an analytical approach that used Toulmin’s model of argumentation and two criteria to inform the classroom mathematical practices. Results correspond with two mathematical practices that supported a collective mathematical progress: 1) analyze and quantify what changes in a variational situation; and 2) generate and interpret representations of how the variable magnitudes change in a variational situation. Three connected elements were identified in the evolution of the mathematical practices: time, structure and mathematics. These elements enabled the establishment of a model of collective mathematical progress based on empirical evidence; this model documents a path students could follow to learn quadratic function. The proposed model has the quality of being explicative and the ability to adjust to interact with other students. © 2019 International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

We used written questionnaires which raised five algebraic problems and recorded audio interviews for collecting data. The results indicate that students use seven reflexive strategies (for example, they support on known facts and generate relationships, make backward work, among others) and an unreflective strategy, some of which have been identified in other researches.

In order to do so, we question the process of disciplining science that contributed to the deepening of various areas, at the same time as it propelled a growing dissociation among them. Similarly, the hyper-specialization of mathematical knowledge has contributed to the fragmentation of school mathematics in the arithmetic, geometry, and algebra ramifications, which has made it difficult to learn by the students. Seeking the balance between fragmentation and totalization, we investigated the intradisciplinarity of school mathematics with GeoGebra. We used a qualitative research methodology and we analyzed an activity of proportional reasoning exploration developed with mathematics teachers from an elementary school. The analysis indicate that GeoGebra allows for the exploration of multiple representations that highlight particularities of the mathematical fronts through its diverse resources and windows that present the dynamically connected mathematical objects, which contributes in a way that the disadvantages of each representation are satisfied by the advantages of the others in teaching and learning mathematics. We concluded that the intradisciplinary mathematical approach with GeoGebra emphasizes the concomitant work among the different mathematical ramifications and offers the teachers the possibility of exploring it in their pedagogical practice. © 2019 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

In this regard, we sought to determine how students of a public middle school (distance education program), located in a rural community in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, can develop mental calculation strategies when performing tasks involving addition and subtraction, in a shopping context. Eight different strategies were identified, some of which used fantasy money as a representation system that helped students to decompose quantities. They referred to strategies used by people, without schooling, when they receiving money back after paying for a purchase in the market.

Drawing on this premise, we describe in this article the process by which linear algebra was initially introduced as a teaching content, before gaining the academic course status, into the undergraduate programs in mathematics and engineering at the University of São Paulo (USP). Particularly relevant to this process was the role played by French mathematicians, especially members of the Bourbaki Group, who taught at USP during the 1945-1966 period. In the mathematics program of USP's School of Philosophy, Sciences, and Languages, linear algebra was a teaching content on the Geometry Complements course from the early 1950s up until 1964. Only in 1965 was a course entitled Linear Algebra introduced into the program's curriculum. In the São Paulo Polytechnic School's Engineering Programs, however, linear algebra had been taught since 1961 as a full-fledged course called Elements of Linear Algebra and Analytical Geometry, renaming the course previously called Elements of Analytical and Projective Geometry, in which linear algebra had constituted a teaching content since 1958. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Hence, in order to try to make a classic mathematical sentence clear to a generic reader, it is frequently ""translated"" into modern algebraic language. However, this kind of strategy may obscure some important characteristics and founding structures of Greek Mathematics. In the case of Euclid's Elements, in particular, to understand its conceptual basis, it is especially relevant to consider some fundamental theoretical issues faced by Euclid in his time. In the course of moving from ancient to modern mathematics, some important concepts, like those of number and measure, have changed. Furthermore, analytic reasoning has imposed itself over synthetic reasoning in a context where the role attributed to mathematics in the development process of general knowledge has significantly changed. In this article, we argue that ""translating"" mathematical sentences in Euclid's Elementsinto modern algebraic language may conceal differences and changes that were developed along thousands of years, inducing inaccurate interpretations of the classical mathematics foundations as well as of its relations with today's mathematics. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Throughout the development process, we noticed that the establishment of a space for collective discussions helped (re)-signify the knowledge to teach fractions. We believe that the development course has contributed to enlarge the teacher's reflection, guiding her to realize and work on her weaknesses, and to reinforce her strengths. The latter were enlarged by the investigative attitude about the diversity of methodological procedures that can be used in when teaching fractions. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

We report on a case study in which a chapter in a written textbook developed by a group of professors is analysed according to hermeneutics, describing the tessiture of the text and context of the implemented task. Aware that the task demanded processes different from those used when writing textbooks for face-to-face lecture courses, though at the same time not coinciding with the wordings of the interactions of a classroom lecture, the group of authors agreed on a notion of lessons on paper. Our analysis faces the challenge of problematising qualitative differences regarding the semiotic means of the mathematics embedded in face-to-face versus distance learning activities, raising questions on the nature of their results and the development of induced thinking in both contexts. Investigating the kind of mathematical knowledge produced for the lessons on paper texts, we drew on whether the written lesson for distance education is closer to the pedagogical-content knowledge than to the classical academic knowledge. © 2018, FIZ Karlsruhe.","Distance education; Hermeneutics; Interpretation methodology; Mathematical knowledge; Textbook development",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053186078

It is proposed that this notion is a useful tool in teachers' teaching practice and that it is necessary to prepare teachers in their capacity to formulate hypothetical learning trajectories about specific mathematics school topics. It is therefore also necessary to explore the learning processes that teachers undergo when learning this notion in their education. In this article, we introduce the notion of learning hypotheses as an adaptation of the idea of hypothetical learning trajectory (SIMON, 1995). We describe how the groups of secondary-school mathematics teachers that participated in a teacher education program understood and used this notion in order to determine the contribution of a set of tasks to a learning goal previously established. We found that the groups developed their knowledge of the notion of learning hypotheses and used it in a heterogeneous way, and that the education program was partly successful in its goal to make the groups of teachers learn and perceive the notion's utility. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

To proceed with the conceptualization, we researched for articles and books, followed by a screening and subsequent analysis and exploration of the concepts in the bibliographic study's perspective. Regarding the discussion of meanings, we chose a research as object of study to carry out the analysis, in the meta-analysis perspective, of aspects that illustrate how these concepts are associated with this relationship. The theoretical framework refers to authors who discuss affordance theory and theorizing about structuring, specifically agency. Data analysis shows that teachers knowledge, beliefs, and values influence information acquisition from curriculum materials, leading them to infer affordances, situate the agency in them and in the materials, and provoke the shift of power between the two agents. It also shows that affordances and agency can be collective skills provided by the exchange between teachers and their peers. © 2018 BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

This study has a theoretical contribution of Fleck's epistemology, considering that knowledge is produced collectively, so that researchers share a problem, theoretical framework and common practices form a collective of thought. The research that gives origin to this text is qualitative and quantitative, developed from the Social Network Analisys (SNA) methodology with the help of the Gephi software, which provided statistics for the analysis. Based on the Fleckian categories, the analysis allows us to infer that: the production of the knowledge available in the periodic is strongly linked to the postgraduate level; most of the articles come from institutions in the Southeast region; the co-authoring network that emerges has low density, which implies in little representativeness before the shared relations; the intellectual network is concentrated in three clusters: the Initial Education; Continuing Education, and Continuous Education and Professional Development, which presents intra and inter collective circulation of ideas that allow the arising of new categories, addressing more specific issues.","Bolema; Fleck; Intra and inter collective circulation of ideas; Mathematics teacher's training; Social network analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040465252

The sample comprised 94 students from 3rd, 5th, and 7th grades, along with their parents, from a private school in Campinas (São Paulo, Brazil). Data were obtained through surveillance in classrooms, questionnaires, and scales, and were subjected to univariate, multivariate, and structural equation models (path-analysis). The results indicated that attitudes towards mathematics became more negative as students advanced in school years. Likewise, younger students achieved better performance. Girls had a generally more positive attitude towards mathematics, but worse self-perception about their achievements, even when achieving superior performance in comparison to boys. Statistically significant interactions with positive correlations were found between parents' attitudes and expectancies towards their children's academic performance and these children's self-beliefs and attitudes towards mathematics. Students' personal resources seem to act as moderating variables, since self-concept and control beliefs appear to have strong effects not only on attitude towards mathematics, but also on academic performance in this subject. This work also emphasizes the importance of the educational institution in the construction of positive attitudes throughout the school years, by promoting positive personal experiences related to mathematics, in addition to working collectively with families to increase students' own sense of competence and self-confidence.","Achievement in mathematics; Attitude towards mathematics; Family; Path-analysis; Self-beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030789761

Francisca chose from a questionnaire in which she evidenced an adequate overall performance although not without errors. Two follow-up instruments were used in Francisca's case: questionnaire and interview; the latter and some of its dialogs were the fundamental support of this research. Our general research question was: how does the adult assign sense to decimal numbers in the resolution of problems with those numbers? Francisca signified such numbers through familiar situations of life and working experiences. In problem solving, she assigned decimal numbers establishing equivalence between those numbers and mainly natural numbers, while she linked secondly decimal numbers with fractions. When this young woman produced new problems, she favored the use of money and length measures represented by the decimal metric system. Some of Francisca's difficulties were referred to the interpretations of the decimal positions and decimal notations. Also, she made mistakes in reading, writing, or in operations linked to certain unstable positional notions.","Decimal point (decimal comma); Decimals; Problem solving; Sense; Signification",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030752248

The difficulties to carry out the research were related to the school supply conditions, such as inadequacy of the physical space, unavailability of computer lab, and the delay in the release of students. They undoubtedly hindered the development of the experiment, whose analysis shows that the organization of activities from a developmental perspective enables maturation and cognitive development of the student due to experiential experimentation, which enables the students to understand the nuclear aspect of the concept of volume of objects studied.

This is a qualitative research based on Piaget's theory -About the acquisition of knowledge and its relationship with affectivity - it analyzed how 21 students interacted in the application of three Webquest challenges. To collect the data, we used semi-structured questions: before, during and after the accomplishment of each challenge. The results showed that the interactions were mainly guided by cooperation. At the beginning of each challenge feelings such as interest, fear, and anxiety prevailed. As the students advanced in other challenges, sometimes being successful, sometimes making mistakes, the feelings aroused were joy, frustration, interest, fear, among others. We concluded that such feelings aroused the students' cognitive actions and even those who had not achieved a positive result persisted in the activities until the end, that is, nobody gave up and that happened due mainly to the instigating and interesting affective feature which Webquest encouraged within that context meant for learning mathematics.","Affectivity; The teaching of mathematics; Webquest",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030788349

Our working hypothesis is that the solely representation of the product of two natural numbers by the area of a rectangle can hinder the vision of the product of two integers. Referring us to the scheme of Mathematical Working Spaces, we need another representation for the semiotic genesis of the integers. We tested didactical resources coming out from a geometrical construction made by Descartes in his geometric supplement of the Discourse on the Method, but we observed that this geometric introduction of the product can also produce difficulties, because it does not easily illustrate the distributive law. We may explain this phenomenon considering the product of numbers as a procept. Thus, the homothetic transformations of the Cartesian plane constitute a convenient geometrical resource that we may propose for teaching of the integers and, more generally, the numbers with a sign.","2D geometry; Dilation; Distributive law; Mathematical working spaces; Multiplication of numbers; Semiotic genesis; Signs rule",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964456693

The data were obtained from the teacher and students (8 and 9-year-olds) of a forth-grade class from a Brazilian public elementary school. The main components of the data are the following: interviews, audio, and video recordings, a questionnaire and reports done by the teacher and students' records. Some of the identified potentialities are: encouragement to autonomy and creativity; development of students' argumentation and registering skills; search for different strategies mobilizing math knowledge. Limitations were also identified such as time to develop the tasks; break time between classes; children's lack of experience with argumentation and registering; unpredictability generated by the openness of the proposal. The potentialities raised point out to a possibility of using these tasks in the early grades, contributing not only to mathematics learning, but also to the development of competences such as respect and autonomy. The limitations observed were either overcome or minimized in many moments through the teacher's reflexive attitude and through team work.","Early Grades; Investigative Tasks; Mathematics Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953406437

The ethnographic text is presented as a discourse produced by the ethnographer with the task of making plausible the realities of different cultures. To practice ethnography with the Apyãwa people represented the possibility of realizing the cultural web being woven; of participating in a historical period of knowledge being produced, updated and taught as an intrinsic part of their cultural practice and to hear narratives that explain and justify this practice. Ultimately, it was the possibility to contemplate, in all this complexity, nuances of personality, the way they interact with each other and with the environment in which they live, that constitute the Apyãwa people and distinguishes them as a cultural group.","Cultural practices; Ethnomatematics; Ethos; Indigenous culture; World view",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953396523

This article discusses a process of negotiation of signs in Brazilian sign language, Libras, carried out with deaf students in the early years of a public elementary school. Among the different relevant aspects in this teaching activity within the classroom, the interaction concerning geometry as a central theme is highlighted. The first section of the article presents aspects related to deafness and to the education of deaf people. In the following are presented the contexts of activity as well as excerpts of conversations in which students make agreement on the signs for different geometric figures, which were absent in the dictionaries. The results indicate the importance of the negotiation process for the enlargement of the lexical field in Libras, as well as for the engagement of students in the activity, as this process offers an opportunity to explore mathematical properties. Finally, it is acknowledged that the inclusion of disabled students in the regular school seems to be well supported by legislation concerning the access, although more efforts are still needed in order to ensure learning spaces for everybody.","Brazilian Sign Language; Geometry; Inclusive Education; Mathematics Education and Deafness; Teaching and Learning of Mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953376723

First, we want to determine the most relevant forces that produced tensions in the discipline during the period considered. To do this, we propose an explanatory hypothesis on the overturning in the field of mathematical thinking that resulted when the functions were preferred instead of the elliptic integrals. This hypothesis is rooted in the state of “Analysis” and “Algebra” during the emergence time. Then we show that the constructions of Abel and Jacobi for the elliptic functions support our working hypothesis.

Our analysis is carried on an empirical produced by accompanying two Adult Education groups in their mathematic classes during three semesters. Those groups were attending the middle school for adults in a public school. This analysis highlights discourses from several ideological and pedagogical frames and motivations, sometimes in conflict. By identifying discursive formations in the adult mathematic classrooms and by putting in evidence their benchmarks and regulatory plots, this study aims at contributing for understanding those numeracy practices as pedagogical instances for inclusion and emancipation.","Discursive Practices; Education and Work; Ethnomathematics; Numeracy Practices; Youth and Adult Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920628350

Particularly, we intend to reveal how the construction of written narratives by an in-service teacher has constituted an important process in her professional development, when she proposed and implemented an investigative methodology to the teaching of Mathematics, in a challenging classroom of a public school. The results show that the teacher, exchanging experiences with peer researchers, inserted new reflections on her pedagogical practices (in and over the action). Those records for future trends with mathematics investigations enhanced her potentialities of new learning, through the perspective of the proposal of new didactical sequences that can be significant to the students, and feasible to real and complex classrooms we find nowadays in public schools. We consider that the use of narratives has provided her a kind of continued education that has taken into account broader cultural scholar questions, her teaching knowledge and previous experiences, overcoming classical conceptions of teacher education. © 2014, BOLEMA Departamento de Matematica.

Secondly, I describe and discuss, from my own practice, a lesson using dynamic tools for helping prospective teachers to understand the relationship between integration and differentiation within the context of the current literature from Mexico and abroad. While Mexico faces distinct issues within its educational system, challenges in how future mathematics teachers understand mathematical content appear universal. Thus, teaching mathematical content while modelling effective mathematical pedagogical practices is of relevance to all of us striving to enhance the quality of future mathematics teachers. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","dynamic software; education; fundamental theorem of calculus; GeoGebra; Mexico; research",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885958410

It has changed its objects, methods and sources. Despite the diversification of sources, some of them have still not been used systematically in research. This is the situation with regard to fiction texts. According to Lajolo (1997), literature is the radar and mirror of the values, emotions, feelings and point of view of societies. Therefore we can pose questions to literary texts to seek historical narratives. In this paper, parts of the literary texts Novelas Paulistanas and Memórias de um Sargento de Milícias have led us to historical research in secondary sources.

In the first phase of the project, the central organizing ideas of 14 numeration systems were specified. Each system belonged to a different Mesoamerican language. Three aspects of the systems were identified that would have to be accounted for in instructional design. They include using 20 as a multiplicative base.

In science education, research has shown that within these schools, science is taught as a body of simple facts and that inquiry-based teaching methods are practically absent, despite being endorsed by national and local curricula. We analyzed the case of ""Escuelas del Bicentenario"" (Bicentennial Schools), a School Improvement Program that has been held since 2007 in 151 primary schools in unprivileged areas of 6 provinces of Argentina. This professional development program is composed of a team of 30 science facilitators who work with about 1800 class teachers every fortnight in their own schools with the goal of improving their science instruction. We conducted an open survey to examine facilitators' perceptions of the efficacy of different professional development practices in having teachers incorporate inquiry-based science teaching methods in their classrooms. An overwhelming majority of science facilitators identified the same strategy as the most effective, namely modeling inquiry-based lessons in the actual classroom, with teachers very own students. We found the value of this practice, chosen by over 90% survey responders, to be related to the possibility of building teachers trust and understanding. First, when teachers see successful inquirybased lessons developed with their very own students, they begin to have trust not only in facilitators as skilled professionals, but also in the value of this teaching method as a way to develop student understanding and class participation. It also helps teachers trust their students learning capabilities. Second, it helps teachers to understand the nuances of implementing inquiry-based curriculum by themselves in the future, including how to handle student questions, a challenge that most facilitators reported as one of the biggest fear for teachers in adopting inquiry-based methods. © Common Ground, Melina Furman and María Eugenia Podestá.","Disadvantaged contexts; Inquiry based programs; Science education; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884374343

We also think that the results of international evaluations conducted in different countries are a good strategy to identify the different emphases of the various curriculums. Based on the results of the Program of International Student Assessment - PISA2003, a comparison was made between differences in math curriculum emphases in Brazil and Portugal. The methodology used for analysis was Differential Item Functioning (DIF). This methodology enables the identification of items that violate one of the key assumptions of Item Response Theory (IRT), whereby students from different groups, but the same cognitive skill, have the same probability of answering an item correctly. Analysis of 84 items of the mathematics test of the PISA 2003 showed that some items present DIF between Brazilian and Portuguese students.

On the other hand, the items of the sub-area ""change and relationships"" are apparently easier for students from Portugal. Items involving scientific contexts are easier for students in Portugal, as well, while involving contexts of personal life are easier for Brazilians. The results of this survey demonstrate the relevance and need of expanded debate on curriculum in education mathematics. Understanding the results of the tests of large-scale evaluations can provide new questions about how and what students learn about Mathematics.","Curriculum Learned; Differential Item Functioning; Education Mathematics; PISA2003",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863843119

Analysis is conducted of military plans or architectural designs of American forts in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in accordance with the teachings and rules found in the treaties of military engineering.

A qualitative research methodology was used, with interpretative analysis of the activities and the proposed instruments, which were organized in a Portfolio Book. The formulation and the application of the research, as well as the analysis of the results and the conclusions, were based on Vygotsky's historical-cultural approach and on other studies regarding mathematical language and the utilization of reading and writing in mathematics classes. The categories that emerged from the analysis of the data were the construction of mathematical knowledge, semantics of the mathematical terms, values and the potentiality of the activities. Considering all the categories, the results indicate that the process can make the relationship among teacher and students more interactive and effective for the construction of mathematical knowledge.","High School Mathematics; Historical-cultural Approach; Mathematics in Contexts; Portfolio Book; Reading and Writing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863809674

Next, I deal with the particularities of the concepts of the cuneiform mathematics, that is to say, its differences in relation to the mathematics of our time. Lastly, I treat aspects of the original languages of cuneiform texts that are still under discussion by the field. As a conclusion, I suggest that the results of this analysis are relevant not only to the translation process, but also to the reading of translations of mathematical cuneiform texts.","Akkadian; Cuneiform texts; Mathematics; Old babylonian period; Translation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portuguese",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958086679

It is argued that the consonance between the ontological and epistemological dimensions of ""what"" and ""how"" to investigate the subject of investigation confers a degree of confidence to the research findings. The search for that confidence transcends analyses based only on calculations and explanations of methodological procedures, regardless of how well founded they are.

It is focused on the constitution of mathematical idealities and of mathematics as a science under the perspective of the Husserlian phenomenological conception of reality and knowledge.

The discussion around the theme extended and resulted, in the late 1950's, in the development of a proposal for the internationalization of the mathematics teaching methodology, involving organizations such as UNESCO and OECE. The OECE developed recommendations for the implementation of modern mathematics (MM). These recommendations were disseminated and resignified in many different countries. Based on some of the OECE's recommendations, we seek to identify how they were operationalized in Brazil and Portugal. The question is: What did experiences with the MM and the publication of textbooks represent in these countries?

The characterization points at the existence of four different tendencies: a production that considers the studies about history of mathematics education as part of the research about history of mathematics; a trend of opinions that takes into account the pedagogical use of history in mathematics education and establishes conditions for the research in the history of mathematics education; studies that use oral history for mathematics teachers' training courses; and, finally, another trend that treats the history of mathematics education as history, that means, a specificity of historical production, having the mathematics education as an object.

The solution is approximate for narrow pads, and exact, in the asymptotic sense, when the width of the pad tends to zero; however, comparison with available numerical solution reveals that, even for a pad with width twice as large as its breadth, the present solution is perfectly adequate. © 1990 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946284308

This achieves an independent way of thinking in the students. MAT-100 is taken by all the students that enter the University. It is divided into 26 learning units that go from the Cartesian Plane and Functions to Differential Equations in Partial Derivatives. Every Learning Unit is divided into learning modules, each of which is subdivided into activities with their own learning objectives and exercises of auto-evaluation. The students are distributed in sections of approximately 50. Each section is attended by a professor and a student aid. In class the students work in groups where they do workshops and consult, studying the Units, solving exercises and resolving auto-evaluation tests. Lectures are given periodically on the most difficult topics. When the student feels prepared, he presents an exam which is given weekly. The exams are corrected by a computer DEC-10 with a system programmed in SIMULA. At the moment the course is being taken by 3439 students distributed in 56 sections, employing 29 professors and 103 students aids.
