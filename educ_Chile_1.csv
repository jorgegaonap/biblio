This method is presented together with evidence supporting its advantages. At a microscopic level, the simulator shows the mutual transformation of A molecules into B molecules and vice versa for the reversible one-step chemical reaction, A(g) double left right arrow B(g). The user defines the reaction as endothermic or exothermic and sets a given reaction temperature; SEQ-alfa (c) then calculates the kinetic constants of the forward and reverse reactions. Based on initial given concentrations, the animation then evaluates the respective rates and concentrations, as well as the concentration quotient value, as the reaction progresses towards its equilibrium state. SEQ-alfa (c) also demonstrates the effects of concentration and temperature alterations on the reaction's progress and the value of the reaction quotient until equilibrium is reached, thus giving the equilibrium constant. In addition, a validation of this new approach was carried out with 27 teachers. A pre-test and post-test of students' understanding of the basic concepts of chemical equilibrium were conducted. Tested groups attained a 50% average learning gain (n(exp) = 130, n(ctrl) = 26). Those students with little or no previous knowledge acquired a better understanding of chemical equilibrium. In addition, 80% of teachers agreed that the multimedia resource and its complementary activities had positive effects.";"[Ollino, Mario; Aldoney, Jenny; Dominguez, Ana M.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Merino, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;"Dominguez, AM (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.; Merino, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.";"mario.ollino@usm.cl; jenny.aldoney@usm.cl; anamaria.dominguez@usm.cl; cristian.merino@pucv.cl";Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019;"Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Aldoney, Jenny/0000-0003-3095-5433";"Office of General Teaching at the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (DGD); Teaching and Learning Office (DEA) as part of the Olivier Espinoza Aldunate [UTFSM-OEA/2015]; Fondecyt from the Chilean Government's National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [1150659]";"The researchers gratefully acknowledge financial support from The Office of General Teaching at the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (DGD) and the Teaching and Learning Office (DEA) as part of the Olivier Espinoza Aldunate (UTFSM-OEA/2015) Education Research Project; and from Fondecyt Project 1150659 from the Chilean Government's National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT).";;26;4;4;3;24;ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY;CAMBRIDGE;THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND;1109-4028;;;CHEM EDUC RES PRACT;Chem.

This tool was applied to analyze the presentation of the concept of osmosis in 16 chemistry and biology books at different educational levels. The results showed that more than 50% of the books present the process of osmosis connected just with concentration properties associated with the hydrodynamic state of the osmotic process, forgetting the properties of osmotic pressure to define the state of osmotic equilibrium. This omission creates confusion between the state of osmotic equilibrium with the isotonic state by reducing the entire osmosis process to a mere process of diffusion by differences in concentrations. Moreover, in 4 of the biology textbooks, the presentation of the osmosis concept and osmotic equilibrium in cell system illustrations generates confusion between hydrostatic pressure generated by gravity vs. hydrostatic pressure generated by membrane tension or turgor pressure. Our results show that in most of the texts, the osmotic process is not connected with the non-equilibrium state, macroscopic dynamic state or equilibrium state, whereas in other textbooks, equivalence between these states and hypo-hyper and isotonic states is incorrectly presented.;"[Spinelli Barria, Michele; Morales, Cecilia; Merino, Cristian; Quiroz, Waldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile";;Quiroz, W (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile.;waldo.quiroz@pucv.cl;"Merino, Cristian/D-1651-2016; Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019";"Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581";"VRIEA of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [DREAMS 0.37.307/2015]; Magister en Didactica de las Ciencias Experimentales'' of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; CONICYTPCHA/Magister Nacional [2015-22151311]";This scientific product is derived from FONDECYT research 1150659 CONICYT - CHILE and the VRIEA of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (project DREAMS 0.37.307/2015).

The model is research based as it considered a literature review for adequate selection and design of activities consistent with the levels of students' reasoning skills. The level of scientific reasoning is positively correlated to student success. By contrast to a control group of students following traditional lectures, we observed a significant reduction in failure rate for students that do not yet possess formal scientific reasoning. This profile of students being the majority, we conclude that implementing active learning is particularly suited to the first year of higher education in the context of a developing country. It fits the particularities of student profile and typical classroom size, leading to learning improvement and reduction of academic risk, as well as being financially sound.;"[Lagubeau, Guillaume; Tecpan, Silvia; Hernandez, Carla] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile";;Lagubeau, G (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile.;"guillaume.lagubeau@usach.cl; silvia.tecpan@usach.cl; carla.hernandez.s@usach.cl";Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/I-9567-2018;"Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/0000-0001-9343-6863; Hernandez-Silva, Carla/0000-0003-2974-4989";"CONICYT through Proyecto Fondecyt de Iniciacion [11170580]; Proyecto DICYT USACH [031931TF]";We thank Vicerrectoria Academica USACH through Convenio Marco CM USA1856, and the Engineering Faculty of USACH.

J;"Quiroz, W; Rubilar, CM";;;;"Quiroz, Waldo; Merino Rubilar, Cristian";;;Natural laws and ontological reflections: the textual and didactic implications of the presentation of Boyle's law in general chemistry;CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE;;;English;Article;;;;;;;SCIENCE;"This study develops a tool to identify errors in the presentation of natural laws based on the epistemology and ontology of the Scientific Realism of Mario Bunge. The tool is able to identify errors of different types: (1) epistemological, in which the law is incorrectly presented as data correlation instead of as a pattern of causality; (2) semantic, in which natural law is presented as a mathematical statement that relates variables but with an absence of ambiguous material reference; (3) deterministic, in which the relationship of natural variables is presented but with no causality statement; and (4) mechanistic, in which a causality statement is presented with the absence of an explanatory mechanism. In this work, Boyle's law was used as an example of the applicability of the instrument. In this case, we found errors in most of the university textbooks that we analyzed. Most of the errors arose from the disconnection between the symbolic and microscopic levels. The presentations of Boyle's law in general chemistry are given in textbooks that include illustrations based in a macroscopic perspective, in which the macroscopic compression mechanism is completely disconnected from the microscopic collision mechanism. This disconnection results in the incorrect presentation of gas pressure as the cause and gas volume as the effect.";"[Quiroz, Waldo; Merino Rubilar, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile";;Quiroz, W (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile.;waldo.quiroz@ucv.cl;"Merino, Cristian/D-1651-2016; Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019";"Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581";CONICYT - CHILEComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT);Scientific product derived from FONDECYT research 1150659.

It was developed to determine whether individual residents are meeting minimal knowledge standards at the end of their training programs. Methods: We performed a retrospective evaluation of the EMNOT for all years it has been administered (2009-2015). The test was analyzed for content, taxonomy of questions asked (1: direct recall; 2: diagnosis; 3: evaluation/decision-making), residents' performance, difficulty index and discrimination index. Results: During the years of EMNOT administration, the most frequently tested areas have been pediatric orthopaedics (22.9 %), spine (13.8 %), general orthopaedics (13.8 %) and musculoskeletal trauma (9.9 %). A significant increase in questions with images was observed, as well as a significant decrease in the percentage of Type 1 and an increase in Type 3 questions. The Difficulty Index showed a medium level of difficulty for all years the examination has been administered. The Discrimination Index showed good discrimination in 2009, fair discrimination from 2010 through 2012, and excellent discrimination from 2013 through 2015. Conclusion: The EMNOT has evolved over several years to include better quality questions, better discrimination, and a more representative distribution of questions covering the different orthopaedic sub-specialties.

The ontological analysis shows that the concepts heat q'' and work w'' are categorized as processes, while the concepts of internal energy U'', pressure P'', volume V'' and temperature T'' are categorized as properties. The results reveal that 8 of the 15 textbooks incorrectly present work w'' as a property, while 7 textbooks incorrectly present heat q'' as a property. Furthermore, 3 textbooks present the concept of energy as a property and assign it a merely operational definition as the capacity to do work. The analysis also examined patterns of causality and the mechanism used to explain the connection between the variables of cause and effect in three thermodynamic systems. The results indicated that only 2 textbooks contain such a mechanism.;"[Castillo Poblete, Joaquin; Ogaz Rojas, Rocio; Merino, Cristian; Quiroz, Waldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile";;Quiroz, W (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;waldo.quiroz@pucv.cl;"Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019; Merino, Cristian/D-1651-2016";"Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581";"CONICYT - CHILEComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT);  [DREAMS 0.37.307/2015]";This scientific product is derived from FONDECYT research 1150659.

Limited evidence exists regarding their effectiveness in improving academic performance among medical students. This study aims to assess whether a smartphone application could improve academic performance in multiple-choice tests. Methods: A double-masked randomised trial was held among interns at the School of Medicine of the Universidad de Valparaiso. Participants were randomised to receive an application designed to review key concepts in Internal Medicine and its subspecialties using clinical vignettes. Contents were selected and provided in a format akin to a mandatory national examination required for practising medicine in Chile. Analyses were undertaken under the intention to treat principle and missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques. Results: Eighty interns volunteered to participate in this trial, most were female (48 students, 60%) and had a mean age of 25.3 +/- 2.2 years. Participants showed significant experience with smartphones, with a median use of 4 years (IQR 3-6 years) and 67 (83.7%) reporting routine use in clinical practice. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements in performance amongst students allocated to the smartphone application (mean increase of 14.5 +/- 8.9 vs 9.4 +/- 11.6points, p = 0.03). A reduction in total time and mean time per question was also found, which was significant in complete-case analyses (p = 0.04). Discussion: Smartphones were popular among medical trainees. Academic performance was significantly improved by the use of our application, although the overall effect was smaller than expected from previous trials. This study provides evidence that smartphone-based interventions can assist in teaching internal medicine.;"[Martinez, Felipe] Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile; [Martinez, Felipe] Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Tobar, Catalina] Hosp Gustavo Fricke, Dept Med Interna, Alvares 1532, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Taramasco, Carla] Univ Valparaiso, Lab Informac & Tecnol, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso 222, Chile";;"Martinez, F (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile.; Martinez, F (corresponding author), Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile.";felipe.martinez@uv.cl;Martinez, Felipe/ABF-5868-2021;Martinez, Felipe/0000-0002-9857-8403;;;;17;9;9;0;17;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1472-6920;;BMC MED EDUC;BMC Med.

The purpose of this study was to to describe family medicine graduates' perceived experience with intimidation, harassment and discrimination (IHD) during residency training.MethodsA mixed-methods study was conducted on a cohort of family medicine graduates who completed residency training during 2006-2011. Phase 1, the quantitative component, consisted of a retrospective survey of 651 graduates. Phase 2, the qualitative component, was comprised of 11 qualitative interviews. Both the survey and the interviews addressed graduates' experience with IHD with respect to frequency and type, setting, perpetrator, perceived basis for IHD, and the effect of the IHD.ResultsThe response rate to the survey was 47.2%, with 44.7% of respondents indicating that they experienced some form of mistreatment/IHD during residency training, and 69.9% noting that it occurred more than once. The primary sources of IHD were specialist physicians (75.7%), hospital nurses (47.8%), and family physicians (33.8%). Inappropriate verbal comments were the most frequent type of IHD (86.8%). Graduates perceived the basis of the IHD to be abuse of power (69.1%), personality conflict (36.8%), and family medicine as a career choice (30.1%), which interview participants also described. A significantly greater proportion IMGs than CMGs perceived the basis of IHD to be culture/ethnicity (47.2% vs 10.5%, respectively). The vast majority (77.3%) of graduates reported that the IHD experience had a negative effect on them, consisting of decreased self-esteem and confidence, increased anxiety, and sleep problems. As trainees, they felt angry, threatened, demoralized, discouraged, manipulated, and powerless. Some developed depression or burnout, took medication, or underwent counselling.ConclusionsIHD continued to be prevalent during family medicine residency training, with it occurring most frequently in the hospital setting and specialty rotations. Educational institutions must work with hospital administrators to address issues of mistreatment in the workplace. Residency training programs and the medical establishment need to be cognizant that the effects of IHD are far-reaching and must continuously work to eradicate it.";"[Szafran, Olga] Univ Alberta, Dept Family Med, 6-10 Univ Terrace, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada; [Woloschuk, Wayne] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Room 701B,3330 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Torti, Jacqueline M.

In particular, our study participants were asked to explain why a mixture of water and alcohol works as an antifreeze. Data collected in the form of written explanations were analysed using a mechanistic reasoning framework based on the characterisation of system components (e.g., entities, properties, activities, organisation) and paying attention to the causal models invoked by the participants in their explanations. Our analysis revealed that students at the same educational level construct a wide range of explanations for the same phenomenon that are indicative of different reasoning modes going from descriptive to relational to simple causal to emerging mechanistic. Although the explanations generated by students in our sample were not very sophisticated in terms of the causal models on which they relied, some participants were capable of generating mechanistic explanations using particulate models of matter. The framework for analysis introduced in this contribution can be of use to teachers and researchers in the characterisation of student reasoning.;"[Moreira, Patricia; Marzabal, Ainoa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Talanquer, Vicente] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA";;Moreira, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;pmmoreira@uc.cl;"; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017";"Talanquer, Vicente/0000-0002-5737-3313; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889";"FONDECYT in ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160148];  [CONICYT-21161280]";This work was supported by CONICYT-21161280, which provided a scholarship for the first author of this paper, and by the research project FONDECYT 1160148 in Chile.;;47;12;12;3;17;ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY;CAMBRIDGE;THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND;1109-4028;1756-1108;;CHEM EDUC RES PRACT;Chem.

Yet we lack a complete understanding of how different instructional strategies impact the relationship between cooperation and learning. In this paper we present results from a field experiment with 82 first-year students in an introductory physics course showing how different instructional strategies led to different social configurations in the classroom and to differences in individual academic performance. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively sought out information from multiple peers were less likely to perform well on well-structured problems as compared to those who did not seek help, whereas, for ill-structured (real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the learning environment. We observed that good performance on ill- and well-structured problems was sensitive to different social network configurations. In a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students performed better on well-structured problems than ill-structured problems. By contrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access to more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems promoted creative thinking, provided that instructors guided the problem-solving process and motivated students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems entailed. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional strategies play an important role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing cooperative learning methods have to accompany them with adequate instructional strategy.";"[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Northwestern Inst Complex Syst NICO, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Ctr Invest Complejidad Social CICS, Las Condes 7550000, Chile; [Leonardi, Paul M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coll Engn, Technol & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";;Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.;"jpulgar@ubiobio.cl; cristian.candia@kellogg.northwestern.edu";;"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Candia Vallejos, Cristian/0000-0002-9654-543X";AAPT E.

In this qualitative research study, we analysed changes in the reasoning expressed by 10th grade students in a Chilean school in their written explanations about freezing point depression before and after a lesson on the topic. We also investigated how the teacher's interventions shaped the type of reasoning expressed by participating students. Our findings revealed significant shifts in the types of explanations generated after the lesson. A significant number of students transitioned from relational to simple causal reasoning in their pre- and post-lesson explanations. After the lesson most of the explanations were based on the activities of one or more of the system's entities. Analysis of teacher-student interactions during the observed lesson suggests that the teacher's mediation played a central role in the shift towards simple causal reasoning with centralized causality that was observed. The teacher in our study was more skilled at eliciting students' ideas than at helping students develop them with proper scaffolding. Thus, the observed classroom talk could not be considered as accountable talk, as most of the key ideas were introduced, selected, or reshaped by the teacher.;"[Moreira, Patricia; Marzabal, Ainoa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Talanquer, Vicente] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA";;Moreira, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"pmmoreira@uc.cl; vicente@u.arizona.edu";"; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017";"Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Talanquer, Vicente/0000-0002-5737-3313";"CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECA DOCTORADO NACIONAL [2016 - 21161280]; FONDECYT in ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160148]";This work was funded by the CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECA DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2016 - 21161280 and by the research project FONDECYT 1160148 in Chile.;;46;3;3;1;17;ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY;CAMBRIDGE;THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND;1109-4028;1756-1108;;CHEM EDUC RES PRACT;Chem.

However, due to their constrained nature, these problems hinder collaboration and idea generation. In order to encourage student collaboration and decision making demands among undergraduate students in an introductory physics course, we utilized a real-world problem where groups were asked to compose a well-structured physics problem for younger learners. In this study we explored how they collaborated in composing physics problems. Data collection consisted of audio recording of the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their physics problems and their respective problem solutions. Through interviews, we accessed participants' perceptions of the task and related challenges. Results suggest that composing problems is an opportunity for participants to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details, and magnitudes and units to introduce in their activities. Further, participants valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced by them with traditional well-structured problems. These findings shed light on the nature of composing physics problems in undergraduate courses, where participants assume a different role by facing a real-world activity that encourages expertise through physics-related communication and writing.;"[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Fahler, Valentina; Spina, Alexis] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Gevirtz Grad Sch Educ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA";;Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.;jpulgar@ubiobio.cl;;"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Fahler, Valentina/0000-0002-9883-9052; Spina, Alexis/0000-0002-9219-7888";AAPT E.

Based on the frameworks introduced by telepresence and media richness theories, and following a constructivist-based learning approach, we argue that the greater the similarity of an online museum experience is to its physical counterpart, the more positive will be the observer's perception of the collection. We reason that the similarity would lead online visitors to develop greater cognitive involvement which in turn will produce more positive attitudes toward the collection. In support of this argument, we present the results of a comparative study in which 565 participants were exposed randomly to four different exhibitions: two-dimensional collections of art and aircraft museums and three-dimensional tours of similar museums. Results indicate that whereas 3D tours have a strong effect on users' intentions to visit the real museum, cognitive involvement and sense of presence mediate the association between these variables. In terms of managerial implications, our study shows that if educational professionals want to stimulate their students to visit museums, 3D tours appear to be more effective for engaging learners through a realistic-looking environment. By offering richer perceptual cues and multimodal feedback (e.g., users can view 3D objects from multiple viewpoints or zoom in/out the objects), the study suggests that participants may increase their reasoning process and become more interested in cultural content.;"[Katz, James E.] Boston Univ, Div Emerging Media Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Halpern, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Halpern, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;"Katz2020@bu.edu; dmhalper@uc.cl";;;;;;41;12;14;7;83;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1059-0145;1573-1839;;J SCI EDUC TECHNOL;J.

The study consisted of two phases starting with designing a computational chemistry based learning environment followed by a case study where students' perceptions towards educational computational chemistry were explored. First, we designed an authentic research-based chemistry learning module that supported problem-based learning through the utilisation of computational chemistry methods suitable for pre-service chemistry education. The objective of the learning module was to promote learning of specific chemistry knowledge and development of scientific skills. Systematic design decisions were made through the TPASK framework. The learning module was designed for a third-year physical chemistry course taken by pre-service chemistry teachers in Chile. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in a course, and students' perceptions were gathered using semi-structured group interviews. The sample consisted of 22 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis using the same TPASK framework employed in the learning module design. Based on our findings, pre-service chemistry teachers first acquired Technological Scientific Knowledge (TSK) and then developed some elements of their TPASK. Besides, they highly appreciated the combination of student-centred problem-based learning and the use of computational chemistry tools. Students felt the educational computational learning environment supported their own knowledge acquisition and expressed an interest in applying similar learning environments in their future teaching careers. This case study demonstrates that learning through authentic real-world problems using educational computational methods offers great potential in supporting pre-service teachers' instruction in the science of chemistry and pedagogy. For further research in the TPASK framework, we propose there would be significant benefit from developing new learning environments of this nature and evaluating their utility in pre-service and in-service chemistry teacher's education.;"[Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Bahamonde Padilla, Victor] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile; [Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Druker, Sofia] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Diaz, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Dept Educ Diferencial, Santiago, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, AI Virtasen Aukio 1,POB 55, Helsinki 00014, Finland";;"Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile.; Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile.";jorge.rodriguez@umce.cl;"BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017; Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021";"BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X; Druker, Sofia/0000-0002-0934-4825";"DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [FGI 46-18]; Doctorate in Education Program - UMCE, Chile [PIPedI20164]; Programa Extraordinario de Becas de Postgrado - Doctorado en Educacion - UMCE";This research was supported by the FGI 46-18 project (DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile).

In this pilot study, we investigate the relationship between dyad training on stress, anxiety, cognitive load, and performance in a simulated bradycardia scenario.MethodsForty-one fourth-year medical school trainees were randomized as dyads (n=24) or individuals (n=17) for an education session on day 1. Reassessment occurred on day 4 and was completed as individuals for all trainees. Primary outcomes were cognitive load (Paas scale), stress (Cognitive Appraisal Ratio), and anxiety levels (abbreviated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes were time-based performance metrics.ResultsOn day 1 we observed significant differences for change in anxiety and stress measured before and after the training scenario between groups. Individuals compared to dyads had larger mean increases in anxiety, (19.6 versus 7.6 on 80-point scale, p=0.02) and stress ratio (1.8 versus 0.9, p=0.045). On the day 4 post-intervention assessment, no significant differences were observed between groups. Secondary outcomes were significant for shorter time to diagnosis of bradycardia (p=0.01) and time to initiation of pacing (p=0.04) in the dyad group on day 1. On day 4, only time to recognizing the indication for pacing was significantly shorter for individual training (hazard ratio [HR]=2.26, p=0.02).ConclusionsDyad training results in lower stress and anxiety levels with similar performance compared to individual training.;"[Abbott, Eduardo F.; Laack, Torrey A.] Mayo Clin, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Internal Med, Escuela Med, Diagonal Paraguay 362,5th Floor, Santiago 8330077, Chile; [Laack, Torrey A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Licatino, Lauren K.; Warner, Paul A.; Torsher, Laurence C.] Dept Anesthesia & Perioperat Med, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Wood-Wentz, Christina M.] Mayo Clin, Div Clin Trials & Biostat, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Newman, James S.; Rieck, Katie M.] Mayo Clin, Div Hosp Internal Med, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA";;"Laack, TA (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.; Laack, TA (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.";Laack.Torrey@mayo.edu;;;Mayo Clinic Simulation Center - Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine;This work was supported by internal funds from the Mayo Clinic Simulation Center.

The present study aimed to adapt and validate a shortened version of Bauer's Attitude toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory version 2 (ASCIv2) for use in a Latin American context. It also explored attitudes towards chemistry of Chilean secondary school students, and assessed the effect of school type, year group, gender, and chemistry achievement on both cognitive and affective dimensions. The participants were 523 secondary school students from public, private subsidised, and private schools in Chile. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were first carried out to validate ASCIv2. The results of CFA showed that ASCIv2 retained the two-factor structure and showed optimal model fit, but three items had to be removed from the original instrument. The research also showed that attitudes towards science were neither positive nor negative, a reality similar to that of other countries. The results of multivariate and univariate analyses of variance showed significant effects of year group and chemistry achievement on attitudes towards chemistry. No effects of school type, gender or interactions between factors were found. Follow-up analyses revealed that as students advance through school their attitudes decline, but that the higher their chemistry marks, the more positive their attitudes become. These findings are partially in line with previous data from other countries and are a starting point for more research into attitudes towards chemistry in Latin America.;"[Montes, L.

J;Bruna, C;;;;Bruna, Carola;;;Motivating active learning of biochemistry through artistic representation of scientific concepts;JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"biochemistry; art; learning; motivation";LECTURE;First-year students often feel discouraged, especially with courses that require complex thinking and involve establishing relations between different subjects such as biochemistry. It has been proposed that student-centred pedagogy can achieve motivation and improve learning. In this context, this case study reports the use of art as a strategy to engage students in studying and learning biochemistry. Three Art & Biochemistry sessions were included in the programme of the Biochemistry course of first-year veterinary medicine students as one of the graded activities. Working as a team, students expressed a biochemical concept or process of their choice through any art representation to their classmates and to a panel of professors, both of which evaluated their performance using a global perspective rubric. The students' assessment of the activity over three consecutive years suggests that the Art & Biochemistry sessions were successful as an approach to motivate them, and were also perceived as helpful to the understanding and learning of biochemistry. This report supports a positive relationship between art and science in enhancing self-learning and could be easily applied to other subjects and disciplines.;[Bruna, Carola] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Concepcion, Chile;;Bruna, C (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Biol, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.;carolabruna@udec.cl;;Bruna, Carola/0000-0003-0554-7147;;;;15;2;2;0;24;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0021-9266;2157-6009;;J BIOL EDUC;J.

The initial differences identified in the development of written language precursors are directly related to subsequent students' academic trajectories. Socioeconomic status is a significant source of initial differences in performance, with discrepancies in the development of reading precursors favoring children from more affluent backgrounds. We assessed reading precursors in 176 Chilean children from different socioeconomic levels. Significant differences in performance were found, which tended to favor the higher socioeconomic groups for each precursor we tested. However, the developmental trajectories of skills were similar for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and oral comprehension. A compensatory trajectory was observed only in the case of rapid naming. The problem arises from the need for educational systems to adapt to the specific needs of their students, in order to generate compensatory trajectories in all reading precursor skills and enable a decrease in the gaps in reading performance among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.;"[Espinoza, Victoria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Victoria; Santa Cruz, Catalina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Ctr Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Rosas, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Espinoza, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Vicua Mackenna 4860, Chile.;victoriaespinoza@uc.cl;;Santa Cruz, Catalina/0000-0002-1074-6207;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [ANID PIA CIE160007];The present research was financially supported by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo ANID PIA CIE160007.;;77;0;0;4;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1057-3569;1521-0693;;READ WRIT Q;Read.

The students' abilities to recognize the three representations of the electric field and do conversions gave insight into their understanding of this concept. We used the theory of registers of semiotic representations as a framework to analyze the data. Our results showed that the direction of the conversion is an essential factor in determining the students' success in performing conversions of electrical field representations. We found close synergy between the vector field plot and the algebraic notation of the electric field. However, we found that the conversions that involve electric field lines do not present synergy. The electric field lines representation is especially difficult for students, both as a source and as a target representation, specifically, the interpretation and representation of the magnitude of the field through the density of field lines. We recommend that teachers and researchers of electricity and magnetism be more conscious of the difficulties that some conversion tasks may present to their students. We specifically invite instructors to he attentive to how they approach the representation of electric field lines and be explicit when performing conversions that involve electric field lines.;"[Campos, Esmeralda; Zavala, Genaro] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, E Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Zavala, Genaro] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 810, Santiago 7500971, Chile; [Zuza, Kristina; Guisasola, Jenaro] Univ Basque Country, Donostia Phys Educ Res Grp, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Zuza, Kristina; Guisasola, Jenaro] Sch Engn Gipuzkoa UPV EHU, Appl Phys Dept, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain";;"Zavala, G (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, E Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico.; Zavala, G (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 810, Santiago 7500971, Chile.";genaro.zavala@tec.mx;"Zavala, Genaro/P-7190-2016; Guisasola, Jenaro/L-9040-2014; Zuza, Kristina/K-7973-2014";"Zavala, Genaro/0000-0001-5880-1124; Guisasola, Jenaro/0000-0002-0817-3905; Zuza, Kristina/0000-0002-4455-0165";"School of Engineering and Sciences of Tecnologico de Monterrey; Basque GovernmentBasque Government [PIBA IT1349-19]; Spanish Government MINECOSpanish Government [EDU2015-65359-P]; Writing Lab, TecLabs, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico";We thank Dr. J.

This study was based on responses obtained in hundreds of written exams complemented with several oral interviews, which were held with first-year engineering and science university students. Their responses allowed us to identify a series of misconceptions unreported in the literature so far.

The most significant changes are (i) the addition and removal of items to achieve parallelism in the objectives (dimensions) of the test, thus allowing comparisons of students' performance that were not possible with the original version, and (ii) changes to the distractors of some of the original items that represent the most frequent alternative conceptions. The final modified version (after an iterative process involving four administrations of test variations over two years) was administered to 471 students of an introductory university physics course at a large private university in Mexico. When analyzing the final modified version of the test it was found that the added items satisfied the statistical tests of difficulty, discriminatory power, and reliability; also, that the great majority of the modified distractors were effective in terms of their frequency selection and discriminatory power; and, that the final modified version of the test satisfied the reliability and discriminatory power criteria as well as the original test.

Simulations that mirror the complex realities of clinical practice have the potential to induce a range of emotions, without a clear understanding of their impact on learning and the learner. Students' emotional states have important effects on their learning process that can be either positive or negative, and are often difficult to predict. We aimed to determine: (1) To what extent achievement emotions are experienced by medical students during a complex simulation based learning activity, i.e. a ward round simulation (WRS). (2) What their performance scores are and too which extent performance scores do correlate with emotions and 3) how these emotions are perceived to impact learning. Methods A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Using an Achievement Emotion Questionnaire, we explored undergraduate medical student's emotions as they participated in a complex ward round-based simulation. Their performance was rated using an observational ward round assessment tool and correlated with emotions scores. Six focus groups were conducted to provide a deeper understanding of their emotional and learning experiences. Results Students experienced a range of emotions during the simulation, they felt proud, enjoyed the simulation and performed well. Students felt proud because they could show in the complex simulation what they had learned so far. Students reported moderate levels of anxiety and low levels of frustration and shame. We found non-significant correlations between achievement emotions and performance during ward round simulation. Conclusions Placing undergraduate students in high complex simulations that they can handle raises positive academic achievement emotions which seem to support students' learning and motivation.;"[Behrens, Claudia C.] Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; [Dolmans, Diana H.; Driessen, Erik W.] Maastricht Univ, Sch Hlth Profess Educ, Univ Singel 60, NL-6229 ER Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gormley, Gerard J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Educ, Univ Rd, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland";;Behrens, CC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.;cbehrens@ucn.cl;;Behrens, Claudia/0000-0001-9859-7295;;;;29;2;4;3;8;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1472-6920;;BMC MED EDUC;BMC Med.

Medical education has slowly adjusted to these reforms, although the region is still at risk to have a chronic shortage of family doctors. This paper presents the evaluation of a new post-graduate family medicine program in Tajikistan, focused on competency-based training. The findings are relevant for policy makers, international organizations and practitioners participating in similar medical education reform programs. Methods We employed a quasi-experimental control group design and compared intervention residents, control group residents with traditional training, and 1st year residents with no training in two outcomes, clinical knowledge and competencies. We employed two objective measures, a written multiple-choice question test (MCQT) and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), respectively. We report reliability and validity of the measures along with ANOVA, planned contrasts and effect size estimates to examine differences across groups. Results We found statistically significant differences in both clinical knowledge and competencies between intervention and control groups. We also detected a large intervention effect size. Participants in the intervention outperformed control group participants in the two measures. Our analysis suggests that intervention and control group participants are comparable in terms of initial knowledge and competencies, strengthening the argument that the intervention caused the improvement in the program outcomes. Discussion Receiving tailored training and structured opportunities to practice knowledge and competencies in clinical settings have a positive effect on the education of family medicine doctors in Tajikistan. Our results support curriculum reform and investment in medical education in the form of longer and supervised on-the-job preparation designed to be more in line with international standards. We discuss suggestions for future studies and potential requirements to inform replicability in other countries. Conclusion Family medicine is well recognized as central to health systems throughout the world, but high quality residency training lags behind in some countries. Our study showed that investing in family medicine residency programs and structured training is effective in increasing critical clinical competencies. We encourage promoting comprehensive post graduate family medicine doctor training so that the goals of a family medicine centered health system are attainable.;"[Bohle, Leah F.; Yarbaeva, Shakhlo N.; Prytherch, Helen] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland; [Bohle, Leah F.; Prytherch, Helen] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ross, Greta] Independent Hlth Consultant, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ross, Greta; Dzhabarovna, Davlyatova Dilbar; Yarbaeva, Shakhlo N.; Kasymova, Zukhra A.] Med Educ Reform Project Tajikistan, Dushanbe, Tajikistan; [Dzhabarovna, Davlyatova Dilbar] Inst Postgrad Educ Healthcare Republ Tajikist, Dept Family Med, Dushanbe, Tajikistan";;"Bohle, LF (corresponding author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland.; Bohle, LF (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.";leah.bohle@swisstph.ch;Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019;Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272;Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation;The study was conducted within the Medical Education Project of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Tajikistan.

Socio-constructivism provides a solid base to explain how teamwork can foster innovation through the use of cultural artifacts, such as boundary objects. The purpose of this paper describing the anatomy of negotiation within several teams of engineering students located in universities of Northern California and Santiago de Chile from 2010 to 2017. We propose the concept of conflict orchestration to explain the dynamics of engineering teams working on innovation-driven engineering design challenges. A context sensitive qualitative research design was deployed using an ethnographic approach to the study team negotiation patterns observed in 11 teams of engineering students from Northern California and Santiago de Chile. The methodological focus was on identifying commonalities in the use of boundary objects and trading zones emerging from the students' team interaction. Our findings illustrate two distinct strategies that the engineering teams adopted using boundary objects. We describe the use of Sticky Notes and Third Platforms. Finally, we explore students' perceptions of the educational gain of PBL engineering design courses. The relevance of this study is threefold. First it conceptualizes a teamwork phenomenon that energizes innovation through scaffolded conflict. We also explore how this concept is enacted by engineering teams in two different cultural sites.

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to characterise the nature of the change in student thinking about evolution through the mechanism of natural selection during a six-lesson intervention with a group of ninth-grade students (14-15 years old) from a private subsidised school in Chile. The study group included thirteen students to whom a pre- and post-test was applied using the questionnaire Assessment of Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORNS), and from whom short tasks were collected at the end of three lessons. The data were analysed using a quantitative and qualitative analysis of nine students grouped in five cases of study. The main patterns described here are the recurrence of the design teleology thinking in students, the initial use of key concepts such as mutation, survival, and differential reproduction during the trajectories, the abundance of mixed thinking during and at the end of the instruction, and the low coherence in the structure of thinking, both in time and through the different contexts analysed.;"[Parraguez, Carolina; Nunez, Paola; Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Kruger, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany";;Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile.;hernan.cofre@pucv.cl;;;"International Cooperation program for attraction of advanced human capital, [Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica] [MEC 80180066]; Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development [FONDECYT]Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181801]";This study was supported by the International Cooperation program for attraction of advanced human capital, [Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica MEC 80180066] and by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development [FONDECYT] grant number [1181801], both to HC.;;42;2;2;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0021-9266;2157-6009;;J BIOL EDUC;J.

We screened 2nd-grade students (N = 84) with a standardized Spanish vocabulary measure. We then randomly assigned students who scored below the 40th percentile (n = 30) to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received small-group vocabulary instruction 3 times per week. The comparison group received instruction on the same words from the teacher in the whole group. Results indicated significant large effects of the intervention on student vocabulary knowledge of taught words at posttest (g = 1.60) and 4 months later (g = 0.92). Effects were nonsignificant, though moderate, for reading comprehension (g = 0.50). Students in the intervention group were able to articulate significantly more complex sentences using the target words than students in the comparison group.

The aim of the present study was to describe and characterise knowledge about evolution among 120 freshman undergraduate students of two natural sciences programmes (environmental biology and veterinary medicine), 80 pre-service science teachers (elementary and biology) and 45 in-service teachers (elementary and biology high school) in Santiago, Chile. The research was carried out based on an eight-question questionnaire about evolution acceptance and understanding. The instrument included seven Likert-scale questions and one open-ended question. An analysis of the data revealed that more than 70% of teachers (pre-service and in-service) and undergraduate students recognised the theory of evolution as established scientific knowledge. When participants discussed the mechanism of evolution in the open-ended question, the most prevalent responses from students and teachers (33%) explained evolution as need-driven changes for survival purposes. Only 13% of the responses could be considered Darwinian, and 10% of responses included more than one view of evolution. The Darwinian responses generally included three important aspects: variation, inheritance and differential reproduction. The implications for biology teacher education are also discussed in this study.;"[Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile; [Jimenez, Juan] IIT, Math & Sci Educ Dept, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Santibanez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Claudia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile";;Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;hernan.cofre@ucv.cl;;", hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457";Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1,131,029];This work was partially supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), under Grant 1,131,029 to the first author.;;39;13;13;1;34;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0021-9266;2157-6009;;J BIOL EDUC;J.

Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to test the role of NOS instruction in enhancing students' learning about evolution. We used a quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-tests to investigate the impact of teaching evolution with and without NOS in two classes with 15-16-year-old students, who were randomly assigned to these two classes. To measure their understanding of NOS and their acceptance and understanding of evolution, we used three different instruments that have been shown to generate reliable and valid inferences in comparable populations. The main results of this study were that, in the class in which the teaching of evolution included NOS instruction, the students' understanding of NOS and their acceptance of evolution significantly improved. However, irrespective of the use of NOS instruction, both classes increased their understanding of evolution.

Several factors influence clinicians' inclination towards research: the medical school experience, exposure to research article reading and writing, and knowledge of research. This cohort study follows up medical students at time of graduation to explore changes in their inclination towards research and pursuing a research career compared to their inclination at time of entry into medical school. Methods: Students from medical schools in six different countries were enrolled in their first year of school and followed-up upon graduation in their final year. Students answered the same self-administered questionnaire at both time points. Changes in inclination towards research and pursuing a research career were assessed. Factors correlated with these changes were analysed. Results: Of the 777 medical students who responded to the study questionnaire at entry into medical school, 332 (42.7%) completed the follow-up survey. Among these 332 students, there was no significant increase in inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Students from a United States based school, in contrast to those from schools other countries, were more likely to report having research role models to guide them (51.5% vs. 0%-26.4%) and to have published in a peer-reviewed journal (75.7% vs. 8.9%-45%). Absence of a role model was significantly associated with a decrease in inclination towards research, while an increased desire to learn more about statistics was significantly associated with an increase in inclination towards pursuing a research career. Conclusion: Most medical students did not experience changes in their inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Factors that increased their inclination to undertaking research or pursuing a research career were availability of a good role model, and a good knowledge of both the research process and the analytical tools required.;"[Ha, Tam Cam; Yong, Sook Kwin; Tan, Say Beng; Malhotra, Rahul; Ostbye, Truls] Natl Univ Singapore, Duke NUS Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Ha, Tam Cam] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Ng, Sheryl; Chen, Cynthia; Koh, Gerald C.

Academic language might be one of the factors influencing the quality of written texts, given that prior research has shown its impact on reading comprehension. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of Spanish Core Academic Language Skills (S-CALS) and academic vocabulary to the quality of written argumentation and explanation. For this study, 126 Chilean 8th grade students produced an argumentative text and an explanatory text about the same topic. In addition, their academic vocabulary was assessed with the S-AVoc-T test and their CALS with the S-CALS-I test. Results show that both CALS and academic vocabulary are significantly and positively correlated with both writing tasks. Even though these instruments make different contributions to the predictive models in each discursive genre, a Principal Component Analysis revealed that the model that best explains writing quality are those which combine both language variables, namely Spanish Core Academic Language and Vocabulary Skills (S-CALVS). In argumentation, the S-CALVS model explains 29% of the variance, after controlling by gender. In contrast, in explanation, S-CALVS explains 35% of the variance. It is concluded that it is relevant to develop situated writing in each discursive genre and, upon that basis, to work with both CALS and academic vocabulary, because they have a specific impact on academic texts writing.;"[Figueroa, Javiera; Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Figueroa, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.;jfigueroami@uc.cl;"Chandia, Eugenio/ABH-9041-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017; Figueroa, Javiera/H-8181-2017";"Chandia, Eugenio/0000-0003-2489-1226; Figueroa, Javiera/0000-0003-1677-3932";"FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150238]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate [21130191]; Doctoral Program in Education, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile";This study was conducted as part of FONDECYT REGULAR Project number 1150238, funded by CONICYT, Chile, and a CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate/21130191 scholarship.

This work provides the evaluation of intervention in music and humanities (MH) on the general self-efficacy (study 1) and qualifications (study 2) of students from different schools in the Maule Region. The first study shows that the intervention generates changes in the participants' perception of efficacy, both over time and relative to a control group. The second study occurs after the activities and shows that participation leads to more favorable grades, mediated by self-efficacy.

In this study, approaches to teaching ranged from a focus on the teacher and the taught content to a focus on the student and their learning, resembling those reported in previous investigations. Approaches to e-teaching ranged from a focus on information transmission to a focus on communication and collaboration. An analysis of perceptions of the teaching situation in relation to e-learning identified key themes influencing adopted approaches: control of teaching, institutional strategy, pedagogical and technological support, time required, teacher skills for using e-learning, and student abilities and willingness for using learning technology. Associations between these elements showed three groups of teachers: one focusing on transmission of information teaching both face-to-face and online while having a general negative perception of the teaching situation in relation to e-learning; a second focusing on student learning both face-to-face and online while having a general positive perception; and a third presenting unexpected patterns of associations. These results may be helpful for supporting different groups of teachers in employing e-learning in their on-campus units of study.

Academic reading motivation is conceptualised from the Expectancy-Value Theory, with the respective eponymous dimensions as well as interest, attainment, utility, and cost as subcomponents for task value. MethodsThese motivational variables were measured by the Escala Motivacional por la Lectura Academica (Academic Reading Motivation Scale). Analysis focused on confirming the demotivation process organised by four different educational motivation profile types (clusters), as well as by cohorts. Participants were a total of 785 elementary preservice teachers from seven Chilean universities, both public and private, from six regions of Chile, enrolled in the first, third and last years of their programme. This population was tested, with a subsample (n = 295) retested the following year. ResultsResults show a concentration of negative motivational changes in the school motivation group, as well as changes during the first years of the programme. The more affected dimensions are utility and cost. There is no evidence for changes in feeling of competence for academic reading (expectancy). ConclusionsWe conclude the importance of focusing efforts on avoiding these negative motivational changes in students that demonstrate three key characteristics: they want to become primary teachers, they are engaged in their studies, and finally, they want to work in the school system. HighlightsWhat is already known about this topic Academic reading is fundamental for professional training. There is evidence of motivational changes during teacher training. What this paper adds Shows evidence of demotivation in academic reading during teaching training. Identifies when these changes occur.

The tested model confirms the expected results but notes that self-efficacy does not show a significant direct effect on performance. Therefore, a second model is tested. We include self-efficacy as a predictor of academic engagement, eliminating the direct effect of this variable on performance. The results show a greater adjustment in the second model. It is concluded that: (a) positive emotions and autonomy support predict academic performance, self-efficacy and academic engagement; (b) self-efficacy predicts higher levels of academic engagement and the latter improves academic performance, and (c) indirect effects also show the existence of a mediation of these variables on the predictive relationship of autonomy support and positive emotions on performance.

Two-hundred and eighty one children (mean age 6.55years) participated. Print exposure was measured with a book-cover recognition task in first grade, and outcomes were measured both in first and second grade. Print exposure had direct effects on all outcomes in first grade and indirect effects in second grade. Effects on first grade reading comprehension were partially mediated by listening comprehension and word reading, but not vocabulary. We discuss the importance of the findings for improving reading comprehension in countries with low access to books.;"[Strasser, Katherine; Vergara, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Francisca del Rio, M.] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;kstrasse@uc.cl;;"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; del Rio, M.

Among the abilities known to be relevant for young children's understanding of stories are the size of their vocabulary, their inference-making ability, and their working memory. In this study, we examine the role of other processes in explaining preschool children's story comprehension, in a sample of 257 Chilean kindergarten children from middle-income families. The processes we examine are comprehension monitoring, theory of mind, inhibition, and attention control. Mediation relations suggested by theory and previous research are examined between working memory and comprehension, through integrative processes, and between vocabulary breadth and comprehension, through vocabulary depth. We use two different measures of story comprehension to clarify the role that each predictor plays in different aspects of this complex skill. Results suggest that when the story comprehension measure requires construction of a coherent representation, vocabulary, monitoring, inferences, working memory, inhibitory skill, and attention, but not theory of mind, make a significant contribution. Effects of vocabulary breadth are mediated by vocabulary depth, and effects of working memory are partially mediated by monitoring and inferences. When story comprehension is measured through recall of isolated story elements, only working memory and vocabulary explain significant variance. Theoretical as well as practical implications are discussed.;"[Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [del Rio, Francisca] Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile.;"kstrasse@uc.cl; francisca.delrio@mail.udp.cl";;"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; del Rio, M.

While a large body of research has addressed reading comprehension and written production independently, very little investigation has examined the possible relationships between these two psycholinguistic processes, particularly from a discourse and cognitive perspective. Argumentative texts were analyzed in the present investigation on reading-writing connections. Four tests were designed and tested on 439 eighth graders. The tests assessed psycholinguistic variables that account for the microstructural, macrostructural and superstructural levels of comprehension/production processing. Correlation results showed significant coefficients between reading and writing of argumentative texts in all the psycholinguistic levels analyzed. These results suggest that the processes involved in both activities share some common knowledge-based strategies.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Grad Sch Linguist, Valparaiso, Chile;;Parodi, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Grad Sch Linguist, Av Brasil 28-30,9th Floor, Valparaiso, Chile.;gparodi@ucv.cl;;;;;;83;32;34;3;20;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0922-4777;;;READ WRIT;Read.

Even less addressed it within the Chilean educational system. The specific objective of this study was to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of the vocabulary produced by Chilean 4th grade students. Based on a national writing survey, a sample of 2056 texts written by 685 students was collected (narrative, persuasive, and informative texts). Current literature defines lexical quality as a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. To represent the properties of the vocabulary, a set of indicators were selected: (a) lexical diversity; (b) lexical sophistication; and (c) lexical density. Using multilevel modeling (students and schools as levels 1 and 2) to explain a global writing score we found that diversity was a significant determinant for narrative and persuasive texts, density was a significant determinant for the three genres and sophistication was a significant determinant for narrative and expository text. In addition, indicators related to gender and socioeconomic conditions were only significant determinants of narrative stories. The parts of speech most often used also varied according to the purpose of each text. In all genres, words had a short extension and were very sensitive to the input presented in the stimuli. These results imply a significant challenge to this education system: how to promote the development of vocabulary in all children in order to support language learning.";"[Gomez Vera, Gabriela; Sotomayor, Carmen; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bedwell, Percy; Maria Dominguez, Ana] Arauco Fdn, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez Vera, Gabriela] Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;"Vera, GG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Vera, GG (corresponding author), Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.";gabriela.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez Vera, Gabriela/0000-0002-6842-3953;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy [79112008]";Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003 and CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy No. 79112008 are gratefully acknowledged.;;41;6;7;0;16;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0922-4777;1573-0905;;READ WRIT;Read.

However, it has also been found that RAN is a valid predictor of mathematical performance. This study explores the relationship between RAN, counting and arithmetic fluency in Chilean first graders. A total of 102 participants were evaluated with RAN letters, phonological awareness, counting, arithmetical fluency, inhibition and verbal working memory. Results show moderate correlations between RAN and counting with arithmetical fluency. After controlling for the effect of all the variables, RAN still explains a significant variance of arithmetical fluency. Although the nature of the relationship between RAN and arithmetical fluency is multi-componential, our results only confirm the role of working memory when simultaneous counting is considered in the model. Therefore, RAN is not only an important cognitive variable related to reading processes but also a key one for mathematical skills, especially when they involve a fluency component.;"[Escobar, Jose-Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Dev Inclus Technol, Santiago, Chile; [Porflitt, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Ceric, Francisco] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Escobar, JP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus CEDETI UC, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.;jpescobar@uc.cl;;"Porflitt, Felipe/0000-0001-9789-9080; Escobar, Jose-Pablo/0000-0001-9749-0285";FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141083];This work was supported by Fondecyt under Grant 1141083.;;83;0;0;4;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0144-3410;1469-5820;;EDUC PSYCHOL-UK;Educ.

However, the cognitive and linguistic skills that underlie online inference making remain elusive. The authors aimed to clarify the effects of vocabulary and text comprehension on word-to-text integration during reading. In a self-paced reading study, the authors measured participants' integration of words across sentence boundaries by comparing reading times at a critical word and the subsequent region, when preceded by the same critical word (repetition condition), by a lexically associated word (association condition), or by a word with no direct lexical link (inference condition). Furthermore, the authors assessed vocabulary knowledge, text comprehension, working memory, decoding, and fluid intelligence in the sample. Results showed that richer vocabulary was associated with immediate integration, as evidenced by reading time differences between the critical word and the subsequent word in the inference condition. Other individual differences did not predict self-paced reading times. Findings suggest that lexical knowledge plays a stronger role relative to other individual skills in online inference making and contributes to refining understanding of the mechanisms that underlie efficient reading.;"[Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Kronmueller, Edmundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;"Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile.";"ernesto.guerra@ciae.uchile.cl; ekr@uc.cl";;Guerra, Ernesto/0000-0001-7403-5271;"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT [11171074]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";"This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT No 11171074 to Ernesto Guerra.

Descriptive information is given showing the level of literacy knowledge of the children and the literacy experiences that they encounter both at home and in the classroom. Multiple regression is used to test the effect of home and instruction variables on emergent literacy learning in kindergarten and later in first grade. Findings show that Chilean children in the sample are exposed to less literacy experiences than children in developed countries, at home and at school. Results also show that, in spite of little explicit code instruction going on in classrooms, this measure had a positive significant effect on literacy growth in kindergarten.

Methods: Through an iterative process, an international group of 15 experts developed an initial set of learning outcomes following a review and discussion of relevant international and local literature. A two-round Delphi survey involving 46 experts from 8 countries was performed. Quantative and qualitative analisis permited the definition of the final consensus. Results: The initial proposal included 157 learning outcomes. The Delphi process generated 734 comments and involved the modification, deletion and addition of some outcomes. At the end of the process, a consensus was reached on 136 learning outcomes grouped under 6 competency domains with a high overall acceptance (95.1 %).

This research aims to understand learners' sensorial perception of materials as stimuli and what constitutes the most appropriate communication channel for learning about their characteristics without losing information in accordance with their VAK learning styles-visual, auditory and kinaesthetic-. Seventy-five people participated in this workshop. Using evaluation tools in a test format, they evaluated all the sensory properties of the following materials: Alusion (TM), PolarMoss, and Silkworms. These three materials were presented in various interaction formats, called channels: a text plus image-C1-, video-C2-, and a physical sample plus audio-C3-. Two types of experiments were carried out: mixed per person-interaction with the three materials in a different channel each time in random order-and blocked per person-interaction with the same material in the three channels, in an order of C1-C3. The data obtained was analysed using mixed models with the channel as a fixed factor and the individuals and material as the random factors. The most relevant results indicate significant differences between channels in accordance with the sensory property, normally C2 and C3. The level of responses between the two experiments is similar, therefore showing that the order C1-C2-C3 does not affect perception. Although the three learning styles-visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic-coexist in the participants, the vast majority agree that they prefer C3 as easier to evaluate, more entertaining and the best way to learn.;"[Abella, Ainoa; Araya Leon, Maria; Cleries Garcia, Laura] ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain; [Abella, Ainoa; Marco-Almagro, Lluis] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain; [Araya Leon, Maria] Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile";;"Abella, A (corresponding author), ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain.; Abella, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain.";aabella@elisava.net;;"Marco-Almagro, Lluis/0000-0002-0440-1675; Abella, Ainoa/0000-0001-6375-0317; Araya Leon, Maria Jose/0000-0001-7284-6943";;;;29;0;0;1;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

In this scenario, there needs to be a renewed attention to the instilment of general epistemic beliefs that facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and the incorporation of social science practices. In other words, there is a need for a social turn in engineering education. In the following case study, we examine the learning process of 45 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in an Anthro-Design course at a private university in Chile. This course teaches students to use cultural anthropology and design tools to generate an applied qualitative research project for real-life counterparts. Under a socio-constructivist approach, we developed a sequential explanatory design, with an emphasis on qualitative data [quant- > QUAL]. We used the three factor Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI) to conduct pre-post assessment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the course to explore representations of key epistemic notions such as objectivity and validity. This study identifies a significant diversity in how epistemic notions such as validity and objectivity are represented by students after undertaking a course that embraces the social turn. This diversity can also be observed in non-epistemic notions related to the learning experience. We argue that a better understanding of the research process and the handling of qualitative information under rigorous theoretical frameworks are key to changing beliefs about the nature of knowledge within the engineering-design students' context.;"[Miranda, Constanza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Goni, Julian; Sotomayor, Trinidad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";;Miranda, C (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;constanzamiranda@jhu.edu;Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020;"Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416";;;;102;0;0;2;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

However, most assessment methods are focused on STEM as a whole or only on technology. In this article, we will discuss the instrument called Technology and Engineering Attitude Scale (TEAS) which focuses on attitudes towards technology. Previous studies and applications of this particular scale lacked proper statistical validation of the instrument. The following research looks at the application of an adapted version of the TEAS to assess a GEDC awarded pre-engineering design program in Chile. This version was psychometrically analyzed in 436 cases to validate the interpretations driven by a particular cultural context and specific to the discipline of engineering. The article focuses on the modifications applied to the instrument after the statistical validity process. The discussion is centered on the ethical importance of adapting an existing scale in a valid and reliable way to assess a pre-engineering design program in a local context. Lessons learned and recommendations for future research in this area are proposed based on this particular experience.;"[Miranda, Constanza; Goni, Julian; Pickenpack, Astrid; Sotomayor, Trinidad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Miranda, Constanza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA";;"Miranda, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile.; Miranda, C (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.";constanza.miranda@gmail.com;Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020;"Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416";;;;50;0;0;0;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

Addressing this gap, this study examines the relationship between center-based care attendance during toddler years and children's cognitive outcomes. Research Findings: Data used for this study came from the first and second wave of the Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood (ELPI, 2010 and 2012). The nationally representative sample was 1,544 children aged 12 to 24 months in 2010, who received full-time home care during this period. Propensity score matching (PSM) and difference-in-differences techniques were used in the study. Compared to those in full-time home care, children who attended center-based care from the age of 24 months had higher cognitive scores in the endline (they were measured at some point between 36 and 48 months old). Children in center-based care scored higher on cognitive skills compared to children who were in full-time home care, according to the Child Development and Cognitive Evaluation Test (Test de Aprendizaje y Desarrollo Infantil, TADI) and the Battelle test (d = .21 p p < .01, respectively). However, we observed that children in low-income households benefited less from early center-based care attendance. Practice or Policy: These findings suggest that Chilean national policies supporting increased center-based care coverage in early years are a step in the right direction, but more work focused on helping disadvantaged children is needed.;"[Narea, Marigen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Narea, Marigen] Ctr Adv Studies Educ Justice CJE, Santiago, Chile; [Allel, Kasim] Univ Mayor, Hlth & Soc Res Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Allel, Kasim; Arriagada, Veronica] Adv Studies Educ Justice CJE), Santiago, Chile";;Narea, M (corresponding author), Escuela Psicol, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;mnarea@uc.cl;"Narea, Marigen/AAV-8499-2021; Narea, Marigen/AAM-5704-2020; Allel, Kasim/C-3435-2017";"Narea, Marigen/0000-0001-7780-7425; Allel, Kasim/0000-0002-2144-7181; Arriagada, Veronica/0000-0002-4517-0957";CONICYT PIA [CIE160007];This article was funded by CONICYT PIA CIE160007;;73;4;4;2;19;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-9289;1556-6935;;EARLY EDUC DEV;Early Educ.

We follow a cohort of 80,000 children from preschool to the end of schooling. Results show that ECCE participants had better academic outcomes than their peers who did not participated in ECCE in national tests in 4(th), 10(th), and 12(th) grade. ECCE participants also were less likely to repeat a grade or to dropout of school.

Nineteen classrooms from Santiago de Chile participated (10 intervention, 9 control). Twice a week, intervention teachers filled out a checklist to monitor the language stimulation they offered children. Research personnel used the checklists to elaborate a monthly summary of the language opportunities offered to each child in that month and discussed this information with teachers. Results revealed a significant advantage for intervention teachers in frequency of book readings and word discussions but not on children's language growth. Dosage analyses showed that children identified by the self-monitoring device as receiving more language-learning opportunities improved significantly more from beginning to end of the school year in receptive vocabulary. Practice or Policy: Contextual barriers such as large numbers of children and unawareness of the impact of some language interactions can prevent teachers from engaging in important practices. Reminding teachers of the importance of those practices and helping them monitor their frequency may be a low-cost way of improving language opportunities for children in contexts where more intensive professional development is not possible.;"[Strasser, Katherine; Vergara, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Mendive, Susana; Darricades, Michelle] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;kstrasse@uc.cl;Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017;"Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798";;;;79;4;4;1;12;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-9289;1556-6935;;EARLY EDUC DEV;Early Educ.

Eighteen classrooms serving low-income children between the ages of 3 and 4 in Santiago de Chile were audio-recorded during one morning shift. Recordings were transcribed and segmented into activities (greeting, learning experience, book sharing, book discussion, breakfast, lunch, free play and other noninstructional time). A total of 113 activity segments were identified. Characteristics of teacher and child language were measured in each segment. Differences between the eight activities were examined using analysis of variance. Activities were classified as instructional or noninstructional, and the association between this dimension and language characteristics was examined using multilevel path analysis. Results show that most of the variance in language outcomes occurs within classrooms. Analyses show that a significant portion of the variance in the way teachers and children talk is explained by the instructional/noninstructional dimension. Instructional activities are characterized by more language stimulation, more teaching, fewer directives, and more child talk than noninstructional activities.

Tolerance of corruption counteracts this assumption. We studied tolerance of corruption among 8th graders from Latin-American samples of the International Civic and Citizenship Study 2009. We proposed a model where associations between students' socioeconomic status (SES) and tolerance of corruption are explained by civic knowledge, authoritarianism and open classroom discussion. This model accounted for 36-43% of the variance within schools, and 87-96% of the variance between schools, across six countries. The socioeconomic gap in tolerance of corruption was mainly present between schools. In addition, students with higher civic knowledge were less tolerant of corruption, partially explained by authoritarianism, while open classroom discussion also had indirect associations with tolerance of corruption.;"[Carrasco, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Banerjee, Robin] Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Trevino, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, CEPPE, Santiago, Chile";;Carrasco, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile.;dacarras@uc.cl;"Villalobos, Cristobal/AAK-9559-2020; Carrasco, Diego/ABE-4483-2020; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015";"Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213; Banerjee, Robin/0000-0002-4994-3611; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302";"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180667]; Ministerio de Educacion, Gobierno de Chile; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PIA 160007]; Centro de Estudios Avanzados (CJE)";"Research funded by the Ministerio de Educacion, Gobierno de Chile and Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYT (PIA 160007), Centro de Estudios Avanzados (CJE); and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYT No 1180667.";;76;3;3;1;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0144-3410;1469-5820;;EDUC PSYCHOL-UK;Educ.

The objective was to analyse the validity of the factorial structure of a scale designed to assess the construct coexistence in school on students of primary education. The sample, 2447 primary education students from Chile and Spain. An exploratory and then a confirmatory analysis factor were run to test the validity of a structure composed by: Positive Interpersonal Management, Victimization, Disruptiveness, Peer Social Network, Aggression, Normative Adjustment, Indiscipline, and Teacher Apathy. The results proved that the eight-factor structure is suitable for the Chilean population. In addition, the results revealed invariance across both populations.

Classroom observation often carries a considerable weight in teacher appraisal and improvement systems, and provides the critical formative anchor informing professional development. This study examined a purposively selected sample of sixteen classroom observation systems in six countries, including high performing Singapore and Japan, regional exemplar Chile, the three largest school districts in the United States, and other interesting examples in Australia, Germany and the United States to add diversity to the sample. The study offers an analytic framework for understanding classroom observation systems across contexts, distinguishing conceptual, methodological and policy aspects that shape these systems. The sixteen systems were remarkably consistent in their stated overall purposes, but there was variation in terms of how they operationalized good teaching, the degree of standardization of the observation process, emphasis on validation, and information uses. The paper describes and discusses these characteristics in order to help researchers and policymakers reflect on the available options and take more informed decisions in designing classroom observation for evaluating and improving teaching.

Study 1 examined the effect of word elaboration on story comprehension with 72 children. Children who were exposed to elaborations of unknown words during storybook reading achieved better comprehension than those who were not after vocabulary and narrative comprehension skills were controlled. This effect was mediated by children's learning of the elaborated words and thus provides evidence for the causal role of word knowledge in story comprehension. Study 2 examined the effect of asking questions about coherence relations versus other kinds of open-ended questions such as requests for predictions, descriptions, and real-life connections. Children exposed to coherence questions achieved better story comprehension than those exposed to other open-ended questions after initial vocabulary, narrative comprehension skills, and attentiveness were controlled. Practice or Policy: These findings suggest the use of specific reading strategies for improving comprehension. Teaching rare words and asking coherence-related questions during reading leads to better understanding of the story. These are 2 easy methods that could be integrated into daily teaching practices to help improve children's narrative comprehension.;"[Strasser, Katherine; Rosa Lissi, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;kstrasse@uc.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;"Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Lissi, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-9740-6853";;;;68;27;28;4;55;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-9289;1556-6935;;EARLY EDUC DEV;Early Educ.

We examined the contribution of rhetorical competence to reading comprehension on two groups of 11- to 13-year-old students: low-level (Study 1) and high-level (Study 2) reading skills. The measures of rhetorical competence assessed students' knowledge about anaphors, organisational signals and refutations. In both studies, each measure of rhetorical competence contributed significantly to reading comprehension once prior knowledge, working memory and decoding skills were controlled for. This contribution was higher in Study 2. Furthermore, whereas in Study 1, each measure of rhetorical competence had a unique contribution to reading comprehension when controlling for the other measures of rhetorical competence, in Study 2, only the knowledge about organisational signals and refutations had this unique contribution.;"[Garcia, J.

Latin America, as other developing regions, has increased its university enrolment of underrepresented, historically excluded students, through a variety of policies. This study analyzes the experiences of the first cohort of a national inclusive admissions program in Chile. Drawing from 45 in-depth interviews, it aims to understand how students perceive themselves and the obstacles they face, using academic literacy as a lens. Results show a recurring reproduction of dominant deficit discourses by the students, as they feel at a disadvantage and blame their previous education; additionally, negative self-perceptions are more frequent in students from the most competitive programs. Nevertheless, these perceptions contrast with student agency, resilience, and self-sponsored strategies that emerged in the interviews as resources for making sense of university, an unforeseen environment for the participants and their families. Furthermore, interviews reveal that these students face additional challenges pertaining to adverse material conditions that shape their university experience, such as commuting extremely long distances or working for a living. Overall, this research depicts a complex picture of intertwined factors that challenges the deficit framework and should be considered in developing equitable admissions policies.

Its appearance during the first years of schooling is linked to school failure and dropout, violent behaviors, mental health problems, and maladaptive trajectories that persist for the rest of an individual's life. The goal of this study was to identify psychosocial adversity variables capable of predicting the appearance of SM during the first three years of school. By collecting data on school maladjustment, adverse childhood experiences and psychosocial dysfunction, a longitudinal follow-up process was applied to a cohort of 26,108 Chilean students (50.7% female) from the start of their schooling (6.3 years of age in 1st grade) until two years later (8.4 year age mean in 3st grade). Through binary logistic regressions, the results obtained show that mother's adolescent pregnancy, biological father's absence, mental pathology in a relative, psychosocial dysfunction, and teacher's negative perception of students' academic and behavioral performance predict the appearance of SM after three years in the school system.

Teacher-child interactions were assessed when the children were 12 (n=99) and 30 months old (n=73), using the Adult Sensitivity Scale, the Evaluation of the Mentalization of the Significant Caregivers, the Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO), and Bayley's language scale for children's outcomes. Profiles were identified in person-centred within-group analyses of six dimensions: sensitivity, mentalization, affection, responsiveness, encouragement and teaching. Research Findings: Cluster analyses yielded three profiles. In the first group, profiles were organized according to their competence levels and were identified as highly, average and poorly competent. In the second group, a clearer distinction appeared between cognitive versus affective approaches, and the teachers were classified as competent cognitive, competent affective and poorly competent. Teachers' profiles were related to children's receptive language skills at both ages, and the competent cognitive profile at 30 months was a significant predictor of receptive language skills.

Adults with high mentalization promote children's secure attachment, mentalization and self-regulation. This study describes this competency in a sample of teachers from Chilean nurseries in interaction with 12-month-old children during a storytelling scenario and compares it with the children's mothers. The sample comprised 208 adults (104 teachers and 104 mothers). The adults were asked to tell 2 stories to the children, and these situations were recorded, transcribed, and codified using guidelines that identified 4 references to mental states (desires, cognitions, emotions, and attributes) and 4 references to nonmental states (causal and factual talk, physical states, and connections with the child's life). Research Findings: The results showed significant differences between the educational staff and the mothers, and the teachers performed better than the mothers in terms of both greater mentalization and a greater number of references to desires, causal talk, emotions, and physical states.

Participants were two groups of first grade children; one group were at risk of developing mathematics disabilities (MLD-at-risk, n= 32), and the other included typically developing (non-MLD, n= 32) children. Of all the cognitive measures, backward digit span (BDS) tasks and RAN-Letter made significant contributions to differentiating group performance. RAN-Letter provided differentiation of groups, and BDS provided differentiation of the growth rates of both groups in number processing skills. These results highlight the relevance of RAN and BDS for the development of number processing skills in first grade, especially for MLD-at-risk children. BDS is therefore a very important task to be measured during the early stages of mathematics instruction, because it predicts deficits in development of number skills.

The purpose of this study is to identify and describe different school climate profiles by evaluating variables at the individual, family and community levels in Chilean students. The sample consists of 2,683 adolescent students (51.2% men and 48.8% women), aged between 12 and 20 years (M = 15.78, SD = 1.35), and from 32 Chilean educational institutions. Results obtained from a multilevel latent class cluster analysis show that the model with six clusters of students and two class of institutions proves to be the most parsimonious model and with the best fit to the data. School climate profiles were built on the basis of four indicators: school climate (Wald = 301.065, p < .001), student-teacher relationships (Wald = 226.687, p < .001), positive attitude towards authority (Wald = 115.591, p < .001) and positive attitude towards norm transgression (Wald = 3705.593, p < .001). All of them are to be useful indicators for profile segmentation. Covariates that are associated with school climate profiles identified: at the individual level, age (p = .019) and sex (p < .001); at the family level, family structure (p < .001); at the school level, type of educational institution (p = .002); and at the community level, the perception of insecurity in the neighborhood (p = .011), social control (p = .002) and support (p < .001).

The present study sets out to explore whether readers' knowledge of rhetorical devices (that is, rhetorical competence) moderates their effectiveness beyond general comprehension skills and, consequently, whether rhetorical competence may be considered a component skill of reading comprehension. 192 sixth- to seventh-grade students were assessed on rhetorical competence and were required to read a difficult marked text with specific rhetorical devices (a refutation, an objective, and four organizational signals) or the same text without them. After reading, students produced a summary in order to obtain three dependent variables: main ideas (as a measure of participants' ability to select relevant information from the text), causal links between them (as an indicator of participants' ability to grasp the logical structure of the text and to organize its ideas), and the combination of main ideas plus causal links (as an indicator of participants' global comprehension of the text). Analyses controlling for general comprehension skills and other important variables (working memory, prior knowledge, decoding) demonstrated that: (a) readers of the marked text scored higher in terms of all dependent variables, and (b) rhetorical competence level moderated the effect of rhetorical devices on the composite measure (main ideas plus causal links) and on the organization of the summary by means of causal links.;"[Sanchez, Emilio] Univ Salamanca, Fac Psychol, Dept Educ & Dev Psychol, Avda Merced 109-131, Salamanca 37005, Spain; [Garcia, J.

In this study, we explore a more inclusive operationalization of an academic-language proficiency construct, core academic-language skills (CALS). CALS refers to a constellation of high-utility language skills hypothesized to support reading comprehension across school content areas. Using the Core Academic Language Skills Instrument (CALS-I), a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust innovative tool, we first examined the variability in students' CALS by grade, English-proficiency designation, and socioeconomic status (SES). Then, we examined the contribution of CALS to reading comprehension using academic vocabulary knowledge, word reading fluency, and sociodemographic factors as covariates. A linguistically and socioeconomically diverse cross-sectional sample of 218 students (grades 4-6) participated in four assessments: the CALS-I, a standardized reading comprehension assessment (Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test), an academic vocabulary test (Vocabulary Association Test), and a word reading fluency test (Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency). General linear model analysis of variance revealed that CALS differed significantly by grade, English-proficiency designation, and SES, with students in higher grades, English-proficient students, and those from higher SES backgrounds displaying higher scores, on average. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified CALS as an independent predictor of reading comprehension, even after controlling for academic vocabulary knowledge, word reading fluency, and sociodemographic factors. By specifying a set of language skills associated with reading comprehension, this study advances our understanding of school-relevant language skills, making them more visible for researchers and educators.;"[Uccelli, Paola; Galloway, Emily Phillips] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barr, Christopher D.] Univ Houston, Texas Inst Measurement Evaluat & Stat, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Dobbs, Christina L.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA";;Uccelli, P (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;paola_uccelli@gse.harvard.edu;Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017;;;;;112;119;121;9;54;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0034-0553;1936-2722;;READ RES QUART;Read.

The study had the objective of exploring the occurrence of self and social aspects of regulation during collaborative activities within regular primary science classes. Through a multiple case study approach, 8 children organised in two work groups were videotaped working in collaborative activities during one academic semester. The findings show a general increase of SRL activity within the groups during the semester, and positive relationships between focus of the activity and type of social regulation. The study sheds light on the advantages of combining analytical and holistic analysis when researching collaborative activities in the classroom.

In order to do this, the present study is aimed at assessing the psychometric properties of the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation, an interview for teachers that measures school adjustment difficulties. The study evaluated 10,287 adolescents participating in a Chilean public program for improving mental health in schools. Of the total sample, 5,815 (56.5%) students were in 6th grade and were 12.91 years old on average (SD= 1391). Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify four dimensions (behavioral, learning, social, and autonomy-related difficulties), which were tested using structural equations. Reliability analyses show that all factors have high levels of internal consistency and differ according to age, grade, and extreme poverty.

Participants were 180 Chilean children from backgrounds of low and high socioeconomic status (SES), their mothers, and their fathers. A path analysis was used to explore the influences of both maternal and paternal numeracy practices on children's numeracy performance and the influences of maternal and paternal expectations and anxiety on those activities. Research Findings: Results showed that mothers and fathers who endorse higher numeracy expectations for their children and who report lower levels of math anxiety also report engaging more frequently in advanced numeracy practices with their children. Mothers'-but not fathers'-engagement in numeracy practices at home predicted children's numeracy performance. Also, low-SES mothers engaged more frequently in numeracy practices with their children, and mothers in general engaged more often in numeracy activities with girls than with boys. Practice or Policy: These findings improve understanding of how maternal and paternal processes relate differently to numeracy performance in kindergarten children. Moreover, these results highlight the need to take into account parents' numeracy attitudes and practices, as well as their SES, when designing interventions directed at increasing family support for math achievement.;"[Francisca del Rio, M.] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Educ, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile; [Ines Susperreguy, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Salinas, Viviana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Sociol, Santiago, Chile";;del Rio, MF (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Sch Educ, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile.;francisca.delrio@mail.udp.cl;"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019";"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; del Rio, M.

(2) Was there gradual developmental growth of the most complex concepts' networks of associated concepts from the beginning of a program to the end? That is, for the most complex concepts, did associated concepts begin to appear in the early grades, with gradual cumulative addition of associated concepts throughout the elementary grades? Gradual accumulation of associated concepts could enable students to progressively construct a mental network of concepts within which a more complex concept could be situated, a network that could facilitate learning of most complex concepts. Two best-selling, contemporary elementary-grades core science programs constituted the data source. The researchers employed two measures: a conceptual complexity measure and the number of associated concepts (called nodes in concept networks) for each of the most complex concepts. The researchers conducted multilevel modeling and found that, on the whole, the programs exposed students to increasingly complex concepts with the rise of grades. Few highly complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Similarly, few associated concepts for the most complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Instead, associated concepts tended to be introduced simultaneously with the most complex concepts in the later grades. That is, on the whole, the programs did not expose students to the opportunity to construct strong affiliated concept networks (clusters of associated constructs) prior to introduction of the most complex concepts.;"[Fitzgerald, W.

In European school evaluation systems, one main intended use of classroom observation results is to inform schools' instructional improvement efforts. This study examined the quality of such diagnostic information in the context of a school evaluation system in Germany. The factor analytic results indicate that the empirical structure of the observation instrument lacks correspondence with its original normative model but does mirror a five-factor model based on recent literature, including classroom management, two different aspects of student orientation, cognitive activation, and classroom assessment. The generalizability analyses show that both indicators and observers represent important sources of measurement error. Additionally, their magnitude is larger for shorter observations (lesson segments).

Children (N = 81) first viewed a narrative picture sequence and then completed the narrative production task in each of two orders: either before or after answering a set of questions about the core elements of the story. Narratives elicited after questions were more coherent than those produced before the questions. In contrast, task order did not influence the cohesion of narratives nor the accuracy of responses to questions. An independent measure of memory was related to the gains in narrative coherence after answering questions. The results are discussed in relation to the role of questions as a guide to the structural elements of a narrative and a scaffold for understanding.;"[Silva, Macarena; Cain, Kate] Univ Lancaster, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, England; [Silva, Macarena] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Silva, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;macarena.silva@ciae.uchile.cl;"Silva, Macarena/C-7701-2014; , CIAE/R-5423-2017";"Silva, Macarena/0000-0002-5830-0837; Cain, Kate/0000-0003-2780-188X";"Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT [FB 0003]; Conicyt-Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140887]";This project has been possible through Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB 0003, from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT and Conicyt-Fondecyt Project No 11140887.;;52;7;8;1;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0141-0423;1467-9817;;J RES READ;J.

J;Darwin, S;;;;Darwin, Stephen;;;What contemporary work are student ratings actually doing in higher education?;STUDIES IN EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Student ratings; Student evaluation; Higher education; Quantitative evaluation; Qualitative evaluation; Teacher development; Academic development";"PROFESSIONALISM; FEEDBACK";It is conventionally assumed that student ratings perform a significant function in driving improvement in pedagogical practices in higher education. As a result, this form of evaluation has gradually become institutionalised in recent decades as an essential proxy for understanding teaching and course quality in universities across the world. However, with the rise of market-based models in higher education and heightened expectations for accountability mechanisms, the role and functional purpose of ratings-based student evaluation have become increasingly confused. This rising ambiguity has created strong tensions between the seminal drive of student ratings as a tool of quality improvement, and the emerging demands for its use as a transparent accountability measure for the comparative assessment of academic performativity. So are student ratings now largely a tool of quality assurance or performance measurement, or do they remain a legitimate tool for pedagogical improvement? This paper reports on a study that responded to this critical question by considering the contemporary work of student ratings in a major Australian university. The outcomes of this research demonstrate that tension between improvement and accountability motives is causing considerable confusion and discord around the role and value of the student voice. It also reveals that academics are tending to discount the often critical insights of students on the implications of their pedagogical practices as a result of the elevating institutional role of student ratings as a proxy for teaching quality. In considering these outcomes, rising levels of academic dissonance around student ratings would suggest a necessity to consider broadened evaluative strategies that are able to more effectively capture the improvement potential offered by the student voice.

In English, core academic-language skills (CALS) have been found to significantly predict reading comprehension, even controlling for academic vocabulary knowledge. CALS are high-utility language skills that support reading comprehension across school content areas. Guided by an operational definition of Spanish CALS (S-CALS), three goals drove this study: to develop two psychometrically reliable tests, the S-CALS Instrument and the Spanish Academic Vocabulary (S-AVoc) Test; to explore the dimensionality of core academic-language proficiencies, as measured by these two tests; and to examine the contribution of core academic-language proficiencies to reading comprehension. A cross-sectional sample of 810 Chilean students (grades 4-8) participated in four assessments that measured standardized reading comprehension, word-reading fluency, Spanish academic vocabulary, and S-CALS. Using classical test theory and item response theory analyses, results yielded robust reliability evidence for both instruments. Consistent with prior research, S-CALS and academic vocabulary scores displayed upward trends in higher grades yet considerable within-grade variability. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that S-CALS and S-AVoc were best conceptualized as part of a higher order construct, the Spanish core academic-language and vocabulary skills (S-CALVS). The aggregated S-CALVS scores predicted reading comprehension, beyond the contribution of grade, school factors, and word-reading fluency. This study advances our scientific understanding of CALS as relevant for adolescent literacy beyond the English language. The high-utility school-relevant language and vocabulary skills offer promising tools to inform and evaluate innovative reading comprehension interventions for Spanish-speaking adolescents.";"[Meneses, Alejandra; Veronica Santelices, Maria; Figueroa, Javiera] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Uccelli, Paola] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Educ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ruiz, Marcela; Acevedo, Daniela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile";;Meneses, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"amenesea@uc.cl; paola_uccelli@gse.harvard.edu; vsanteli@uc.cl; maruiz@uahurtado.cl; dacevedo@uahurtado.cl; jfigueroami@uc.cl";"Ruiz, Marcela/R-3828-2019; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017; Figueroa, Javiera/H-8181-2017; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015";"Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670; Figueroa, Javiera/0000-0003-1677-3932; Ruiz, Marcela/0000-0003-0260-3430; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047";"David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies as part of the Harvard-Chile Innovation Initiative; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150238]";This research was supported by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies as part of the Harvard-Chile Innovation Initiative, CONICYT 2013, and FONDECYT REGULAR 1150238.

The study surveyed students in the United States (n=1,265) and Chile (n=2,076) across all discipline areas. Descriptive analysis indicated that U.S. students spent 4.94 hours on academic reading, 4.17 hours on extracurricular reading, and 16.40 hours on Facebook weekly. For Chilean students, the figures were 13.17 hours, 3.07 hours, and 14.00 hours, respectively. The results indicated that for both U.S. and Chilean participants, online reading materials were the most popular type of material, followed by magazines/newspapers, graphic novels/comic books, best-selling novels, and nonmajor academic books (books on topics outside the student's major subject in conventional print format). Due to the impact of the Internet on reading resources, students' reading patterns today are different from how they were in the past. College students' reading practices have moved to different venues with the advent of Internet technology, and the modality has migrated to online reading.

Three distinct approaches were identified: Mastery oriented, Task focused and Minimalist in effort. Despite the widespread concern that students will have difficulty managing their time in online courses with high level of student freedom, this study found that the vast majority of learners were very effective in their learning strategies. The findings speak well for the potential of distance education environments to provide high quality self-paced learning, accommodating different learning strategies, which is difficult to do in group-paced courses. We further explored how these approaches relate to and interact with, participants' background and their levels of satisfaction and self reported learning.;"[del Valle, Rodrigo] Univ Catolica Temuco, Temuco, Chile; [Duffy, Thomas M.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA";;del Valle, R (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Montt 56,Casilla 15D, Temuco, Chile.;rvalle@uctemuco.cl;"del Valle, Rodrigo/T-6312-2019; del Valle, Rodrigo T/E-8052-2012";del Valle, Rodrigo T/0000-0001-7707-8605;;;;28;32;33;3;20;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0020-4277;1573-1952;;INSTR SCI;Instr.

It also examined if preparation and efficacy beliefs along with teaching experience (years teaching the language arts) predicted teachers' reported writing practices. The participants were 254 grade four to six language arts teachers in urban schools in Chile. Twenty-five percent of the teachers surveyed reported they taught writing for five or more hours a week. Most teachers, however, reported devoting much less time to the teaching of writing, with 42% of teachers indicating they spent two hours or less a week teaching this skill. Another 33% of teachers reported teaching writing three to four hours a week. Teachers indicated they applied many different evidence-based practices when teaching writing, with a majority of them reporting they used 60% of the identified practices at least once a week. They also reported that they asked students to complete 19 of the 20 identified writing activities at least once a month. Teachers expressed positive beliefs about their preparation to teach writing and their efficacy to do so. Collectively, years teaching the language arts and beliefs about preparation and efficacy significantly and statistically predicted teachers' perceptions of their writing instruction. Additionally, beliefs about preparation and efficacy consistently made a unique and statistically significant positive contribution to predicting teachers' reported writing practices, whereas teaching experience made a unique and statistically negative contribution to predicting one writing practice: the reported assignment of narrative writing tasks.;"[Banales, Gerardo; Ahumada, Silza; Puente, Anibal; Guajardo, Marcela; Munoz, Ignacio] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7591538, Chile; [Graham, Steve] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA";;Graham, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.;"gerardo.banales@unab.cl; steve.graham@asu.edu";;"Ahumada, Silza/0000-0002-6269-4939; Guajardo, Marcela/0000-0003-0022-9254";Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT) (Fondecyt) [1171898];This research was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT) (Fondecyt Regular No. 1171898).;;78;7;7;1;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0922-4777;1573-0905;;READ WRIT;Read.

However, little is known about the effect of reading comprehension performance on writing, as well as the pedagogical guidelines that can be drawn from this influence. Method Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the influence of performance in reading comprehension, distinguishing between poor and proficient readers (N = 105), who were enrolled in four eighth-grade classes between the ages of 12 and 14, on the writing of narrative and expository texts. Results Results revealed that proficient readers outperformed poor readers on objective measures of text production and informative/expository texts. Additionally, regression models demonstrated that proficient readers relied more on deeper aspects of reading and writing such as inferential skills, whereas poor readers tended to focus on superficial aspects of texts, or what Kintsch referred to as text-base, and appeared to perform better in reading and writing tasks related to narratives compared to information-based, expository texts. Conclusion These results support the theoretical perspectives of Kintsch's construction-integration model and Otero's regulation model regarding the relation between reading, writing and mental representations.;"[Gutierrez de Blume, Antonio P.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Curriculum Fdn & Reading, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Soto, Christian; Rodriguez, Fernanda] Univ Concepcion, Dept Spanish, Psycholinguist Area, Concepcion, Chile; [Ramirez Carmona, Camila] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Pino Castillo, Patricio] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;de Blume, APG (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Curriculum Fdn & Reading, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.;agutierrez@georgiasouthern.edu;;"Gutierrez de Blume, Antonio/0000-0001-6809-1728; Pino Castillo, Patricio Andres/0000-0002-0636-5647"; [IT17I0051];"Award Title `Desarrollo de una herramienta computacional para la evaluacion automatica de textos en el sistema escolar chileno' (Development of a computational tool for the automatic evaluation of texts in the Chilean school system; Award No. Fondef IT17I0051).";;51;0;0;2;14;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0141-0423;1467-9817;;J RES READ;J.

The main objective of this study was to examine whether profiting from written metatextual cues to launch reading strategies needs higher level of rhetorical competence than profiting from oral cues. Specifically, this study addresses two questions: (1) Is there a gap between the sensitivity to oral versus written metatextual cues depending on the student's reading skill level? (2) Do the reader's rhetorical competence, general reading comprehension, and decoding levels interact with the processing of each type of metatextual cue? Three hundred sixty-seven students (11-13 years old) summarized an expository text after reading it under one of the following four conditions: with written cues, with oral cues, with both cues combined, or with no cues. The less skilled readers who received oral or combined cues provided better summaries (they selected and organized the main ideas better) than the less skilled readers who received written cues or no cues. However, the performance of the more skilled readers was equal under the conditions with written cues, oral cues, and combined cues; these three groups outperformed the readers from the no-cues condition group. A multicategorical moderator analysis showed that following written cues demanded higher levels of general comprehension and rhetorical competence than following oral and combined cues. These data confirm that rhetorical competence is a specific capability for processing, especially written metatextual cues, and for overcoming the gap between the sensitivity to oral versus written cues.";"[Sanchez, Emilio; Ricardo Garcia, J.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Dev & Educ Psychol, Salamanca, Spain; [Bustos, Andrea] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile";;Garcia, JR (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Dev & Educ Psychol, Salamanca, Spain.;"esanchez@usal.es; jrgarcia@usal.es; andrea.bustos@pucv.cl";Garcia, J.

Next, we explored whether indices of meta-cognitive monitoring predicted reading performance. Finally, we examined whether poor and proficient readers exhibited distinct meta-cognitive profiles with respect to reading comprehension ability. Chilean undergraduate students (N = 146) completed a task on inconsistency detection within texts and a standardised reading comprehension performance measure, which we used, along with confidence in performance judgements, to calculate meta-cognitive monitoring accuracy. Our results confirmed that proficient readers outperformed poor readers on nearly all measures of interest, except global retrospective meta-cognitive monitoring judgements, and that proficient readers performed significantly better on items related to implicit information of texts than poor readers. Additionally, when combined in a single group, number of inconsistencies correctly detected and repaired and accurate global evaluation of learning judgements significantly predicted reading performance whereas retrospective global and local meta-cognitive monitoring judgements did not. Of special significance to our investigation, when separated in two groups, poor and proficient readers exhibited unique meta-cognitive profiles. Proficient and poor readers employ different meta-cognitive strategies, and poor readers benefit more from strategies than proficient readers.;"[Soto, Christian; Bernal, Macarena Andrea Carrasco; Castro, Marco Antonio Contreras] Univ Concepcion, Dept Spanish, Psycholinguist Area, Victor Lamas 1290, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [de Blume, Antonio P.

The indirect effect of contextual variables (Family, Teachers and Classmates) on the dependent variables thru school engagement. A sample of 1170 students of 12 to 17 years old was used. Two questionnaires are answered by every student to assess school engagement and contextual variables. Information about school performance and percentage of attendance to classes is provided by holders of municipal schools. School engagement is considered as conformed by three subtypes of engagements (affective, cognitive and behavioural). Structural equation modelling is performed to determine the fit of model to data. The mediation model proposed presented a good fit (RMSEA=.045; CFI =.944, TLI =.940). Cognitive engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on school performance. Affective engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on attendance to classes. School engagement is a variable to consider affecting the dependent variables school performance and attendance to classes. An important issue is that School engagement and contextual variables are modifiable aspects of a student life.

Admission tests are being increasingly demonized in many parts of the world and many colleges and universities are dropping tests for selection purposes, claiming the tests are detrimental to fair selection. The testing industry is at the center of this criticism and is accused of maintaining, and even facilitating, the social ills associated with admissions testing, much like iconic business corporations were accused of supporting unfair labor practices in the 1990s. The response of some business corporations to those criticisms was to embrace corporate social responsibility and increase transparency and accountability in their operations. Unfortunately, such acceptance of responsibility and increased transparency have not emerged in the testing industry. We believe the legitimacy of admission tests will continue to be challenged until the testing industry adopts a new way of conducting their business to regain the goodwill of relevant stakeholders in society that so far have been largely ignored.;"[Koljatic, Mladen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Silva, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile; [Sireci, Stephen G.] Ctr Educ Assessment, Amherst, MA USA";;Koljatic, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.;;;Sireci, Stephen/0000-0002-2174-8777;;;;41;14;14;9;15;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0731-1745;1745-3992;;EDUC MEAS-ISSUES PRA;Educ.

Specifically, we apply generalized additive modeling to consider three hypotheses regarding the functional form of these associations: (1) educators' content knowledge must reach a threshold before demonstrating associations with practice, (2) educators' knowledge is associated with practice until reaching a plateau, or (3) educators' knowledge is linearly associated with practice. We measured educators' (n = 437) content knowledge using an adaptation of the Moats (1994) knowledge survey, observed their classroom practices in the fall and spring of one academic year, and applied standardized coding schemes to code the latter with respect to the quality and quantity of emergent literacy practices. In general, results indicated positive, linear associations between educators' knowledge and classroom practices. We discuss findings relative to prior work and conjectures concerning these associations as characterized by thresholds or plateaus. We also discuss implications for future research, preservice educator preparation, and inservice professional development.;"[Piasta, Shayne B.; Farley, Kristin S.; Park, Somin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Piasta, Shayne B.; Farley, Kristin S.; Justice, Laura M.; Park, Somin] Ohio State Univ, Crane Ctr Early Childhood Res & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ramirez, Pamela Soto; Justice, Laura M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Educ Studies, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Farley, Kristin S.] Wittenberg Univ, Dept Educ, Springfield, OH 45501 USA; [Ramirez, Pamela Soto] Pontifica Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med, MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile";;"Piasta, SB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.; Piasta, SB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Crane Ctr Early Childhood Res & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.";piasta.1@osu.edu;;Park, Somin/0000-0002-8885-0872;;;;76;8;8;1;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0922-4777;1573-0905;;READ WRIT;Read.

A software application was developed and integrated into PowerPoint that makes it possible for the instructor to fill in empty graphic organizers during PowerPoint projection mode. The participants were 152 fourth-grade students selected from three schools that were grouped in four classrooms. Each classroom was divided in two groupsgraphic organizer and content-based. The graphic organizer group was taught using an 11-slide PowerPoint presentation on a social study topic that included two empty graphic organizers plus two additional slides explaining how to make a comparison. The content-based group was taught using the same presentation but without these additional slides plus a set of questions students had to answer as a class activity. The lessons were recorded and the verbal statements between instructor and students examined using the Flanders Interaction Analysis System. Results indicated significant differences in how instructors and students interacted in each group, including more questions asked by teachers (d = 1.99) and more students participating in the classroom discussion in the graphic organizer group (d = 1.76). Learning outcomes showed that the graphic organizer group outperformed the content-based group on a memory test (d = .45) and a comprehension test (d = .44). These results encourage the use of graphic organizers as an instructional approach, and are consistent with a generative theory of learning.;"[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Contabilidad & Auditoria, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Ingn Ind, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Loyola, Maria Soledad] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Lab Tecnol Interact VirtuaLab, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Contabilidad & Auditoria, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.;hector.ponce@usach.cl;Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;"Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945";"CONICYT (Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) of Chile [FONDECYT 1151092]; CORFO Grant [15VEIID-45646]; Proyectos Basales at University of Santiago of Chile";This study was partially funded by CONICYT (Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia) of Chile Grant FONDECYT 1151092, CORFO Grant 15VEIID-45646, and Proyectos Basales at University of Santiago of Chile.;;34;5;5;2;29;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0020-4277;1573-1952;;INSTR SCI;Instr.

This study explores the association between academic performance and students' perceptions of school coexistence from a multidimensional approach. The participants were 1016 Chilean students (49.9% girls, 50.1% boys; M=9.72, SD= .97 years). A structural equation model relating academic performance with the eight dimensions of coexistence considered in this study was performed. The model explains a 39.6% of the variability in school performance. We highlight the negative impact of levels of indiscipline, aggression, victimization, and teacher apathy on academic performance; and conversely, the positive and protective role of positive interpersonal management, normative adjustment, and peer social networks. The implications of these results for intervention in the school system are discussed from an individual and contextual perspective.

Universities offer more flexible curricula and put a lot of effort on the acquisition of professional engineering skills by the students. In many universities, the courses in the first years of different engineering degrees share program and objectives, having a large number of students and teachers. These common courses are expected to provide the students with meaningful learning experiences, which could be achieved by using active learning. The use of active learning in engineering courses improves traditional teaching by promoting students' participation and engagement, although active learning courses can be very sensitive to differences in learning paces or team conflicts; this being a challenge for the widespread adoption of active learning in courses with many students and teachers. This paper proposes a methodology that facilitates the detection and reaction to problems in active learning engineering courses with many students and teachers. This methodology is based on gathering feedback (from students and teachers) and decision-making processes at selected milestones. The methodology integrates intra-edition mechanisms in order to detect problems and react as the courses are being taught, and inter-edition mechanisms to ensure the persistence of necessary changes in the courses design. The methodology has been successfully applied during four consecutive editions to improve an undergraduate active learning programming course with an average of 257 students and 9 teachers per edition. An extended validation of expert educators suggests that this methodology can also be applied to traditional engineering courses.";"[Estevez-Ayres, Iria; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Crespo-Garcia, Raquel M.; Leony, Derick; Delgado-Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Pardo, Abelardo] Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Parada G, Hugo A.] Univ Politecn Madrid, COM, Madrid 28223, Spain";;Estevez-Ayres, I (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Ave Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.;ayres@it.uc3m.es;"Pérez-Sanangustín, Mar/G-8981-2015; Pardo, Abelardo/C-3001-2011; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Parada G., Hugo A./AAE-5063-2022; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; García, Raquel M Crespo/F-9614-2011; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/G-4730-2011; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Parada G., Hugo A./AAE-3545-2022; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"Pardo, Abelardo/0000-0002-6857-0582; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Parada G., Hugo A./0000-0003-3714-7906; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; García, Raquel M Crespo/0000-0002-1014-9576; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/0000-0002-1047-5398; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Parada G., Hugo A./0000-0003-3714-7906; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness EEE project [TIN2011-28308-C03-01]; Regional Government of Madrid eMadrid project [S2009/TIC-1650]; postdoctoral fellowship Alianza 4 Universidades";This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness EEE project TIN2011-28308-C03-01, the Regional Government of Madrid eMadrid project S2009/TIC-1650, and the postdoctoral fellowship Alianza 4 Universidades.;;42;16;16;1;39;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

Trained in different design education systems, these professionals can have different conceptual understandings about design. Recognizing and identifying these differences are key issues for establishing shared design practices within the educational community. Contributing to this understanding, we examined whether and how two different populations of students have different knowledge structures with respect to HCI design. We adopted the romantic, conservative and pragmatic dimensions, previously investigated in the related research, to elucidate those differences. This paper compares one specific type of design artefact-conceptual frameworks-created by groups of students with different educational backgrounds: Arts and Engineering. It was based on a set of 22 criteria divided by two main domains: scheme (addressing form) and realm (focusing on contents). The obtained results show that students with background in Engineering (1) focus more on the product of design; (2) rely less on conceptual frameworks to guide the design process; and (3) produce artefacts that are more constrained in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, definition of a symbolic system, and information organization and shaping. We suggest that conceptual frameworks serve to communicate and understand design practice. We note that Engineering students seem to be more susceptible to fixation than Arts students and suggest that an emphasis of reflection-in-action could help compensating this problem.";"[Antunes, Pedro] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Xiao, Lu] Univ Western Ontario, Fac Informat & Media Studies, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Pino, Jose A.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;Antunes, P (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.;"pedro.antunes@vuw.ac.nz; lxiao24@uwo.ca; jpino@dcc.uchile.cl";"Pino, Jose/G-6404-2016; Antunes, Pedro A/B-8664-2008; Xiao, Lu/O-8014-2016";"Pino, Jose/0000-0002-8466-6453; Antunes, Pedro A/0000-0002-5411-8798; Xiao, Lu/0000-0001-5420-1578";;;;32;5;5;1;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

Our main prediction was that the RAN-reading relationship would decrease due to a gradual change in reading strategy, from serial decoding to sight word reading. Therefore, in contrast to most previous studies, we used discrete reading tasks. Serial RAN tasks for objects, colors, digits, and letters were included. First, we examined whether the RAN tasks loaded on the same constructs across time. An alphanumeric and a nonalphanumeric factor were identified, which were invariant over time. In subsequent multigroup structural equation models we found that the PA-reading relationship was low but slightly increased in the higher grades. As predicted, the RAN-reading relationship decreased for words, whereas the relationship remained stable for pseudowords.;"[Rodriguez, Cristina; van den Boer, Madelon; de Jong, Peter F.] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rodriguez, Cristina] Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Concepcion, Chile; [Jimenez, Juan E.] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain";;Rodriguez, C (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Fac Educ, Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.;crodri@ull.es;"Jiménez, Juan E/AAI-6198-2021; Jiménez, Juan E/A-6057-2008; Rodríguez, Cristina/H-1021-2015";"Jiménez, Juan E/0000-0002-7466-8340; Jiménez, Juan E/0000-0002-7466-8340; Rodríguez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767";"National Plan I+D+i [1FD97-1140]; FEDEREuropean Commission; Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society [GRUP2004/13]; Spanish Ministry of Education, through the National Human Resources Mobility of National I+D+i";This study was supported by grants (1FD97-1140) of the National Plan I+D+i, co-financed with FEDER, and (GRUP2004/13) of Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society of which PI was the third author.

We examined whether students' writing quality differed when writing journals on a weekly basis for 12 weeks, compared with a control group. Three covariates were analyzed, namely: (i) the students' attitudes towards writing; (ii) their self-efficacy in writing; (iii) and their use of self-regulation (SRL) strategies while writing. Findings have shown that students who wrote week-journals significantly improved the writing quality of their compositions and reported a higher use of SRL strategies in writing. Nevertheless, self-efficacy and attitude towards writing were found to not be related to the quality of the compositions. Moreover, data indicated that the writing quality of compositions improved along with the writing quality of the week-journals.

This study aimed to assess the mitigating effect of adult figures support (at school and home) on the relationship between bullying victimization and life satisfaction experienced by adolescents. To this end, a sample of 5774 adolescents from 71 public schools located throughout the violent neighborhoods of Lima (Peril) was evaluated. A moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderating role of support adult figures from home and school. The results show that the support of adults at home and school mitigate the negative effect of bullying victimization on life satisfaction, and this effect is larger in the case of adult home support. Adult support at home and school help students with high prevalence of bullying victimization maintain high levels of life satisfaction compared to adolescents with low support from adults. Finally, the need for adults at school and home to take joint measures to prevent and reduce the prevalence of this type of peer violence is discussed. (C) 2018 Universidad de Pais Vasco.

However, evidence for causal relations between spatial skills and STEM performance remains scarce. In this study, we test the extent to which mechanical problem solving, a spatially demanding STEM activity, facilitates spatial performance. Participants (N = 180) were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions: mechanical reasoning with a hands-on component; mechanical reasoning without a hands-on component; an active control condition involving spatial training with cross-sectioning; and an active control group involving a reading exercise. All participants were tested immediately before, after, and one-week following training. Both mechanical conditions were associated with enhanced spatial visualization performance, an effect that was similar for both conditions and remained stable across immediate and delayed post-tests.

(b) Do these maternal practices mediate the relation between maternal education and these child outcomes? Confirming previous studies, exposure to texts and non-present talk predicted vocabulary, and teaching practices predicted child code-related skills. Contrary to previous studies, exposure to texts also predicted child code-related skills. We also found that maternal practices partially mediated the relation between maternal education and early literacy skills. Practice or Policy: Findings suggest the need to target children before prekindergarten with interventions that increase the studied maternal practices and to do so in family, day care, and health care settings with special emphasis on families with incomplete elementary education. The broad effect of exposure to texts on early literacy outcomes and the low social value on reading in Chilean culture suggest that teacher preparation programs need to include ways to engage children in literature as a frequent experience.;"[Mendive, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Lissi, Maria Rosa; Reyes, Adriana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Bakeman, Roger] Georgia State Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA";;Mendive, S (corresponding author), Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;smendive@uc.cl;Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017;"Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Lissi, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-9740-6853";"Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago, Chile; Harvard Graduate School of Education; Harvard Center on the Developing Child; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University; UNICEF's Chile country office; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140637]; Chilean National Science and Technology Fund";The primary funder of this project was the Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago, Chile.

First, the Magellan-Leiden Childcare Study (MLCS) used a sample of 95 mothers with children younger than 1year old (n=36 in day care). Second, we partially cross-validated our results in a large and representative sample of 10,723 mothers and their children from the Chilean Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia (Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey). In both studies, the quality of care for children provided at home was measured with the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. In the MLCS study, additional indicators of the mother-child relationship were measured. Day care was not negatively associated with the mother-child relationship and maternal sensitivity, compared to maternal care, or with the quality of the home environment. Positive changes in attachment security were found in Mapuche children who attended day care centers.

Forty mother-child dyads recorded their naturalistic exchanges in their homes using an enhanced audio-recording device (the Language ENvironment Analysis System). Results from a sample of naturalistic interactions during mealtimes indicated that all mothers involved their children in a variety of math exchanges, although there were differences in the amount of math input that children received. Moreover, being exposed to more instances of math talk was positively related to children's early mathematical ability a year after the recordings, even after we controlled for maternal education, self-regulation, and recorded minutes. Practice or Policy: These findings improve the understanding of how mothers use math with their preschool children in naturalistic contexts, providing some insight for parents into how to foster children's math skills through verbal input in their normal routines. Moreover, these findings inform kindergarten teachers and practitioners about the math input that children receive at home, which may encourage them to adapt their practice by considering the home environment.;"[Susperreguy, Maria Ines] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Davis-Kean, Pamela E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";;Susperreguy, MI (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;misusper@uc.cl;"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015";"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Davis-Kean, Pamela/0000-0001-8389-6268";;;;54;52;53;7;48;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-9289;1556-6935;;EARLY EDUC DEV;Early Educ.

Two predominant hypotheses have been developed in this regard: 1) difficulties in arithmetic appear due to a deficit in domain-specific skills (numerical skills) and 2) there is a strong relationship between the development of the domain-general processes and arithmetical skills. In this study we explore the specific contribution of orienting and executive control attentional networks to individual variability in basic mental arithmetic. Participants were elementary school children, from second to third grade, with and without difficulties in basic mental arithmetic. Results provide support for the two proposed hypotheses. Children with difficulties in arithmetic showed difficulties both in numerical skills and in attentional networks. These findings suggest that arithmetic difficulties may be associated with a heterogeneous combination of deficits, including difficulties in attentional functioning.;"[Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile; [Kettlun Poblete, Rocio] Univ Desarrollo, Concepcion, Bio Bio, Chile; [Estevez Perez, Nancy] Ctr Neurociencias Cuba, Dept Neurodesarrollo Infantil, Havana, Cuba";;"Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.; Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile.";danilka.castro@umayor.cl;;;"National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF) [ID18I10002]";Funding: This research was funded by two grants from the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence (Grant FB0003), and The Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF, Grant ID18I10002).

Coexistence, as a model based on the mutual integration of locals and migrants, is still a challenge to face in Europe and Spain. This study aims to identify which mental health and resilience variables influence school integration used as a proxy for psychosocial well-being by comparing a sample of migrant and local adolescents. Through a quantitative methodology, school factors, disruptive behaviors, and resilience were measured in 132 students aged between 12 and 18 years old. The results reveal that although mental health scores are similar in both groups, mental health and contextual resilience are more critical for the migrant adolescent population than for the local one. Clearly identifying the relationships between school related factors and mental health offers the possibility of designing effective interventions within the educational context.;"[Morales, Nadia; Ramos, Mar; Felt, Emily; Collazos, Francisco] Hosp Univ Vall Hebron, Barcelona, Spain; [Contreras, Camila] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Chavez, David] Univ Austral Chile, Puerto Montt, Chile";;Chavez, D (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Puerto Montt, Chile.;dchavez.herting@gmail.com;Chávez, David/AAT-4412-2020;Chávez, David/0000-0003-4700-0588;;;;32;0;0;3;6;COLEGIO OFICIAL PSICOLOGOS MADRID;MADRID;C/CUESTA SAN VICENTE, NO 4, 6 PLANTA, MADRID, 28008, SPAIN;1135-755X;2174-0526;;PSICOL EDUC;Psicol.

A sample of 19 urban schools and 498 students were used for the study. Research Findings: The data analysis showed statistical differences in the results of students from low SES schools compared with medium and high SES schools in four symbolic number tasks: counting fluency, oral number identification, oral number comparison, and non-oral number comparison. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a direct contribution of school vulnerability index, non-symbolic number tasks, and symbolic number tasks in number comparison performance. These analyses also revealed that school vulnerability index made a loose predictive contribution when symbolic number tasks were introduced into the model. Practice or Policy: The achievement gap detected in the early stages of formal education will most likely increase with time. Early detection of mathematics learning difficulties, effective intervention, and training of teaching staff may be means of equalizing the performance of students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.;"[Sepulveda, Felipe; Rodriguez, Cristina; Peake, Christian] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Sepulveda, Felipe; Peake, Christian] CIEDE UCSC, Ctr Invest Educ & Desarrollo, Concepcion, Chile; [Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ La Laguna, Fac Psicol, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain";;Sepulveda, F (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Campus San Andres,Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.;fsepulveda@ucsc.cl;"Sepúlveda, Felipe/AAH-3830-2019; Sepulveda, Felipe/G-3398-2017; Rodríguez, Cristina/H-1021-2015; Peake, Christian/F-2282-2016";"Sepúlveda, Felipe/0000-0001-5703-383X; Sepulveda, Felipe/0000-0001-5703-383X; Rodríguez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767; Peake, Christian/0000-0002-7127-6501";"CONICYT, FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1161213]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Programa Ramon y Cajal [RYC-2014-16948]";"This study was supported by CONICYT, FONDECYT REGULAR 1161213; and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Programa Ramon y Cajal, RYC-2014-16948.";;79;5;5;2;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1040-9289;1556-6935;;EARLY EDUC DEV;Early Educ.

Children, fathers, and mothers exhibited stereotypes that link math with males. More specifically, mothers identified more with language than with math, while fathers and children identified more with math than with language. Path analyses models revealed that children's explicit math self-concepts significantly predicted their actual math achievement. Children's explicit self-concept was, in turn, explained marginally by the mathematical anxiety of their mothers.Practice or Policy: These results contribute to our understanding of the relation between parental and children's beliefs and children's math achievement during early elementary school years. In countries such as Chile, with a significant gender gap in math achievement, these findings may highlight relevant aspects to consider when designing interventions aimed at educational equity and providing equal mathematical learning opportunities to boys and girls.;"[del Rio, M.

Two moderators were examined, namely, children's initial skill level and teachers' classroom organization during an interactive read-aloud session. In keeping with prior research, interactive book reading quality, measured by examination of teachers' extratextual talk, was positively and significantly related to children's development of both language and literacy skills. Interactive book reading quality was not significantly moderated by children's initial skills, with the exception that interactive book reading quality appeared most beneficial to children's print knowledge for children entering prekindergarten with relatively low skill. The unique contribution of this study is that the association between interactive book reading quality and children's expressive vocabulary was dependent on an organized classroom during the book reading session. Practice or Policy: The quality of teachers' talk during interactive book reading may matter for children's vocabulary development only when reading sessions are characterized by relatively high classroom organization. Classroom organization should be an important consideration while planning for interactive book reading sessions.;"[Cabell, Sonia Q.] Florida State Univ, Sch Teacher Educ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Cabell, Sonia Q.] Florida State Univ, Florida Ctr Reading Res, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Zucker, Tricia A.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, McGovern Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [DeCoster, Jamie; Hamre, Bridget] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Ctr Adv Study Teaching & Learning, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Melo, Carolina] Univ Los Andes, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Forston, Lindsay] Communites Sch Virginia, Arlington, VA USA";;Cabell, SQ (corresponding author), Florida Ctr Reading Res, 2010 Levy Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.;scabell@fcrr.org;"DeCoster, Jamie/ABB-7592-2021; Melo, Carolina/AAB-4282-2020";Melo-Hurtado, Carolina/0000-0003-2297-6357;U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education SciencesUS Department of Education [R305A060021];The research reported here was supported by the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, through Grant No. R305A060021 to the University of Virginia funding the National Center for Research on Early Childhood Education, principal investigator Dr. Robert Pianta.

The first class (one 80-minute session) in an introductory computer science course may be an appropriate instance to combat such a belief. Previous studies have used coursewide interventions, e.g., games and physical/tangible devices to improve students' motivation. However, although other approaches help motivate students, they may lack real-world context or have a high cost of deployment. This article proposes a novel real-world based approach to introduce programming concepts in the first class of the introductory computer science course. This approach, called Protobject based, is applicable to courses with over 100 students, has a low deployment entry barrier, requires low investment, and may be used creatively to implement different experiences. Furthermore, the Protobject-based approach has an equivalent motivational effect-at least in the short-term-to a Game-based approach even if it is entirely focused on the real world. The low requirements of the approach make it especially suitable for an 80-minute first class in an introductory computer science course. The Protobject-based approach has been preliminarily validated and compared to a pure game-based approach with a study with 376 participants, and we present the analysis of motivation questionnaires, a pre-test and post-test, and a homework assignment given to the students. We posit that more research into initiatives such as this one-that can show students how computer science can impact the real world around them-is warranted.;"[Bellino, Alessio] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat & Telecomunicac, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Herskovic, Valeria; Hund, Michael; Munoz-Gama, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Bellino, A (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat & Telecomunicac, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.;"alessio.bellino@udp.cl; vherskov@ing.puc.cl; mahund@uc.cl; jmun@uc.cl";;BELLINO, ALESSIO/0000-0003-0285-1549;"CONICYT/FONDECYT (Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181162]; Departamento de Ciencia de la Computacion UC/Fond [DCC 2017-0001]";This work was supported in part by: CONICYT/FONDECYT (Chile) grant 1181162, Engineering Postdoc UC 2018, and by the Departamento de Ciencia de la Computacion UC/Fond-DCC 2017-0001.;;49;0;0;0;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1946-6226;;;ACM T COMPUT EDUC;ACM Trans.

Chile is not an exception in this global trend. Although Chile has significantly expanded early education coverage for children from low-income backgrounds, there has been little research to assess the effects these programs have had in improving academic outcomes. Responding to this need, this study assesses the impact of Chile's public early childhood education programs on fourth-grade academic achievement (as measured by the country's national Education Quality Measurement System, SIMCE). Our results indicate that, after controlling for socio-demographic factors potentially associated with choosing to participate in an ECCE program or not, ECCE is positively associated with academic gains on all three SIMCE tests: mathematics, reading, and social sciences. Chilean children who participated in public ECCE programs scored on average 0.23 Standard Deviations (SD) higher in math, 0.19 SD higher in reading, and 0.19 SD higher in social sciences than children who did not attend an ECCE program before entering Kindergarten. However, our findings suggest that not all children benefit equally from attending ECCE. Results show that boys benefit academically significantly more than girls, and that the ECCE effect on academic achievement also differs depending on the Socioeconomic Status (SES) of the families, with children from middle-low SES groups benefiting the most.

The Mapuches comprise the main Indigenous group in Chile and a socioeconomically vulnerable group. We studied the differences in cognitive development between these two groups, focusing on the role of the families' socioeconomic resources and the parental behaviors. We use data from the 2012 Encuesta Longitudinal de Primera Infancia, a nationally representative survey of early childhood (0-6 years old) in Chile, which includes a test of cognitive development validated for Mapuche preschoolers. Our results indicate that the cognitive gap between Mapuche children and non Indigenous children in Chile starts before they enter primary school (SD = 0.2, p < 0.001), which coincides with the lower limit of the gap found in previous studies during school years. In linear models of cognitive development, socioeconomic resources, and parental behaviors account for part of the gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children, but not for all of it. We also find a positive interaction between a Mapuche origin and home learning materials, which indicates that Mapuche children benefit from a rich learning environment at home more intensively than do non-Indigenous Chilean children.

Anatomy laboratories have been replacing formaldehyde with solutions that retain the characteristics of fresh tissue. For this purpose, alternative solutions with a very low concentration of formaldehyde or without any formaldehyde have been analyzed. The objective of this study was to compare biometry, coloration, haptic properties, and bacterial load on animal specimens (pig kidneys) embalmed with formaldehyde, and with Chilean Conservative Fixative Solution with and without formaldehyde (formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS). Also, the perception of health and biological science students toward specimens treated with different solutions was assessed. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in specimens' retraction, or bacterial load. Students showed a preference for organs embalmed in formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS; indicating that with these treatments they could better visualize structures and that the prosections had greater flexibility and the colors were more similar to those of fresh tissue. Additionally, students recommended the material embalmed in formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS for anatomy learning. In contrast, students indicated that formaldehyde-fixation negatively affected their practical experience. In conclusion, embalming with formaldehyde chCFS or formaldehyde-free chCFS provides an advantageous practical experience over the use of formaldehyde and may be an alternative to replace the use of formaldehyde in anatomy laboratories.";"[Skopnik-Chicago, Marianne; Poblete-Cordero, Katherine; Lizana, Pablo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Morphol Sci, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Zamora, Natali; Bastias, Roberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Microbiol, Valparaiso, Chile";;Lizana, PA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Morphol Sci, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;pablo.lizana@pucv.cl;Bastías, Roberto/AAW-7522-2021;"Bastías, Roberto/0000-0003-4819-6148; Lizana, Pablo A./0000-0002-9366-6930";;;;72;1;1;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1935-9772;1935-9780;;ANAT SCI EDUC;Anat.

In the case of parenting, maternal reflective function unfolds within child-caregiver interactions, and previous studies have pointed out this variable as necessary for positive care. In the present study we sought to understand how high levels of stress could interfere with their reflective function capacity, and how this relates to children's ToM. A sample of 125 mothers and their preschool children (36-54 months) was assessed. It was hypothesized that the maternal reflective function would play a mediating role between the parental stress variable and the preschooler's ToM. The study found that parental stress exerted direct and significant effects on the mother's reflective function and direct but mild effects on the child's ToM. In addition, different elements of parental stress would act differently on the mother's reflective function.;"[Cowes, Ely Ann; Santelices, Maria Pia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Santelices, MP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Sch Psychol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;;;;"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130786]; Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) through the Millennium Institute for Research on Depression and Personality-MIDAP [IS130005]";This paper was prepared with support from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYT [grant number 1130786], and Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) through the Millennium Institute for Research on Depression and Personality-MIDAP [grant number IS130005].;;37;0;0;3;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0300-4430;1476-8275;;EARLY CHILD DEV CARE;Early Child Dev.

Nevertheless, the transactional model of development (Sameroff, 2010) suggests that the relationship might run the other way as well. This research examined how children's reading interest (as reported by their parents) and parents' literacy practices remain stable or change over time, as well as cross-lagged relationships between reading interest and parents' literacy practices from the beginning of prekindergarten to the end of kindergarten. The 721 participants were drawn from low-SES Chilean families participating in a larger study. The results show that in these low-income Chilean families, it is more likely for reading interest to predict parents' practices than the other way around. Results suggest that interventions designed to improve the home literacy environment could be attained through improving parents' perceptions of children's reading interest rather than seeking only to change parents' practices directly.

The goal of the present study was to explore and describe gifted students' perceptions of their first year after high school regarding experiences of success and failure. Two focus groups were conducted with 12 students (8 males, 4 females) from different educational backgrounds, who had participated in a university-based enrichment program, to discuss topics related to their academic and socio-emotional experiences at a postsecondary level. Many students who attended vocational high schools experienced high levels of discomfort with their academic preparedness to face postsecondary education. Other initial problems were adapting socially to a new environment and perceiving themselves as less gifted than their peers. However, after these initial adjustment problems, students revealed high perseverance to face difficulties and a strong motivation for continuing the academic path they had outlined for themselves.

There are currently two competing positions: one that sustains that giftedness is by itself a risk factor for social adaptation, and another that holds that high cognitive abilities involve distinctive features that are protective and hence increase individual resilience. Empirical support has been provided for both positions. This paper provides data from a study performed with 50 Spanish-speaking gifted children and adolescents using a comparison group of 50 average-ability peers matched by sex and chronological age. The results show no significant differences between gifted students and their peers on global measures of adjustment. Instead, they suggest that gifted students are neither significantly more poorly nor better adjusted than their peers during different age periods.

The sample consisted of 268 children, 144 in the intervention group and 124 in the comparison group. The computer-based intervention comprised 16 sessions of 30min each. Children in the intervention group demonstrated significantly more progress in WM than those in the comparison group when we evaluated them 3 months after exposure to the program and controlled for initial differences with an analysis of covariance. ELS were significantly stronger in children who were exposed to the stimulation program, which supports a link between WM and ELS.

Elements of coherence were assessed in both tasks, namely problem, resolution, and mental-states. The findings indicate that questions can scaffold the production of more coherent narratives. Narratives elicited after questions were judged to be more coherent than those produced before the question-answering task.

Participants were 390 Chilean preschool children and their parents. Children completed numeracy and literacy tasks at the beginning of preschool (mean age: 4 years and 7 months) and approximately 8 months later. Parents reported on the home numeracy activities they engaged in with their children, including formal (i.e., mapping and operational), informal (i.e., parents' number-game knowledge), and home literacy activities (i.e., code-related and meaning-related), as well as on numeracy and literacy attitudes and expectations for children's performance prior to Grade 1. We found that parents with more positive numeracy attitudes and higher academic expectations reported a higher frequency of formal numeracy (mapping and operational) activities. In turn, formal operational activities predicted number line estimation and applied problem-solving skills. In contrast, informal activities (i.e., parents' numbergame knowledge) predicted children's non-symbolic arithmetic and non-symbolic number comparison tasks, as well as their applied problem-solving skills. The links between home activities and numeracy outcomes were domain specific: Parents' reports of literacy activities did not predict early numeracy skills. We discuss how our results support the enhanced Home Numeracy Model and thus provide a more complete framework connecting parents' engagement in numeracy activities and children's mathematical outcomes.

HOTT is less frequent in lower-income children and children with brain injuries, but effects differed depending on HOTT complexity and type of brain injury. Controlling for income, children with larger and later-occurring cerebrovascular infarcts produce fewer surface (where relations are more perceptual) and structure (where relations are more abstract) HOTT utterances than TD children. In contrast, children with smaller and earlier occurring periventricular lesions produce HOTT at comparable rates to TD children. This suggests that examining HOTT development may be an important tool for understanding the impacts of brain injury in children. Theoretically, these data reveal that both neurological (size and timing of brain injury) and environmental (family income) factors contribute to these skills.;"[Frausel, Rebecca R.; Vollman, Elayne; Goldin-Meadow, Susan; Levine, Susan C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Comparat Human Dev, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Muzard, Antonia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Richland, Lindsey E.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, Irvine, CA USA";;Frausel, RR (corresponding author), Penn State Erie, Behrend Coll, Susan Hirt Hagen Ctr Community Outreach Res & Eva, Erie, PA 16563 USA.;rrf5129@psu.edu;;"Richland, Lindsey/0000-0003-1514-6013; Frausel, Rebecca/0000-0002-2584-263X";;;;51;0;0;2;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1751-2271;1751-228X;;MIND BRAIN EDUC;Mind Brain Educ.;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1111/mbe.12301;;OCT 2021;14;"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Developmental";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; Psychology";WB3OO;WOS:000703485200001;;;;;2022-04-06;

This study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, executive functions (EFs), quality of the home environment, quantity of maternal care, and quality and quantity of professional childcare as predictors of five-year-old preschoolers' problem behavior, prosocial behavior, and language ability in 77 low-SES families with a Chilean majority or Mapuche minority background in Chile. Executive functions and the quality of the home environment were positively associated with language ability, whereas quantity of childcare was inversely related to children's language ability. All other associations were non-significant. The results corroborate the vital roles of child executive functioning and stimulating and responsive parenting in child language ability in a Latin-American context. Furthermore, our findings revealed inadequate preschool classroom quality and provide new evidence from southern Chile of the urgent need to improve the quality of Chilean children's preprimary education as a catalyst for reducing social disparities.

However, few studies have described how different infant care experiences may relate to later child cognitive, language and motor functioning, and most analyses have focused on samples from historically industrialized regions. Cognitive, language and motor subscores (TEPSI) and receptive vocabulary scores (TVIP) obtained through direct testing of 24-to-48-month-old children (n = 7564) from the Chilean Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood were compared based on retrospective reports of care received as infants. Children who, as infants, had received one of four types of non-maternal care - center-based, grandparent, other relative, and non-relative care - were compared to those who had exclusively experienced maternal care (71.8%). Series of regressions with propensity score models (PSM) were performed. Compared to maternal care, children in center-based care and grandparent care had higher total TEPSI scores (d = .19, p < 0.05) (d = .19, p < 0.01) and TEPSI language subscores (d = .20, p < 0.05) (d = .20, p < 0.01), while those in grandparent care also had higher TEPSI motor subscores (d=.08, p < 0.05). In contrast, children in nonrelative care had lower TVIP receptive vocabulary scores (d= -.38, p < 0.01). These findings contribute to the debate on national policies supporting specific types of non-maternal care and their impact on child development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the unique contributions of these components to distinctive early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool children. Moreover, most studies have not considered the covariance between these early academic skills in preschool-aged children. The present study examined whether there are differential contributions of visual-spatial and verbal short-term memory, working memory, and response inhibition to specific early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool-aged children, taking into account the covariance among these outcomes. Several seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analyses were conducted with 419 Chilean preschool aged children (M = 53.9 months; SD = 4.22). The results show that both response inhibition and verbal short-term memory uniquely predicted all academic outcomes; working memory predicted all early academic skills (with the exception of verbal counting); and visual-spatial short-term memory predicted all numeracy skills and receptive vocabulary. When comparing the marginal effects of the EFs on the outcomes, response inhibition more strongly predicted applied problems than did working memory. Both visual-spatial short-term memory and response inhibition had a greater effect on explaining applied problems, compared to early decoding skills. Implications for teachers and interventions are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have examined various dimensions of the preschool classroom language environment, including linguistic responsivity of early childhood educators, data-providing features of teachers' talk, and characteristics of the systems-level general environment, but no study has examined the unique contribution of each dimension to children's language growth over time. The goals of this study were to determine how best to represent the dimensionality of the preschool classroom's linguistic environment and to determine which dimensions are most strongly associated with children's language development. Participants were teachers in 49 preschool classrooms and a random sample of children from each classroom (330 children between 40 and 60 months of age, M = 52 months, SD = 5.5). Children's grammar and vocabulary skills were measured at three time-points, and the classroom linguistic environment was assessed with measures representing teachers' linguistic responsivity, data-providing features of teachers' talk, and systems-level general quality. Using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), we determined that the classroom language environment is best characterized by a three-dimensional model. A multilevel latent growth model subsequently showed that only one of the three dimensions, teachers' communication-facilitating behaviors, predicted growth in children's vocabulary from preschool to kindergarten.

This study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, maternal self-competence, parental cognitive stimulation, and maternal supportive discipline as predictors of five-year-old preschoolers' school readiness and executive function abilities in 70 families of low-SES homes with a Chilean majority or indigenous Mapuche minority background in Chile. Additionally, the mediating role of parental beliefs and parenting practices between SES and school readiness or executive functioning respectively was investigated as suggested by the Family Stress Model. Results show that maternal supportive discipline predicted school readiness above and beyond SES and ethnicity. Furthermore, maternal supportive discipline mediated the relation between SES and school readiness, whereby higher SES positively affected maternal supportive discipline, which in turn had a favorable effect on school readiness. All other associations were non-significant. The outcomes highlight that parental involvement of culturally diverse families from low-SES backgrounds is important for children's cognitive development. School readiness of Chilean preschoolers from low-SES homes might possibly be improved by enhancing maternal sensitivity and positive behavioral control strategies. These parenting skills have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of low-SES environments to some extent.

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.;"[Marin, B.; Frez, J.] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Cruz-Lemus, J.; Genero, M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Paseo Univ 4, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain";;Marin, B (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.;"beatriz.marin@mail.udp.cl; jonathan.frez@mail.udp.cl; JoseAntonio.Cruz@uclm.es; Marcela.Genero@uclm.es";"Marín, Beatriz/Z-5032-2019; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./B-7299-2015";"Marín, Beatriz/0000-0001-8025-0023; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./0000-0002-0470-609X";"CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [REDI170020]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R]; Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM";This work has been developed within the ENSE Project (REDI170020) funded by CONICYT, the SEQUOIA Project, (TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R) (MINECO/FEDER) funded by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, and the GEMA project funded by Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM.;;45;21;21;6;39;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1946-6226;;;ACM T COMPUT EDUC;ACM Trans.

The focus of our inquiry is on Chile, one of the most economically unequal coun-tries in the world. We use data from the Longitudinal Early Childhood Survey conducted in 2010 and 2012, which contains information regarding infants aged 30 months on average ( n = 8,251). Early child-hood stimulation is examined using a multidimensional index that comprises three domains: caregivers' stimulation of cognitive-language, sensorimotor, and socio-emotional development. Our dynamic models show that the main factors that lead to less stimulation are low caregiver education, low-income house-holds, and large families. Specifically, it was found that an additional child being born within a two-year period decreases stimulation, indicating possible competition between siblings due to time and resource restrictions in the household. Furthermore, caregivers' performance in personality (BFI) and linguistic in-telligence (WAIS language) tests was found to be a more significant factor than operational memory. Taken together, these findings suggest the need for initiatives aimed at increasing equality in early child-hood stimulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Past studies have indicated that even if teachers show interest in cognitive neuroscience, they show high rates of adhesion to neuromyths. In the most commonly used questionnaire, however, respondents do not compare neuromyths and correct information based on neuroscience. The present study proposes a multiple-choice questionnaire that presents scenarios occurring in school. The most commonly used and the new questionnaire were administered to 174 Italian teachers. In the most commonly used questionnaire, teachers generally had the same likelihood of accepting neuromyths as the literature reports. In the new questionnaire, the levels of both general knowledge and beliefs about neuromyths were significantly lower. Moreover, it suggests that teachers' adhesion to neuromyths in realistic situations does not match their explicit beliefs. Thus, the present research proposes that the use of questions based on feasible scenarios is a useful method to assess neuromyths.;"[Tovazzi, Alice] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Dorsoduro 3434-D, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Giovannini, Serena; Basso, Demis] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Educ, Cognit & Educ Sci Lab CESLab, Viale Ratisbona 16, Bressanone Brixen, Italy; [Basso, Demis] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Neuropsicol & Neurociencias Cognit, Talca, Chile";;Tovazzi, A (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Dorsoduro 3434-D, I-30123 Venice, Italy.;alice.tovazzi@unive.it;Basso, Demis/Q-4782-2017;Basso, Demis/0000-0002-4595-3513;;;;35;5;5;1;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1751-2271;1751-228X;;MIND BRAIN EDUC;Mind Brain Educ.;MAY;2020;14;2;;;SI;;187;198;;10.1111/mbe.12249;;;12;"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Developmental";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Education & Educational Research; Psychology";LY8YO;WOS:000540815600012;;;;;2022-04-06;

The elements that mostly affect that perception are the curricular contents, teaching methodologies, and the handling of the education atmosphere. These elements, complex and dynamic, are perceived differently according to the level of the career. Some studies establish that the perception improves as the student progresses in the career, while others show the opposite. Objectives: Measure the perception of nursing students of the education atmosphere and compare the differences among the distinct levels of the career. Design: This was a longitudinal prospective study. Settings and Participants The study was conducted with nursing students from the class of 2011 at Universidad de los Andes, Santiago-Chile. Sixty-one students complied with inclusion criteria and were surveyed in second (n = 55), third (n = 51), and fourth (n = 34) years, during 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Methods: The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure questionnaire was applied. The STATA 10 program was used for analysis and the one way ANOVA was use to compare the results. Results: The average perception of the education atmosphere was 133/200, obtaining more positive aspects than negative ones. Students improve their perception as they advance in the career. The three measurements repeat five items as weaknesses and 12 as strengths. Conclusions: It is convenient to bear in mind the difficulties of students to reconcile the clinical experiences with the theoretical classes on campus by continuous assessing the academic load and the demands made by each professor. Some strategies would include promoting professors' greater closeness with the students, considering travel times in the academic programming, as well as applying the basic theoretical contents in real clinical cases to give them relevance.

Methods: Students in the sample are stratified by performance, with the experimental group (49 students) being exposed to self-instruction and clinical simulation on the topic of standard precautions and special precautions according to disease transmission mechanisms. Conventional classes on the same topics were provided to the control group (49 students). Results: The experimental group showed the best performance in the multiple-choice post-test of knowledge (p = 0.002) and in the assessment of essay questions (p = 0.043), as well as in the evaluation of a simulated scenario, in relation to the control group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is possible to transfer some teaching subjects on the prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) to self-learning by means of virtual teaching strategies with good results. This allows greater efficiency in the allocation of teachers to clinical simulation or learning situations in the laboratory, where students can apply what they have learned in the self-instruction module.;[Kappes Ramirez, Maria Soledad] San Sebastian Univ, Sch Nursing, Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5501842, Chile;;Ramirez, MSK (corresponding author), San Sebastian Univ, Sch Nursing, Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5501842, Chile.;maria.kappes@uss.cl;Kappes, Maria/AAC-6029-2020;Kappes, Maria/0000-0001-8101-3898;;;;33;3;4;1;13;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

Nursing students may commit errors during clinical practice, compromising patient safety. Objective: Analyze the adverse events, as well as the factors associated with the errors, reported by students from a private university in Santiago, Chile during nursing clinical rotations. Methods: Quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study. A total of 68 errors by first- through fifth-year nursing students were reported between 2012 and 2018. The data collection instrument was the Adverse Events Notification Form from the School of Nursing. This form documented information about the study as well as about the event. Results: After this reporting system was established in 2012, the number of events reported increased steadily each year. The greatest numbers of reported errors were committed by fifth-year students (73.5%), and the most common type of error was associated with medication administration (94.2%), including incorrect dose (27.9%) and incorrect medication (17.6%). The major factors contributing to errors were failure to review the 10 rights of medication administration (85.3%) or lack of critical judgment (7.4%). Most of the errors occurred in public institutions (72.1%). Conclusion: The results suggest that it would be beneficial to re-evaluate how safety and quality of care are taught at the school of nursing, with an emphasis on understanding the learning styles of students and teaching strategies of instructors. It Is crucial that the academic institution remain actively involved in teaching safety-related skills to future nursing professionals. Furthermore, we suggest modifications to the adverse events reporting system that would avoid the need for personal interpretations of the event by the student.;"[Echeverria Bickel, Araceli; Ximena Villasecas, Vargas; Javiera Fluxa, Parro] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile";;Bickel, AE (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile.;"aracelie@uandes.cl; xivargasv@uandes.cl; jfparro@uandes.cl";;;;;;24;4;4;6;18;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

The sensory modality used for learning affects grades. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 270-274, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00010.2011.-Second-year undergraduated students from 2008, 2009, and 2010 cohorts were asked to respond a questionnaire to determine their learning style preferences, the VARK questionnaire (where V is visual, A is aural, R is reading-writing, and K is kinesthetic), which was translated into Spanish by the author. The translated questionnaire was tested for wording comprehension before its application in the actual study. Using the results of the VARK questionnaire, students were classified as unimodal or multimodal and according to the first preferred sensory modality used for learning as V, A, R, or K learners. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and problems that required simple arithmetic calculations (arithmetic-type questions) were applied to the students. The relation between the main sensory modality used for learning and the grades obtained in each question type was analyzed both in unimodal and multimodal students. It was found that R unimodal students performed significantly better in arithmetic questions than A and K unimodal students (P < 0.001 by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test after ANOVA). R unimodal students also performed better than R multimodal students in arithmetic questions (P = 0.02 by a Mann-Whitney U-test). However, no differences were observed after MCQs in either unimodal or multimodal students with different first sensory modalities used for learning. When MCQ scores between unimodal and multimodal students were compared, no differences were detected. It was concluded that the sensory learning style used for learning affects student outcome when students receive arithmetic questions but not when MCQs are applied.";Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile;;Ramirez, BU (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Alameda 3363, Santiago, Chile.;beatriz.ramirez@usach.cl;;;Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [030801-RU];This work was funded by Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica Grant 030801-RU.;;22;19;20;0;14;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = iNP(o), where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and P-o the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and P-o (max) (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth FJ. G Gen Physiol 307: 97-129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at www.cecs.cl).;"Ctr Estudios Cient, Valdivia, Chile; Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santiago 6850240, Chile";;Latorre, R (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios Cient, Ave Arturo Prat 514, Valdivia, Chile.;;"Alvarez, Osvaldo/I-1077-2013; Tuluc, Petronel/C-2527-2011";"Alvarez, Osvaldo/0000-0001-8558-580X; ";;;;20;78;78;0;13;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

Most MBDs are categorized as disorders of primary hemostasis (ie, type 1 VWD and platelet function disorders), but mild or moderate deficiencies of clotting factors and some rare hyperfibrinolytic disorders are also included. These patients have abnormal bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes, menorrhagia, and disproportionate hemorrhages after trauma, invasive procedures, and surgery. This review addresses the main problems that physicians and hemostasis laboratories confront with the diagnosis of these patients, including: discerning normal/appropriate from pathological bleeding, the role and yield of screening tests, the lack of distinctive bleeding pattern among the different diseases, the inherent difficulties in the diagnosis of type 1 VWD and the most common platelet functional disorders, improvements in assays to measure platelet aggregation and secretion, and the evidence that most of the patients with MBDs end up without a definite diagnosis after exhaustive and repeated laboratory testing. Much research is needed to determine the pathogenesis of bleeding in MBD patients. Better standardization of current laboratory assays, progress in the knowledge of fibrinolytic mechanisms and their laboratory evaluation, and new understanding of the factors contributing to platelet-vessel wall interaction, along with the corresponding development of laboratory tools, should improve our capacity to diagnose a greater proportion of patients with MBDs.;"[Quiroga, Teresa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Clin Labs, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Mezzano, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Hematol Oncol, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Quiroga, T (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Clin Labs, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4686, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;tquiroga@med.puc.cl;;;;;;62;49;49;0;7;AMER SOC HEMATOLOGY;WASHINGTON;2021 L ST NW, SUITE 900, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;1520-4391;1520-4383;;HEMATOL-AM SOC HEMAT;Hematol.-Am.

It transcends the traditional bio-medical perspective in health through a bio-psycho-social and spiritual approach. Holistic point of view in palliative care is essential, and needs to be consistently hi-lighted to nursing students to improve end of life care. Objective: To describe nursing students? experience in a palliative care unit in Santiago, Chile. Design: A qualitative phenomenological study utilising purposive sampling of 10 nursing students from a Chilean university was undertaken, who completed their final year in a palliative care unit between 2017 and 2019. Methods: Data were collected using in-depth interviews, which were conducted, recorded, transcribed and analysed according to Streubert-Carpenter method. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad de los Andes, Chile. Results: Three main themes were identified in the data with their consequent units of meaning; these were experiences from all participants. The first theme identified was the diverse learning experiences students had. Topics included were: spirituality, dignity, teamworking and communication with the patient and family. They also identified personal growth. The second theme was living through the experience of difficult times; this included how they dealt facing death and how they found meaning on this. Also, patient loneliness, abandonment and the impact of shortage of human and material resources. The final theme was recognising that touching patients is often the essence of nursing and is paramount in palliative care. Conclusions: Completing a placement in a palliative care unit contributes to student nurses? personal and professional development. It provides multiple tools related to the care of terminally-ill patients and their families.

In some studies, a sex effect has been reported. Lectures are a teacher-centered learning activity. Therefore, it appeared interesting to evaluate if a stronger correlation between attendance and grades would occur in a face-to-face evidence-based medicine course with few lectures and more time dedicated to active learning methods. Small-group work and peer learning were used to foster deep learning and to engage students in their own learning process. Most of the time, students worked in small groups solving contextualized problems and critically analyzing the quality of published medical literature. Peer learning was also developed in collaborative evaluations, and constant feedback was provided. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high attenders would develop a higher self-perception of learning and obtain higher marks than low attenders. Student self-perceptions of their capacity to apply evidence-based medicine were measured by the application of an online self-assessment survey, and objective learning was measured as the grades obtained in a final accumulative individual test. It was found that male students obtained higher grades and were more confident in their achievements than their female peers, despite male and female student attendance being similar.

The inclusion of the nature of science and scientific inquiry, the connection with aspects of daily life, work based on scientific argumentation, and the use of empirical studies from current research have been identified as important aspects to include in teaching evolution. In this work, we present a series of three activities, which were developed after considering all the recommendations of the literature described above. The sequence begins with the example of the evolution of one of the species most loved by students: dogs. Through argumentation, students make their preconceptions explicit. After this, a long-term experiment about artificial selection in the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) is presented (see Glaze, 2018) as part of the reflection on the experimental evidence that supports evolution. Finally, students are asked to generate a hypothesis about how they think the domestication process of wolves occurred, eventually resulting in dogs. The outcomes of implementation in high school classrooms and biology teacher education are discussed.;"[Nunez, Paola] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Biol Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Castillo, Pablo] San Ignacio Ssalle Sch, Sci Dept, Valparaiso, Chile; [Hinojosa, Claudia] Manuel de Salas Sch, Biol Dept, Rancagua, Chile; [Parraguez, Carolina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sci Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sci Educ, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile";;Nunez, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Biol Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.;"paola.nunez@pucv.cl; pcastillo@colsis.cl; claudia.hinojosa@lms.cl; carolinapaaz.97@gmail.com; hernan.cofre@pucv.cl";;;Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181801];This material is based on work supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT), grant #1181801 to HC.;;27;0;0;1;1;NATL ASSOC BIOLOGY TEACHERS INC;RESTON;12030 SUNRISE VALLEY DR, #110, RESTON, VA 20191 USA;0002-7685;1938-4211;;AM BIOL TEACH;Am.

In motor skill acquisition, expertise is defined by automaticity. The highest level of performance with less cognitive and attentional resources characterizes this stage, allowing experts to perform multiple tasks. Conventional validated parameters as operative time, objective assessment skills scales (OSATS), and movement economy, are insufficient to distinguish if an individual has reached the more advanced learning phases, such as automaticity. There is literature about using a VSST as an attention indicator that correlates with the automaticity level. METHODS: Novices with completed and approved Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery course, and laparoscopy experts were enrolled for an experimental study and measured under dual tasks conditions. Each participant performed the test giving priority to the primary task while at the same time they responded to a VSST. The primary task consisted of 4 interrupted laparoscopic stitches (ILS) on a bench-model. The VSST was a screen that showed different patterns that the surgeon had to recognize and press a pedal while doing the stitches (PsychoPsy software, Python, MacOS). Novices were overtrained on ILS until they reach at least 100 repetitions and then were retested. Participants were video recorded and then assessed by 2 blinded evaluators who measured operative time and OSATS. These scores were considered indicators of quality for the primary task. The VSST performance was measured by the detectability index (DI), which is a ratio between correct and wrong detections. A reliable evaluation was defined as two measures of DI with less than 10% of difference, maintaining the cutoff scores for performance on the primary task (operative time <110 seg and OSATS > 17 points). RESULTS: Novices (n = 11) achieved reliable measure of the test after 2 (2-5) repetitions on the preassessment and 3.75 (2-5) on the postassessment (p = 0.04); whereas laparoscopy experts (n = 4) did it after 3.5 (3-4) repetitions. Proficiency cutoff scores for the primary task were achieved on every measure for novices (prepost over-training) and experts. Expert performance on VSST was DI 0.78 (0.69-0.87). Novice performance was significantly better on postassessment (DI-pre 0.48 [0.06-0.71] vs DI-post 0.78 [0.48-0.95], p = 0.003). Overtraining consisted in 140 (100-210) repetitions of ILS for all novices, made in 8 hours (3-15). By categorizing DI based on expert performance, novices with DI-post > 0.65 achieved better OSATS score and less operative time than novices with DI-post < 0.65 (p = 0.007 y, p = 0.089, respectively). CONCLUSION: Measuring automaticity is feasible using a VSST. This instrument is reliable and has a face, content and construct validity. A DI over 0.65 may be a cutoff point correlated with high standard performance on the primary task. This instrument measures performance on laparoscopic skills,. and along with conventional indicators, would better define advance levels of expertise. More studies are required applying this VSST to achieve external validity by reproducing our results. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

First, we analyzed the levels of resilience and internalized problems (defined as group of emotional symptoms) in children aged 9 to 12 years. Second, we examined whether the relationship between them varies according to the low or high vulnerability of school communities. METHODS About 1460 students from schools in northern Chile participated. A total of 52.6% were girls, and 47.4% were boys. The scales of internalizing problems of the System of Evaluation of Children and Adolescents (SENA) and the short scale of resilience (CYRM-12) were applied. Correlations in each group and differences between groups were analyzed using a MANOVA. A 2-level path analysis was also performed. RESULTS Resilience was higher in the context of low vulnerability while depression, social anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptomatology were greater in the context of high vulnerability. A 2-level path analysis showed that the slope of gender, anxiety, and depression symptomatology varies between schools and an interaction effect between vulnerability and anxiety symptomatology. CONCLUSION There are differences in the relationship between internalized problems and resilience according to whether the students belong to low or high vulnerability establishments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between internalizing problems and resilience.;"[Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Caqueo-Urizar, Alejandra] Univ Tarapaca, Inst Alta Invest, Calle Antofagasta 1520, Arica, Chile";;"Flores, J (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.; Flores, J (corresponding author), CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.";"jflores@uta.cl; acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl; cristianramirezvallejos@gmail.com; diaz.patricia.psicologia@gmail.com; claudiafernandad.t@hotmail.com; lorenalopezreyes@gmail.com";;; [PIACIE160007];This research was funded by ANID PIACIE160007.;;46;0;0;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-4391;1746-1561;;J SCHOOL HEALTH;J.

Most researchers have examined individual-level characteristics, but the perception of school climate and school characteristics such as type, size, and level of vulnerabilities have not been considered using multilevel methods. Using a sample of 8,237 Chilean seventh graders from 1,322 schools we examined individual-and school-level predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. Cyberbullying perpetration was predicted by prior victimization, interpersonal relationships, and gender. We found an interaction effect between interpersonal relationships and teacher support for victims. Our findings support the notion that school policies and culture can play a vital role in the prevention of cyberbullying, supporting a protective resilience model.;"[Varela, Jorge J.] Univ Desarollo, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Zimmerman, Marc A.] Univ Michigan, Prevent Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ryan, Allison M.] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stoddard, Sarah A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nursing, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";;Varela, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Ave Plaza 680, Santiago 7610658, Chile.;jovarela@udd.cl;;;;;;49;3;3;0;20;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1538-8220;1538-8239;;J SCH VIOLENCE;J.

Nevertheless, although bullying often can be discriminatory (e.g., homophobic), there remains limited attention to how issues of diversity relate to students reporting their victimization experiences. Among 572 students in four Chilean high schools, we tested a model in which multiple factors predicted students' consistency of reporting victimization. Students who perceived having a sexual orientation/gender identity-specific antibullying policy reported less frequently hearing teachers or staff make homophobic comments, and students who perceived having a general antibullying policy reported that teachers and staff more frequently intervened against homophobic behavior. In turn, hearing teachers and staff make fewer homophobic comments and seeing them more frequently correct homophobic behavior related to students reporting stronger trust in their teachers and staff. Finally, stronger trust in teachers and staff was associated with more consistently reporting victimization experiences.;"[Berger, Christian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Paul Poteat, V.] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ, Boston, MA USA; [Dantas, Julio] Todo Mejora, Santiago, Chile";;Berger, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;cberger@uc.cl;;Berger, Christian/0000-0003-1909-7490;"OREALC/UNESCO Santiago [4500278883]; Todo Mejora";This study was funded by OREALC/UNESCO Santiago (Partners Agreement 4500278883), and sponsored by Todo Mejora.;;52;8;8;2;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1538-8220;1538-8239;;J SCH VIOLENCE;J.

In men, we expect physical aggression (PA) and sociality to be negative predictors of academic performance. However, in women, PA would be a negative predictor of academic performance, and sociality a positive one. Our results report a negative association between academic performance and PA in both sexes. As we expected, social effect derived from the use of PA seems to be different for each sex, where men could display a rebellious attitude to increase chances of finding a mate. In contrast, results for women are not conclusive, because no relationship between academic performance and any aggressive mechanism, were predicted by sociality.

A total of 1,040 preschool children, aged 3 to 6 years, participated in this study. In all children, standardized dynamic balance test, and several cognitive functioning measures were used. The results indicate that the CGT has adequate reliability and validity. In the test-retest analysis (n = 90), the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.901 (p < .001). A significant correlation between the initial test and retest (r = 0.821,p < .001) and between the CGT and dynamic balance test (r = -0.432,p < .001), Porteus Maze Test (PMT) (r = -0.416,p = .011), and Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test (GHDT) (r = -0.386,p < .001) was found. Boys showed a better performance than girls at 3-6 years old. The CGT showed excellent reliability and validity in preschool children and may serve as a potential biomarker in cognitive development.;"[Angel Latorre-Roman, Pedro; Consuegra Gonzalez, Pedro Jose; Lucena Zurita, Manuel; Perez Jimenez, Inmaculada; Parraga-Montilla, J.

Quantitatively, each article's edit history was analyzed by Wikipedia X-tools, references and media were counted manually, and two readability indices were used to evaluate article readability. This analysis revealed that each article was updated 8.3 +/- 6.8 times per month, and referenced with 33.5 +/- 24.3 sources, such as journal articles and textbooks. Each article contained on average 14.0 +/- 7.6 media items. The readability indices including: (1) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Test and (2) Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula demonstrated that the articles had low readability and were more appropriate for college students and above. Qualitatively, the sampled articles were evaluated by experts using a modified DISCERN survey. According to the modified DISCERN, 13 articles (32.5%), 24 articles (60%), 3 articles (7.5%), were rated as good, moderate, and poor, respectively. There were positive correlations between the DISCERN score and the number of edits (r = 0.537), number of editors (r = 0.560), and article length (r = 0.536). Strengths reported by the panel included completeness and coverage in 11 articles (27.5%), anatomical details in 10 articles (25%), and clinical details in 5 articles (12.5%). The panel also noted areas which could be improved, such as providing missing information in 28 articles (70%), inaccuracies in 10 articles (25%), and lack or poor use of images in 17 articles (42.5%). In conclusion, this study revealed that many Wikipedia anatomy articles were difficult to read. Each article's quality was dependent on edit frequency and article length. Learners and students should be cautious when using Wikipedia articles for anatomy education due to these limitations.;"[Suwannakhan, Athikhun; Yurasakpong, Laphatrada; Meemon, Krai] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Anat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Casanova-Martinez, Daniel] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Med, Morphol Unit, San Felipe, Chile; [Montriwat, Punchalee] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Biol & Biol Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Limpanuparb, Taweetham] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand";;Limpanuparb, T (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;taweetham.lim@mahidol.edu;"Limpanuparb, Taweetham/A-6295-2011; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAA-1024-2020; Meemon, Krai/C-3803-2015; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAH-4643-2019";"Limpanuparb, Taweetham/0000-0002-8558-6199; Meemon, Krai/0000-0001-5700-2646; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/0000-0001-9910-0244";Wikimedia Foundation [PHD/0087/2560];The authors wish to thank the three anonymous experts who volunteered to participate in our study.

Prevalence ranged from 3.1% of students carrying gun to 17.9% who saw another student with a weapon. In 3.3% of schools, more than 15% of students carried a weapon and in 5.8% of schools, 15% or more were injured or threatened with weapons. The strongest predictors were the number of transgender students, gang members, and victimized students, particularly those victimized because of their disability.

The current study investigated patterns in teacher identification of student emotional and behavioral challenges, as well as their provision of supports. Participants were 172 elementary, middle, and high school teachers from a Northeastern school district who responded to two vignettes-one describing a female student with internalizing and one describing a male student with externalizing symptoms. Vignettes were randomized to be moderate or severe. Teachers rated concern for students and their likelihood of providing a series of responses and supports. Results indicated that teachers were more concerned about severe than moderate vignettes, and were more concerned about females with internalizing than males with externalizing symptoms. Middle school teachers rated vignettes as more concerning than elementary teachers, particularly the male externalizing vignette. Elementary teachers indicated that they would provide more classroom-based emotional/behavioral supports and specialty supports than middle and high school teachers; however, high school teachers more often indicated that they would reduce expectations and provide a referral for students.

Self-determination involves skills to help make things they want happen in their own lives. In people with intellectual disabilities over 45, self-advocacy and self-awareness skills could be strengthened. Age, place of residence and support received by people with intellectual disabilities over 45, are some of the things that influence their self-determination. Background Self-determination is a key construct to guarantee the development of skills that allow people with disabilities to acquire control over their lives. However, people with intellectual disabilities may have premature ageing processes that make it difficult to exercise these skills. This study seeks to determine the self-determination levels of 516 ageing adults with intellectual disabilities between the ages of 45 and 86 years. Method The data were collected with an ad hoc scale developed from the Functional Model of Self-Determination. Findings The results show that competencies related to self-advocacy and self-knowledge greatly decreased, unlike making choices and solving problems. In addition, the severity of the disability, age, place of residence and type of support are identified as variables associated with levels of self-determination. Conclusions There is a need to prioritise the acquisition and maintenance of skills related to self-realisation as the basis for intervention proposals in self-determination.;"[Alvarez-Aguado, Izaskun] Univ Las Amer, Fac Salud & Ciencias Sociales, Sede Providencia, Manuel Montt 948, Santiago, Chile; [Vega Cordova, Vanessa; Spencer Gonzalez, Herbert; Gonzalez Carrasco, Felix; Jarpa Azagra, Marcela; Exss Cid, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Alvarez-Aguado, I (corresponding author), Univ Las Amer, Fac Salud & Ciencias Sociales, Sede Providencia, Manuel Montt 948, Santiago, Chile.;ialvareza@udla.cl;;Alvarez-Aguado, Izaskun/0000-0002-8021-525X;ANID FONDECYT DE POSTDOCTORADO [3190675];ANID FONDECYT DE POSTDOCTORADO No 3190675;;52;0;0;3;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1354-4187;1468-3156;;BRIT J LEARN DISABIL;Brit.

In this article, we generalize this problem to an arbitrary surface, including the effects of friction, and provide a general expression to determine under what conditions a particle will leave the surface. An explicit integral form for the speed is given, which is analytically integrable for some cases. We demonstrate general criteria to determine the critical speed at which the particle immediately leaves the surface. Three curves, a circle, a cycloid, and a catenary, are analyzed in detail, revealing several interesting features.

It opened up a vast phenomenological field that includes the chaotic world of turbulence and the reign of viscous fluids. Nonetheless, it is often left aside from general physics courses and down-to-earth applications because it seems too complicated. In this paper, we present a phenomenological model for a gas caught inside a cylinder with a moving piston, such as those of conventional combustion engines, and thus show that after a few simplifications the kinetic theory is comprehensible and allows satisfactory simulations even in nonequilibrium regimes.;Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Elect, Valparaiso, Chile;;Wendler, T (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Elect, Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.;"thomasw@elo.utfsm.cl; jgb@elo.utfsm.cl";Wendler, Thomas/J-7492-2015;Wendler, Thomas/0000-0002-0915-0510;;;;5;1;1;0;0;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

The bound state probability profile decays exponentially away from the origin, with a profile width that increases monotonically with alpha, becoming an almost completely extended state when alpha-->2(-). At alpha =2, the bound state suffers a discontinuous change to a delta function-like profile. A further increase of a increases the width of the probability profile, although the bound state is stable only for alpha <2. The transmission of plane waves across the potential increases monotonically with <alpha> and is insensitive to the sign of the opacity Omega.

J;"Palma, G; Raff, U";;;;"Palma, Guillermo; Raff, Ulrich";;;A novel application of a Fourier integral representation of bound states in quantum mechanics;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;HARMONIC-OSCILLATOR;A method is developed to find the bound state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one-dimensional and rotational symmetric three-dimensional quantum mechanical problems. The method is based on the fact that eigenfunctions of bound states are square integrable. We use this property and a judicious ansatz inspired on its asymptotic behavior to obtain a differential equation that can be solved straightforwardly using a Fourier transform. The main advantage of the method is that it avoids the traditional and tedious convergence analysis using a series representation. The method leads to an integral representation of the wave function and provides insight into concepts such as energy quantization, spectrum degeneracy, and bound states.

The discussion is kept concrete by reducing the space dimensions to 2, considering 'spinless antineutrinos' in 2 + 1 space-time dimensions. Solutions to specific problems in particle physics are often hindered by the technical complexities encountered in (3 + 1)-dimensions. In such cases, it is convenient to have a lower space dimensional model at ones disposal that captures some physical features while reducing technical difficulties to a minimum.

The objective was threefold: 1) to develop multidisciplinary skills, 2) to introduce students to professional-style projects and 3) to integrate knowledge from core courses. In order to develop a wider awareness about how they are seen in their environment, an automated peer assessment system focused in feedback was applied. Ahundred students of both disciplines took part in this activity over 6 weeks. The activity was generally well received by students. Mutual dependence from peer's work raised awareness about the importance of responsibility, while leadership was perceived through a different perspective. Skills such as conflict resolution, planning and enthusiasm were identified as key issues to boost teamwork. In conclusion, the professional-like environment allowed students to see how their future activity will be, while access to technology and industrial environments were important drivers to motivate them.

Conversely, a phenomenon described by classical physics should contain no explicit reference to (h) over bar. However, the problem of a particle encountering a discontinuous potential step, which is one of the simplest examples in quantum mechanics, contradicts this common thought: even when the particle carries enough kinetic energy to go across the step, the resulting expression for the reflection probability is nonzero-a purely quantum phenomenon-and yet it contains no reference to (h) over bar. We show that the absence of (h) over bar in this purely quantum expression is due to the idealised limit in which the potential rises sharply at a single position, thus losing any reference to a length dimension in the problem. To address the correct classical limit of the phenomenon we first regularise the discontinuity in the potential by taking a continuous linearly rising function over a distance a. We show that the correct classical limit, which is when no reflection occurs, is obtained for large values of a, not for vanishing a. The latter actually corresponds to a purely quantum case, albeit in a limiting case of a discontinuously abrupt change in the potential at a single point in space.;"[Dib, Claudio O.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Ctr Cient & Tecnol Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Dib, Claudio O.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Valparaiso, Chile; [Orellana, Oscar] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Math, Valparaiso, Chile";;"Dib, CO (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Ctr Cient & Tecnol Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.; Dib, CO (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Valparaiso, Chile.";"claudio.dib@usm.cl; oscar.orellana@usm.cl";;;"Fondecyt, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130617, 1141260]; Conicyt, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ACT1406, FB0821]";This work was supported in part by Fondecyt grants 1130617 and 1141260, and Conicyt grants ACT1406 and FB0821, Chile.;;15;1;1;0;9;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

A pedagogical glance at the origin of mass;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"PLASMA; FIELD";Among the most startling experiences a student encounters is learning that, unlike electrons and other elementary particles, photons have no mass. Under certain circumstances, however, the light quantum behaves as if it did have a finite mass. Starting from Maxwell's equations, we discuss how this arises when light interacts with a charged plasma, or travels along a waveguide. The motion of such photons is analysed using kinematic concepts of special relativity, and we show how a cutoff frequency for effective propagation appears. Seeing how an environment may yield an apparent dynamic mass to the photon paves the way for later understanding: might the Higgs boson field provide other particles, such as the electron, with a mass? This paper is addressed to mid-level physics students, teachers and lecturers, requiring only a knowledge of classical electromagnetic and special relativity theories.;"[Robles, P.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Elect, Valparaiso, Chile; [Claro, F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 22, Chile";;Robles, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Elect, Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.;"probles@ucv.cl; fclaro@uc.cl";;claro, francisco/0000-0003-2122-6992;Escuela de Ingenieria Electrica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso;We are grateful to Dr P Gaete of the Physics Department, Universidad Santa Maria, for helpful discussions and a critical reading of this manuscript.

J;"Palma, G; Oyarzun, R; Raff, U";;;;"Palma, G; Oyarzun, R; Raff, U";;;Generalization of the electrostatic potential function for an infinite charge distribution;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;The asymptotic conditions needed to define the electrostatic potential due to an infinite charge distribution are studied in detail. It is shown that if the charge distribution decreases faster than the square of the distance when \r\ goes to infinity, the convolution integral defining the potential exists, goes to zero as \r\ goes to infinity, and therefore allows the calculation of the electric potential function at any point in space, even if the total charge is infinite. We illustrate the calculation of the electric potential with a simple example of a spherically symmetric infinite charge distribution.

Using the Lagrangian formalism, the equations of motion are derived, as are. their solutions and constants of motion. Normal modes of oscillations and their corresponding normal coordinates are obtained that strongly depend on the initial condition; therefore, we observe that the oscillation along the line that joins the particles is non-isochronous. In addition, particular attention has been paid to the planar motion, without the pseudomomentum component parallel to the magnetic field, where one longitudinal mode and two transversal modes are obtained.";"[del Pino, L.

However, the GUM presents some inconsistencies, both internally and with respect to its two later Supplements. For this reason, the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology, which is responsible for these documents, has decided that a major revision of the GUM is needed. This will be done by following the principles of Bayesian statistics, a concise summary of which is presented in this article. Those principles should be useful in physics and engineering laboratory courses that teach the fundamentals of data analysis and measurement uncertainty evaluation.;[Lira, I.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile;;Lira, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;ilira@ing.puc.cl;;;Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141165];I thank Dieter Grientschnig for reading the final draft of this manuscript and offering valuable suggestions for its improvement.

They consider the reflected and not the transmitted light for two instead of the four types of thin films. In this work, we complement the discussion in elementary textbooks, by analysing the phase differences required to match the conditions for constructive and destructive interference, in the reflected and transmitted light in four types of thin films. We consider thin films with varied sequences in the refractive index, which we identify as barriers, wells and stairs (up and down). Also, we use the conservation of energy in order to understand the complementary colour fringes observed in the reflected and transmitted light through thin films. We analyse systematically the phase changes by introducing a phase table and we synthesize the results in a circular diagram matching 16 physical situations of interference and their corresponding conditions on the film thickness. The phase table and the circular diagram are a pair of tools easily assimilated by students, and useful to organize, analyse and activate the knowledge about thin films.;"[Rojas, Roberto; Fuster, Gonzalo; Sluesarenko, Viktor] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Fis, Valparaiso, Chile";;Rojas, R (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Fis, Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.;roberto.rojas@usm.cl;;;Direccion General de Investigacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria [11.08.56, 11.09.71];We want to thank to the Direccion General de Investigacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria for grants 11.08.56 and 11.09.71.

To illustrate this, is modeled mechanically a triatomic molecule using the Lagrangian formulation and assuming a type of molecule in which the masses (atoms) are located at the vertices of a triangle. For an analytical treatment of the problem we use the theory of small oscillations, considering equal masses (atoms) and coupling constants. This allows to write the Lagrangian, and then to obtain dynamical equations for determining normal vibration frequencies. The case of the linear triatomic molecule is analyzed and discussed, determining the corresponding vibrational normal modes. Finally, the solutions for both cases are compared.;"[Lavin, Roberto; Pozo, Julio] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Basicas, Santiago, Chile";;Lavin, R (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Basicas, Santiago, Chile.;julio.pozo@udp.cl;;;;;;10;1;1;0;3;SOC BRASILEIRA FISICA;SAO PAULO;CAIXA POSTAL 66328, 05315-970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL;1806-1117;;;REV BRAS ENSINO FIS;Rev.

The resulting 1/r(2) power law appears in other contexts and can be easily understood by the conservation of the total energy traversing concentric spherical surfaces of different radii. The typical verification of this law in the laboratory involves the use of a darkened room, a big restriction for this important experiment to be implemented in a modern inquiry based curriculum. To avoid this restriction, we designed a simple apparatus to measure the falloff of the irradiance with distance that can be used in daylight conditions.;"[Vera, Francisco; Rivera, Rodrigo; Ortiz, Manuel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile";;Vera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;fvera@ucv.cl;;Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390;"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; DGIP-PUCV";We would like to acknowledge financial support from FONDECYT Project 1110713 and from DGIP-PUCV.;;2;5;5;2;15;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

J;Romo-Kroger, CM;;;;Romo-Kroeger, C. M.;;;Testing plastic deformations of materials in the introductory undergraduate mechanics laboratory;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"EVOLUTION; COPPER";Normally, a mechanics laboratory at the undergraduate level includes an experiment to verify compliance with Hooke's law in materials, such as a steel spring and an elastic rubber band. Stress-strain curves are found for these elements. Compression in elastic bands is practically impossible to achieve due to flaccidity. A typical experiment for the complete loading-unloading cycle is to subject a tubular object to torsion. This paper suggests simple experiments for studying properties concerning elasticity and plasticity in elements of common use, subjected to stretching or compression, and also torsion reinforcing. The experiments use plastic binders, rubber bands and metal springs under a moderate load. This paper discusses an experiment with an original device to measure torsion deformations as a function of applied torques, which permitted construction of the hysteresis cycle for a rubber hose and various tubes. Another experiment was designed to define the temporal recovery of a plastic spring with initial stretching. A simple mathematical model was developed to explain this phenomenon.;Catholic Univ Maule, Basic Sci Fac, Talca, Chile;;Romo-Kroger, CM (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Maule, Basic Sci Fac, Casilla 617, Talca, Chile.;cromo@ucm.cl;;Romo Kroger, Carlos Manuel/0000-0002-1306-5423;;;;16;2;2;1;13;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

An optical torque is induced by a circularly polarized beam, causing the object to rotate. The effect depends on absorption and geometry in such a way that an isotropic dissipationless object is not affected by the external field. Under constant illumination an asymmetric object may rotate uniformly if the light intensity exceeds a minimum value, below which the object executes a rocking motion. These findings are applied to a bioparticle with spheroidal symmetry. (C) 2011 American Association of Physics Teachers.

A list of abilities and knowledge attributes were derived from similar studies and the expectations expressed by professional organizations. Input was received from managers of 75 different companies across a broad range of industries and sizes and 116 engineering graduates regarding the importance and preparation for 57 abilities and knowledge attributes in 10 categories. Each competency was given a priority based on one of three criteria: 50% or more of managers reporting it to be of the highest level of importance, an average rating greater than a cutoff, and a weighted measure of priority incorporating the importance and gap between graduate preparation and needs. The results suggest that, to managers in Chile, the most important non-technical competencies are in the areas of project control, ethics, communications, teamwork, innovation and budgeting. The competencies identified as important were similar to those seen in studies in other countries, but with a greater emphasis on ethics and innovation and less emphasis on quality and customer focus. A method for prioritizing the important competencies was also presented. Many initiatives were proposed to improve specific non-technical competencies that graduates need for competing in the Chilean job market. This paper presents the methodology, the findings, the comparisons with results from similar studies in other countries, and the strategies developed as a result of the findings.;"[Leboeuf, Richard; Espinoza, Ricardo] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile; [Pizarro, Matias] Univ Los Andes, AlumniUANDES, Santiago 7620001, Chile";;Leboeuf, R (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Avda San Carlos de Apoquindo 2200, Santiago 7620001, Chile.;"rleboeuf@uandes.cl; mpizarro@miuandes.cl; ricardo.espinoza@uandes.cl";;;;;;27;3;3;0;15;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Two key aspects of this experiment that make possible a successful measurement of the content of oxygen in the air are the use of a closed atmosphere and the use of a chemical reaction that involves the oxidation of a solid element into a solid oxide. The oxygen for the chemical reaction is provided by the closed volume of air, whose volume changes are easy to measure. In previous versions of the steel wool experiment, several days were needed to complete it; however, the experiment can be completed in about 30 min by cleaning the steel wool using acetone and then washing it in acetic acid or vinegar. A new simple closed-volume experiment to measure the oxygen content in the air is described that can be completed in a few minutes. In this experiment, steel wool is placed inside a glass tube that is connected with two normal glass syringes. The tube is then heated by a flame and the air in the syringes is forced, by moving the syringes plungers, to pass through the heated steel wool. This experiment is an excellent classroom illustration of the 21% of O(2) in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a complement to the steel wool-acetic acid experiment.";"[Vera, Francisco; Rivera, Rodrigo; Nunez, Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile";;Rivera, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;rodrigo.rivera@ucv.cl;Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/M-4058-2017;"Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/0000-0001-8506-2494; Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390";"FON-DEF [TE10I012]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; DGIP-PUCV";We would like to acknowledge financial support from FON-DEF Project TE10I012, FONDECYT Project 1110713 and from DGIP-PUCV.;;5;4;4;0;28;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9584;;;J CHEM EDUC;J.

To design and evaluate a practical activity for teaching the operation and control of a plant for purified water production. Design. A practical activity using a distilled water production plant was developed; physicochemical parameters of the water were measured at different sampling points; the students of Unit Operations course were given a questionnaire and a survey on the design and contents of the practical activity. Assessment. Seventy percent of the students were able to explain the USP requirements for purified water, to decide how to choose the sampling points, and to evaluate the plant operation performance. Fifty-three percent of the students could establish the specific purification capability and limitations of the deionization step, but only 26% were able of proposing corrective actions in the case of failure of some of the system's parameters. Conclusion. The students' opinion regarding the practical activity and the design of the laboratory guide was positive.

J;"Rivera, R; Villarroel, D";;;;"Rivera, R; Villarroel, D";;;Synchrotron radiation and symmetries;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;The total power of radiation emitted by a monoenergetic electron in circular orbit is derived by calculating the instantaneous energy flux of the electron field across the surfaces of spheres and tori that enclose the orbit. These surfaces are such that the positions of the electron at different times are indistinguishable with respect to them, which in turn permits the choice of special spheres and tori that greatly simplify the calculations. The total power of radiation of an electron is usually derived in textbooks with the help of the relativistic formalism. But for the particular motion in a synchrotron, the total power of radiation is obtained here working in the ordinary three-dimensional physical space, where the calculations are conceptually easier to follow than in Minskowski space, especially for students who are taking a first course of electrodynamics.

This classic demonstration is used in introductory physics courses to show that after eliminating the friction force with the air, the piece of paper falls with acceleration g. To test if the paper falls behind the book in a nearly free fall motion or if it is dragged by the book, we designed a version of this experiment that includes a ball and a piece of paper over a book that is forced to fall using elastic cords. We recorded a video of our experiment using a high-speed video camera at 300 frames per second that shows that the book and the paper fall faster than the ball, which falls well behind the book with an acceleration approximately equal to g. Our experiment shows that the piece of paper is dragged behind the book and therefore the paper and book demonstration should not be used to show that all objects fall with acceleration g independently of their mass.;"[Vera, F.; Rivera, R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile";;Vera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;fvera@ucv.cl;;Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390;"FONDEF ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [TE10I012]; FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; DGIP-PUCV";We would like to acknowledge financial support from FONDEF Project TE10I012, FONDECYT Project 1110713 and from DGIP-PUCV.;;21;6;6;1;14;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

In this strategy, students communicate face-to-face through a social network while supporting their work with handhelds interconnected through a wireless network. Information transfers from the social network to the handheld network and vice versa, meaning that collaborators maintain face-to-face interaction at all times while also being able to obtain and retrieve information. To implement this strategy, a technology tool named CollPad was created and applied in two computer science courses.

J;Lira, I;;;;Lira, Ignacio;;;Introducing scale analysis by way of a pendulum;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;PERIOD;Empirical correlations are a practical means of providing approximate answers to problems in physics whose exact solution is otherwise difficult to obtain. The correlations relate quantities that are deemed to be important in the physical situation to which they apply, and can be derived from experimental data by means of dimensional and/or scale analysis. These techniques are discussed through two examples. The first example involves determining the period of a pendulum, for which a simple yet very accurate correlation at arbitrary amplitudes of oscillation is derived. The second example refers to a more practical application, that of obtaining a heat transfer coefficient. In the appendix, the proposed correlation for the period of the pendulum is compared with other approximate formulae in the literature.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile;;Lira, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;ilira@ing.puc.cl;Lira, Ignacio/F-9016-2013;;;;;21;2;2;0;2;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

These difficulties are due, among other things, to the fact that traditional teaching does not consider the findings of research on students' learning in this particular domain of chemistry. In this commentary, we propose research-based criteria for the selection of experiments that respond to the learning difficulties in chemical kinetics that have been widely reported in recent years. Additionally, we discuss a teaching strategy that may be appropriate to favor the evolution of students' intuitive conceptions by evaluating their ideas and those of their peers in the analysis of scientific evidence.;"[Marzabal, Ainoa; Moreira, Patricia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Delgado, Virginia; Barrientos, Lorena; Moreno, Jeannette] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Quim, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;Marzabal, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile.;amarzabal@uc.cl;"; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017; Barrientos, Lorena/J-8906-2017";"Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Delgado-Chang, Virginia/0000-0001-6299-4686; Barrientos, Lorena/0000-0002-9641-6507";Vicente Talanquer;We acknowledge the support of Vicente Talanquer.;;32;3;3;6;32;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9584;1938-1328;;J CHEM EDUC;J.

It is particularly difficult to adapt courses that depend on physical equipment to be now carried out remotely. This is the case for bioinformatics, which typically requires dedicated computer classrooms, as the logistics of granting remote access to a workstation or relying on the computational resources of each student is not trivial. A possible workaround is using cloud server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling, molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly described. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, a pool of students positively evaluated these tutorials in terms of the time required for their completion, their ability to understand the content and exercises developed in each session, and the practical significance and impact that these computational tools have on scientific research.

The geometrical symmetries and the time dependence of the current density make possible a mathematical treatment that does not involve the usual technical difficulties, thus making this presentation suitable for students that are taking a first course in electromagnetism. We also show that the electric field generated by the solenoid can be used to construct an exact solution of the relativistic equation of motion of the electron that takes into account the effect of the radiation.

Because some books use the Newtonian kinetic energy and others use the total relativistic energy (including the rest energy), the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic phase velocity differs from the Newtonian phase velocity, which can be confusing for many students. This paper proposes expressing the phase velocity by first subtracting the rest energy from the relativistic energy before imposing the usual de Broglie relations. In addition to providing the corresponding Newtonian phase velocity, it also provides a relativistic Schrdinger equation which intuitively reduces to the non-relativistic Schrdinger equation in the appropriate regime. The problem of the equivalence between the relativistic Schrdinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation is also addressed by using arguments which can be understood by undergraduate students.;[Mundarain, Douglas] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile;;Mundarain, D (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile.;dmundarain@ucn.cl;;;;;;12;2;2;1;37;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

J;Mundarain, D;;;;Mundarain, Douglas;;;On the infinities in the electric potential of unbounded charge distributions;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"electric potential; Coulomb's potential; renormalization";"DIMENSIONAL REGULARIZATION; RENORMALIZATION";In every beginner electricity and magnetism course, a good teacher usually insists that if one has an infinite charged plate or an infinity charged wire, one must first calculate the electric field to find the potential difference between two space points by making a linear integral of the field. One does it this way because Coulomb's potential, i.e. the expression which allows for a direct calculation of the potential without first calculating the electric field, should not be used since these charge distributions are not bounded in space. Due to the unbounded nature of these distributions, Coulomb's potential diverges at all points of space in the two previously mentioned cases. However, in this work, we are going to demonstrate that in fact one can use Coulomb's potential to find the correct results by properly removing the infinities that appear in the potential of these distributions. This is possible because electric potential, like potential energy, is only defined up to an additive constant, which in the mentioned cases can be chosen as an infinite constant. One can show that the removal of these infinities is a simple example of the renormalization techniques commonly used in quantum field theory.;[Mundarain, Douglas] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile;;Mundarain, D (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile.;dmundarain@ucn.cl;;;;;;7;0;0;1;7;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;1361-6404;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

For real systems, however, uncertainty is largely present via external forces such as friction or lack of precise knowledge about the initial conditions of the system. In this work we focus on the latter case and describe the use of inference methodologies in solving the statistical properties of classical systems subject to uncertain initial conditions. In particular we describe the application of the formalism of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inference to the problem of projectile motion, given information about the average horizontal range over many realizations. By using MaxEnt we can invert the problem and use the provided information on the average range to reduce the original uncertainty in the initial conditions. Also, additional insight into the initial condition's probabilities, and the projectile path distribution itself, can be achieved based on the value of the average horizontal range. The wide applicability of this procedure, as well as its ease of use, reveals a useful tool with which to revisit a large number of physics problems, from classrooms to frontier research.;"[Montecinos, Alejandra; Davis, Sergio; Peralta, Joaquin] Univ Andres Bello, Dept Ciencias Fis, Sazie 2212 Piso 7, Santiago, Chile; [Davis, Sergio] Comis Chilena Energia Nucl, Casilla 188-D, Santiago, Chile";;Montecinos, A (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept Ciencias Fis, Sazie 2212 Piso 7, Santiago, Chile.;alejandramontecinos@unab.cl;"Peralta, Joaquin/A-2832-2012; Davis, Sergio/F-3415-2011; Davis, Sergio/U-7227-2019";"Peralta, Joaquin/0000-0003-2934-4942; Davis, Sergio/0000-0003-2757-332X; Davis, Sergio/0000-0003-2757-332X";"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140514]; Proyecto FONDECYT IniciacionComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11130501]; Proyecto [UNAB DI-15-17/RG]";This work is supported by Proyecto FONDECYT 1140514.

We consider the physical setup where the semi-sphere is free to move over a flat surface. For simplicity, we assume that all surfaces are friction-less. We analyze the values for the last contact angle theta (&#x22c6;), corresponding to the angle when the object and the semi-sphere detach one of each other. We consider all possible scenarios with different combination of mass values: m ( A ) and m ( B ), and the initial velocity of the sliding object A. We found that the last contact angle only depends on the ratio between the masses, and it is independent of the acceleration of gravity and semi-sphere's radius. In addition, we found that the largest possible value of theta (&#x22c6;) is 48.19 degrees that coincides with the case of a fixed semi-sphere. On the opposite case, the minimum value of theta (&#x22c6;) is 0 degrees and it occurs then the object on the semi-sphere is extremely heavy, occurring the detachment as soon as the sliding body touches the semi-sphere. In addition, we found that if the initial kinetic energy of the sliding object A is half the value of the potential energy with respect to the floor.

By using photographs of the Moon taken with a smartphone through a simple telescope, we were able to introduce these concepts to high-school students and lower-level college students. We teach students how to calculate lengths of mountain ranges or areas of craters on the Moon's surface and introduce ideas of geodesics and spherical triangles. Students can see that accurate measurements cannot be obtained using flat geometry. Instead, by using three-dimensional curved geometry, estimates of lengths and areas can be computed with less than 4% error.

These types of presentations are also intended for students to learn or improve oral presentation techniques, which generally enrich their communication skills. However, these activities are usually carried out without prior preparation or without well-defined terms of reference, obtaining different results, even within homogeneous groups of students. The objective of the paper is focused on determining the effect of microteaching on engineering students' oral presentation techniques and improve communications skills. To measure its impact, three courses of different levels of the civil engineering career were selected (152 students), separating in each of them two groups of students. Each group of students has been asked to prepare different oral presentations. The first group of students prepared the presentation in a traditional way, while, the second group of students prepared the presentation as if it were a microteaching session. The oral presentations of the groups were evaluated, finding that the microteaching has a favorable impact on the improvement of the communications skills of the students.;"[Fernando Herrera, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Appl Comp Sci Intro Civil Engn Planning & Project, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Carlos Vielma, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Munoz La Rivera, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Struct Anal Solid Mech Numer Anal & Geotech, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Fernando Herrera, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile";;"Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Appl Comp Sci Intro Civil Engn Planning & Project, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile.";"rodrigo.herrera@pucv.cl; juan.vielma@pucv.cl; fmunozlarivera@gmail.com";"Vielma-Perez, Juan C./C-6863-2018; Muñoz La Rivera, Felipe/AAX-9588-2021";"Vielma-Perez, Juan C./0000-0001-5426-2215; ";"CORFO Project [14ENI2-26905 Ingenieria 2030-PUCV]; VRI Grant of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile";The following investigation was made thanks to the contributions of the CORFO Project 14ENI2-26905 Ingenieria 2030-PUCV.

In the three-dimensional case, the first correction term depends only on the area-volume ratio, but higher order terms depend also on other geometric properties of the container.

Service-learning is an active methodology that has been applied in several teaching areas and multiple areas of knowledge at college level. Several papers propose software project development based on agile methods in learning contexts, but papers focusing on efforts to combine Service-learning with agile software development methods to improve students' software development project skills are not so common. This paper reports the experience of combining Service-learning with the stages of a software development methodology inspired by Agile Manifesto. It describes a teaching innovation, which consists in providing students with an active and motivating teaching-learning environment in a computing subject to attain three objectives: (1) improving students' skills for developing high-quality software applications in a working context similar to professional software development practice; (2) decreasing the subject drop-out rate; and (3) familiarizing students with solidarity and community work. This pilot experience at a university in northern Chile involves the active participation of a community partner (Help Desk for People with Disabilities at Antofagasta Municipality). This paper describes the methodology used in the creation of a software product (prototype version) in the context of solidarity work for regional Paralympic games. The innovation was developed within the framework of a subject in the Major in Computer and Information Technology Engineering.

We study the classical behaviour of an electric dipole in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. We obtain equations and constants of motion from the Lagrangian formulation. We find an infinitely periodic effective potential that describes a rotational motion. The problem is not directly separable in relative and centre-of-mass variables, even though we are able to write the energy of the system as a function of only one term, the relative variable. We define another constant of motion, which couples the relative with the centre-of-mass variables. We describe conditions for the bound states of the dipole. In addition, we discuss the problem in the approximation of small oscillations. Finally, we explore the existence of a possible family of trapped states in a region of the space where there are no classical turning points.;Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Antofagasta, Chile;;Troncoso, P (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile.;scurilef@ucn.cl;Curilef, Sergio/O-8481-2015;"curilef, sergio/0000-0002-8318-3206; Troncoso Iribarren, Paulina/0000-0001-6162-3023";;;;13;5;5;1;4;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0143-0807;;;EUR J PHYS;Eur.

The solution is obtained in closed form and resembles the solution of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates. Due to the existence of a singularity at the origin and the absence of tunneling, this one-dimensional system has a twofold degeneracy. Therefore, the nondegeneracy of the eigenvalues breaks down as has been observed in other systems.

This empathic ability can be extended to other species, based on the human ability to develop techniques to understand and communicate with animals. In education, the benefits of training professionals with ethical and empathic tools are known. Gender, diet, past experiences, and other factors can modify a person's levels of empathy toward humans and animals, and a relationship exists between both types of empathy. The aims of this study were to investigate some determinants of the level of empathy and to gain insight into the possible correlation between human-animal and human-human empathy. For this, the Animal Empathy Scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index by Davis were applied through an electronic survey system to freshmen and final-year students (n = 452) from five schools of veterinary medicine in Chile. The correlation between the empathy scores of both instruments and their association with individual factors were studied using Spearman's correlation, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results suggest that both instruments correlate significantly, and that gender, year of study, diet, and area of interest have a significant association with the score for empathy toward animals. This research shows that individual characteristics and changes that occur during veterinary training can affect students' attitudes toward animals.;"[Calderon-Amor, Javiera] Univ Austral Chile, Anim Sci Program, Valdivia, Chile; [Luna-Fernandez, Daniela] Univ Chile, Ciencias Silvoagr & Veterinarias Program, Santiago, Chile; [Tadich, Tamara] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile";;Tadich, T (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile.;tamaratadich@u.uchile.cl;"Tadich, Tamara A/H-9753-2013; Tadich, Tamara/U-6154-2019; Luna, Daniela/H-5312-2013";"Tadich, Tamara A/0000-0003-1620-7770; Tadich, Tamara/0000-0003-1620-7770; Luna, Daniela/0000-0002-7229-3194; Calderon-Amor, Javiera/0000-0003-4183-2260";;;;65;13;14;1;42;UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC;TORONTO;JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA;0748-321X;1943-7218;;J VET MED EDUC;J.

Our surgical educational website and its associated assets were assessed to understand how such a resource was being used. DESIGN: Our website was accessible to all Mayo Clinic employees via the internal web network. Website access data from April 2015 through October 2016 were retrospectively collected using Piwik. SETTING: Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 257 Mayo Clinic employees used the website. RESULTS: The website had 48,794 views from 6313 visits by 257 users who spent an average of 14 11 minutes on the website. Our website houses 295 videos, 51 interactive modules, 14 educational documents, and 7 flashcard tutorials. The most popular content type was videos, with a total of 30,864 views. The most popular visiting time of the day was between 8 PM and 9 PM with 6358 views (13%), and Thursday was the most popular day with 17,907 views (37%). A total of 78% of users accessed content beyond the homepage. Average visits peaked in relation to 2 components of our curriculum: a 240% increase one day before our biannual intern simulation assessments, and a 61% increase one day before our weekly conducted Friday simulation sessions. Interns who rotated on the service of the staff surgeon who actively endorses the website had 93% more actions per visit as compared to other users. The highest clicks were on the home banner for our weekly simulation session pre-emptive videos, followed by groin anatomy, and TEP hernia repair videos. CONCLUSIONS: Our website acted as a just-in-time accessible portal to reliable surgical information. It supplemented the time sensitive educational needs of our learners by serving as a heavily used adjunct to 3 components of our surgical education curriculum: weekly simulation sessions, biannual assessments, and clinical rotations.

DESIGN: Preparatory resources were mailed to match medical students before residency matriculation in 2015. This included how-to videos, low-cost models, and surgical instruments for 5 stations (arterial blood gas analysis, anatomy and imaging knowledge, knot tying ability, and suturing dexterity) of our program's biannual general surgery intern objective assessment activity (Surgical Olympics: total 13 stations, 10 points each). Scores from 2015 were compared with 2014 historical controls in a retrospective manner using the Student's t-test. SETTING: Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. PARTICIPANTS: Postgraduate year 1 general surgery trainees (interns) from the years 2014 and 2015. RESULTS: Twenty-six interns participated in the 2015 assessment and were compared to thirty-two 2014 interns. Overall mean scores were low, but higher (19.7 vs. 15.4, p = 0.04) in the 2015 class. The largest increase was noted in the anatomy knowledge station (mean = 5.0 vs. 1.9, p < 0.01). Scores in stations assessing technical competence were similar to controls. The number of perfect scores among the 5 stations was higher (10 vs. 5) in the 2015 group. Mean scores from the other 8 stations, for which no resources were no difference (29.3 vs. 28.3, p = 0.75).

Whereas most of the debate tends to focus on core contents of nursing programmes, little has been discussed about the teaching in 'supporting subjects' with relevance to both nursing education and nursing practice. This article offers a perspective on sociology scholarship for applied professions by using the case of nursing programmes. Methodology: Syllabus is a rich source of data, and in its representational capacity it becomes both a discursive construction and a vehicle of ideology. Accordingly, we present a Critical Discourse Analysis of syllabi of nursing schools in Chile as to identify core contents and ideologies, and implied challenges for nursing education. Findings and discussion: We argue that while the syllabus as a discourse discloses a significant cleavage, the biggest challenge is precisely to challenge the ideologies constructed by and embedded in the syllabi. Our reflection thus points to a better interdisciplinary dialogue as to enhance the actual contribution of sociology to nursing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the first microscopes of the epoch was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, a deceptively simple device that contains a single ball lens housed in a metal plate allowing the observation of samples at up to x250 magnification. Such magnification was much greater than that achieved by rudimentary compound microscopes of the era, allowing for the discovery of microscopic, single-celled life, an achievement that marked the study of biology up to the nineteenth century. Since Leeuwenhoek's design uses a single ball lens, it is possible to fabricate variations for educational activities in physics and biology university and high school classrooms. A fundamental problem, however, with home-built microscopes is that it is difficult to work with glass. We developed a simple protocol to make ball lenses of glass and gelatin with high magnification that can be done in a university/high school classroom, and we designed an optimized support for focusing and taking photographs with a smartphone. The protocol details a simple, easily accessible, low-cost, and effective tool for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere without the need for a laboratory or complex tools. Our protocol has been implemented in classrooms in Chile to a favorable reception.;"[Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Lab Ontogeny & Phylogeny, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Fdn Interdisciplinary Dev Sci Technol & Arts, DICTA, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Med, MicroMundo Project, Santiago, Chile; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile";;"Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.; Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile.";tim@backyardbrains.com;;Flores, Daniela/0000-0002-8542-0279;"Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant; Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional [2019-21191885]; Chile ANID Project [ACT-1720099]; National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant [2R44 MH-093334]";Funding for the development of this activity was provided by Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant, a national PhD scholarship from the Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional/2019-21191885, Chile ANID Project ACT-1720099, and National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant 2R44 MH-093334: Backyard Brains: Bringing Neurophysiology into Secondary Schools.;;32;1;1;2;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;Rockville;6120 Executive Blvd, Suite 600, Rockville, MD, UNITED STATES;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect and associated factors involved in an intensive course for learning advanced laparoscopic skills, which include validated teaching techniques. METHODS: General surgeons and final-year residents were analyzed after completing an intensive 5-session advanced laparoscopy course. Initial (IA) and final assessment (FA) consisted in performing a jejunojejunal anastomosis in a live porcine model, measured using objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) (GRS and SRS, that is, global rating scale and specific rating scale, respectively) and operative time (OT). The 3-session training was structured in a bench model with an ex vivo bowel. For the demographic analysis, 3 groups were defined according to the presentation of relevant changes in OSATS and in OT between IA and FA: group A, no changes; group B, change in 1 variable; and group C, change in both variables. RESULTS: After the course, all 114 participants presented a significant improvement in OT (37 vs 24.6 min, p < 0.001) and in OSATS; global rating scale (10.5 vs 16 points; p < 0.001) and Specific Rating Scale (8.5 vs 12.7 points; p < 0.001). In the IA, 70 (61%) participants completed the jejunojejunal anastomosis and 105(92%) in the FA (p < 0.01). In the FA, 56% of participants presented relevant changes in both variables (group C). This group was significantly younger (34 vs 45 vs 40 y old; p < 0.001), had fewer years of surgical experience (2 vs 9 vs 5 y; p < 0.001), and had a proportionally higher concentration of residents (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This intensive course is set out as a viable alternative to teach basic skills in advanced laparoscopy in a short period of time, which is ideal for surgeons with difficult access to training centers. It remains necessary to establish the participant profile for which this type of course is most beneficial.

Chilean nursing is considered as the leading example of nursing education in Latin America, demanding a five-year training on a full-time university programme. The consequences of education, however, are assumed as more egalitarian opportunities, disregarding the latent replication of structures that perpetuate inequalities. Objective: To comprehend the socialisation of male nursing students and its relation with their masculine identity and the construction of inequalities in nursing education. Methods: We draw upon interviews undertaken with beginner and advanced nursing students from a Chilean university. Approval was obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee. The data were organised to allow the development of concepts by using the Grounded Theory approach. Results: The analysis uncovers paradoxical results of nursing education and its ineffectiveness in preventing gender-based inequalities. The interest in empowering nursing politically may lead to favour an increasing number of men entering nursing in ways that facilitate male students' progress. Furthermore, there exist discourses of compassion that feed consideration for male students, engendering in the process the prospect of professional success and the gravitation into strategic positions in the employment market. These are mechanisms that reproduce earlier gender-based inequalities in nursing. Conclusions: In the light of the social reproduction theory, the academisation of Chilean nursing seems to be built upon historical gender asymmetries. Although the interest of men in embracing a career in nursing may have a meaningful resonance with the transformation of contemporary society, this process needs a judicious examination in order to protect academic integrity and, ultimately, prevent the reproduction of those inequalities in question. This analysis offers a perspective for understanding social patterns embedded in the practice of nursing education in Chile and elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.;"[De la Fuente, Carlos, I; Guadagnin, Eliane Celina; Kunzler, Marcos Roberto; Carpes, Felipe P.] Univ Fed Pampa, Lab Neuromech, Uruguaiana, Brazil; [De la Fuente, Carlos, I] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Dept Ciencias Salud, Carrera Kinesiol, Santiago, Chile; [De la Fuente, Carlos, I] Clin MEDS, Santiago, Chile";;Carpes, FP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pampa, Lab Neuromech, Uruguaiana, Brazil.;carpes@unipampa.edu.br;"Guadagnin, Eliane C/F-3528-2019; Carpes, Felipe P./A-1069-2010";"Guadagnin, Eliane C/0000-0003-3250-4134; Carpes, Felipe P./0000-0001-8923-4855";;;;15;2;2;2;3;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;1043-4046;1522-1229;;ADV PHYSIOL EDUC;Adv.

Values were analyzed according to age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), environment (rural/urban), and type of school. RESULTSBoys scored higher than girls in aiming and catching, whereas girls aged 6 scored higher than boys in balance. Children living in rural areas and those attending to public schools obtained better scores in aiming and catching than those from urban areas and private schools. The prevalence of DCD was 9.9%, and 7.5% of children were at risk of having movement problems. CONCLUSIONMotor test scores can represent a valuable reference to evaluate and compare the MC in schoolchildren.

They form an increasingly important metric that has been assimilated as a robust proxy measure of quality for evaluating individual, institutional and even system-level performativity. Although the technical design aspects of student ratings have received extensive attention, the broad sociocultural contexts of their use in higher education settings have had considerably less attention. In this study, a meta-synthesis framed by a critical sociocultural perspective was used to investigate the social evolution of student ratings over the last four decades. The outcomes suggest that student ratings have developed through three primary motives: an originating democratic improvement imperative; a dominating quality assurance assimilation and the emerging drive of satisfying the student-as-consumer. This analysis suggests that student ratings cannot be understood only in their benign technical form but must also be considered as performing significant functions in supporting the changing social imperatives of evolving higher education policy.";[Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Darwin, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;sdarwin@uahurtado.cl;"Darwin, Stephen/AAA-5233-2020; Darwin, Stephen/AAS-9549-2020";"Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451; ";Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170314];This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [grant number 11170314].;;62;2;2;3;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

There are few studies about flipped classroom characteristics that could help to improve self-regulation. This study assess the influence of choice in the goal setting process of students and their perception of clear goals while learning in flipped classes, in comparison with lecture based courses in a university-level programming class (n = 299). A method based in the progression mechanism of role playing games is used to help the goal setting process of students in the flipped classroom. Students in flipped classes perceived higher levels of choice in comparison with students in lecture based courses. The effect of choice on achievement was partially mediated by the perception of clear goals of the students and was higher in lower performing students. Our results suggest that the increased perception of choice in the flipped classroom, and their effect in achievement, complement the effect of active learning in the results obtained from flipped classroom use. Instructional designers can use the flipped classroom to provide choices to help the goal setting process of students.;"[Schwarzenberg, Pablo; Navon, Jaime] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Schwarzenberg, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";;"Schwarzenberg, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile.; Schwarzenberg, P (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile.";pablo.schwarzenberg@unab.cl;Navon, Jaime/D-9095-2014;Navon, Jaime/0000-0003-4960-8386;Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [CONICYTPCHA/doctorado Nacional/2013-21130045];This work was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica: [Grant Number CONICYTPCHA/doctorado Nacional/2013-21130045].;;48;0;0;2;21;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

We use experimental variation in children's access to this new ASP to study the impacts on children's grades and school attendance, outcomes that were not specifically targeted by the ASP. While the ASP had no average impact on these academic outcomes, we find heterogeneous treatment effects related to the nature of counterfactual care. Children randomized into the ASP had higher school attendance and higher grades if, initially, they were not supervised by a parent at baseline. The largest positive impacts on school outcomes were found for children who at baseline spent after-school hours at home alone. For this group of counterfactually unsupervised children, the ASP's effect on student attendance persisted one year after ASP enrollment.

This paper analyses the functioning and performance of the tripartite 'participative' Senate of the University of Chile, which includes academics, students and non-academic staff. This paper reveals significant limitations in the functioning, performance and productivity of the Senate, consistent with the evidence reported by the related literature. Our study suggests that these deficiencies are associated with (i) the institutional design and organisation of the Senate, (ii) ambiguity (legal and practical) in respect of its authority, (iii) structural discord with other governing bodies of the university and (iv) lack of legitimacy and recognition of the Senate by other governing bodies and the university community in general, consistent with the observed lack of electoral support and representation of its members.;"[Nunez, Javier; Leiva, Benjamin] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;Nunez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;jnunez@fen.uchile.cl;;;;;;26;2;2;3;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-764X;1469-3577;;CAMB J EDUC;Camb.

Admission regulations are central to understanding issues of school mix, segregation and educational justice. In Chile, student selection has been intensively discussed but scarcely studied. Using a questionnaire for headteachers (N=581), we explore how school admission processes are organised and implemented within a market-based educational system with a high-stakes testing regime where schools are pushed to use selection practices. Despite the existence of a national (although weak) legal prohibition at the time the survey was conducted, half of the headteachers state that they use some mechanism to select students (play sessions, student testing, or interviews with parents) even when they do not face demand pressures. Exploratory data suggest higher levels of selectivity in subsidised private schools. Regression analysis shows a strong association between selectivity' and homogeneous academic intake and social composition. Presumably, the widespread use of selection procedures responds to the structuring force of a double system of educational accountability; strong pressure on performance within a testing regime and where funding depends on enrolments makes selection a fundamental strategy for schools, but which is seriously affecting equality goals.";"[Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Carrasco, Alejandro; Flores, Carolina] Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile; [Gutierrez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile";;"Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile.";ajcarras@uc.cl;;Gutierrez, Gabriel/0000-0002-6477-5783;"FONIDE [711286]; Fondo de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Educacion (FONIDE), Departamento de Estudios y Desarrollo; Division de Planificacion y Presupuesto, Ministerio de Educacion, Chile";This work was supported by FONIDE [grant number 711286].

It first provides some contextual information on the development of Chilean teacher education in the aftermath of the military dictatorship period (1973-1990) and of a research base within its institutions. Then it centres on how future teachers from 11 teacher education programmes report on their learning and growth processes before and after their final practicum, and refer to the contextual effects of school placement on these processes. To this end, questionnaires before and after the practicum experience were administered to an initial group of 152 future teachers and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 of these teachers as well as one observation in their classrooms and schools. The key elements examined were motivation, pedagogical satisfaction and self-efficacy, as well as conditions of practicum and teacher assessment of its effect on learning and commitment to teaching.;"[Avalos, Beatrice] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bascope, Martin] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Avalos, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.;bavalos@terra.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;;;;;36;7;8;0;23;UNISA PRESS;PRETORIA;PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA;1682-3206;1947-9417;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

In particular, the study aims to identify the most important factors related to MCL integration into these practices a year after its implementation. The findings obtained by applying a survey and performing classroom observations show that, although the schools are willing to use this resource, it has been used sporadically for searching information and drilling and practicing contents related to Mathematics and Language, in addition to motivating students. Furthermore, the classroom observations do not reveal any innovative teaching strategies, related to the use of this new technology. The study shows that amongst the main reasons for this traditional and sporadic use of the MCL are a lack of targeted teacher training and preparation time, and insufficient technical and pedagogical support during the phases of implementation and integration to the pedagogical practices.;"[Claro, Magdalena; Nussbaum, Miguel] Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena; Diaz, Anita] Univ Catolica Chile, Eduinnova, Santiago, Chile";;Claro, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"mclarot@uc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; ximelopez@gmail.com; adiaz@eduinnova.com";"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Claro, Magdalena/B-6020-2017";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Claro, Magdalena/0000-0002-2333-6477";;;;36;11;11;0;24;IEEE COMPUTER SOC, LEARNING  TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE;PALMERSTON NORTH;BAG 11-222, MASSEY UNIVERSITY, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND;1436-4522;;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Some argue that school franchises offer educational services more effectively than small independent schools. Skeptics counter that large centralized operations create hard-to-manage bureaucracies and foster diseconomies of scale and that small schools are more effective at promoting higher quality education. We can gain insight into this debate by examining Chile's national voucher program. This paper uses 4th-grade data to compare achievement in private franchises, private independent, and public schools in Chile. Our findings suggest that franchises have a large advantage over independent schools, once student and peer attributes and selectivity are controlled for. We also find that further disaggregating school franchises widens the larger franchise advantage. We conclude that policies oriented to create incentives for private school owners to join or start up a franchise may have the potential for improving educational outcomes.;"[Elacqua, Gregory; Santos, Humberto] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Salazar, Felipe] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Elacqua, G (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.;gregory.elacqua@udp.cl;;Elacqua, Gregory/0000-0003-0066-3640;;;;64;9;9;0;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

It raises critically the issue of impunity (officially declared amnesty for human rights violations) and its consequences for the sense of justice in a process of transition to democracy. The educational implications of this precarious situation are discussed.

Rural schools are more than half of the schools in Chile. This is a qualitative study involving six rural schools in the north, centre and south of the country, with a basis in action research and ethnography. The results show that inclusion has different meanings for different teachers, indicating that passage of the law has not been accompanied by a policy providing clear meanings to guide teaching practices.

In that context, this article tackles the recent equity-oriented reform introduced in the highly marketised Chilean school system. Based on in-depth interviews, we explore the responses of middle-class parents to the implementation of a new centralised admission system that modified the school choice rules. Our findings differentiate five types of responses. Alongside uncovering a significant opposition from parents for whom the reform is experienced as a threat to their middle-classness, we found a variety of stances consistent with heterogeneity within the broader middle class, and we reveal a high ambivalence in their policy interpretations. From these findings, we discuss the sociocultural complexities of reforms aimed at balancing choice and equity, and we contribute to prior literature by unravelling the nuances in the middle-class attitudes towards desegregation policies.;"[Hernandez, Macarena; Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Hernandez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;mihernan@uc.cl;;;"Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile: ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL [21160130]; ANID PIA CIE [160007]";This work was supported by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile: ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2016-21160130, and ANID PIA CIE 160007.;;38;3;3;1;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7925;1469-3623;;COMPARE;Compare;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/03057925.2020.1851592;;DEC 2020;18;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;PB9MN;WOS:000596636500001;;;;;2022-04-06;

The research design was pre-experimental with a pre- and post-test which evaluated improvements in the participants' ability to recognize, analyse and design classroom verbal interaction strategies. The sample was comprised of 124 students at two Chilean universities: one public and one private. After five weeks of implementation, the students' ability to recognize, analyse and design classroom verbal interactions increased significantly, with statistically significant differences by university and specialization but not by sex or socioeconomic level. Noteworthy is a positive relationship between the use of the game outside class and the ability to analyse and design classroom interactions. The students very positively evaluated the training module.

This study aims to investigate from the perspective of school principals (n = 173), the impact of the organizational, relational, and individual dynamics of the New Teaching Career Law. The study employed a mixed-method research design using a descriptive-exploratory approach. The results of this study suggest that the process of teacher sorting considers the following points the most important elements in evaluating a teacher's performance: experience, continuous professional development, and results of the teacher evaluation portfolio.

One teacher and thirty students participated in the study. The teacher was given curriculum materials especially designed to foster argumentation during the teaching of physics. Lessons were videotaped and classroom discourse analysed. The analyses show that the teacher was progressively able to promote argumentation, both in whole-class and group work interactions, from lesson 1: argumentative interactions were increasingly responsive and engaging, and the teacher's group supervision was progressively argumentatively oriented.

Its second objective was to study the relationship among these variables. Three instruments were used to quantify these variables: the Views of the Nature of Science Version D (VNOS D+), the Assessing Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORN), and the Measure of Acceptance of Theory of Evolution (MATE). The results indicate that the PDP had a positive impact on teachers, significantly improving their understanding of the NOS and natural selection, as well as their acceptance of the TE. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the understanding of the NOS obtained by teachers in the first part of the PDP and the understanding and acceptance of evolution that these teachers showed at the end of the programme was determined.

Data obtained through in-depth interviews and focus groups with administrators (N = 51) from 36 schools were analyzed using Wenger's (2000) theory of inter-organizational learning. Findings suggest that an expansion of the roles supervisors and school administrators have traditionally played in the practicum may help reduce this gap. As brokers for their respective institutions they can coordinate actions by gaining access to the meanings each community assigns to practices and acknowledging the competence each brings to the practicum.

Main findings show an overall favorable context for the pedagogical use of ICT in such institutions, in terms of ICT infrastructure, support, policies and teachers' self-reported ICT related skills. In addition, teachers report a quite frequent use of some ICT resources, giving a high importance to students' learning of ICT. However, ICT integration is limited to a few specific resources (mainly computers and projectors), mostly applied to perform traditional pedagogical activities. Therefore, the expectations about the improvement of teaching and learning in Teacher Education in Chile through the integration of ICT, are not been fulfilled yet.

A qualitative design involving was used, which involved a discourse analysis of the Chilean educational policy on integration, and an empirical study in three public municipal schools of one commune. Data were analyzed through pragmatic discourse analysis. Results. The Chilean educational policy is hybrid since it advocates for inclusion from within the logic of human rights, but prescribes a model of integration with a strong psycho-medical emphasis, which operates through individual diagnosis and pedagogical treatment on behalf of the special education teacher. Integration is presented as optional and complementary through the form of school integration projects (SIP) financed through individual vouchers. Local discursive practices translate this policy as a policy for the 'SIP children', that is, those who participate in these projects and, therefore, have a diagnosis and receive additional voucher. These children are labeled and segregated. Responsibility for learning outcomes falls mainly in the hands of the specialized teacher, whose work is encapsulated. Teachers believe that children s learning possibilities depends on the level of disability and family support, a belief that draws the schools away from its pedagogical function. Discussion. From the viewpoint of inclusion, these practices and conceptions create a cultural barrier, since they situate the possibilities of educational change outside the educational scope and outside the regular classroom. This places at risk the possibilities for constructing an educational system with equity.;"[Lopez, Veronica; Julio, Cristina; Morales, Macarena; Rojas, Carolina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Psicol, Vina Del Mar 1290, Chile; [Victoria Perez, Maria] Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Concepcion, Chile";;Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Psicol, Av El Bosque, Vina Del Mar 1290, Chile.;veronica.lopez@ucv.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; López, Verónica/K-5472-2014";"López, Verónica/0000-0001-7405-3859; Morales, Macarena/0000-0002-1624-4873";;;;28;13;38;2;21;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

It builds upon previous research and conceptual frameworks produced by Kember and Kwan (Instr Sci 28(5):469-490, 2000) and Roberts (Instr Sci 31(1-2):127-150, 2003). It advances research on conceptions of, and approaches to, teaching by examining teaching in a novel context: distance-taught courses at the postgraduate level. Lecturers were interviewed from a Faculty of Health Sciences in a research-intensive Australian University. Relationships between conceptions and approaches found in previous research were confirmed in this study. However, it was found that the conceptions of online teaching proposed by Roberts (Instr Sci 31(1-2):127-150, 2003) did not adequately distinguish between the conceptions held by the lecturers interviewed in this study. Three modified conceptions of online teaching are proposed: 'for individual access to learning materials and information; and for individual assessment'; 'for learning related communication (asynchronous and/or synchronous)'; and 'as a medium for networked learning'. Some of the dimensions developed by Roberts to describe approaches to online teaching were not applicable in this study setting and needed further modification. Two broad approaches emerged: 'informative/individual learning focused' and 'communicative/networked learning focused'. Contextual influences on teaching reported by Kember and Kwan (Instr Sci 28(5):469-490, 2000)-that is, institutional influence, nature of students and subject and curriculum-were revealed in this study to have different levels of influence over approaches to online teaching: the first two being the more relevant ones.";Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Gonzalez, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Av Vicuna Mackena 4860, Santiago, Chile.;cgonzalu@uc.cl;González, Carlos/D-7228-2017;González, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777;;;;22;49;49;3;45;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Design/methodology/approach Competing versions of Chilean educators' professionalism during the pandemic were analyzed based on government guidelines, national teachers' association statements, news reports and testimonies from teachers and principals collected from webinars. Findings The guidelines that the ministry issued after school building were required to close motivated educators to challenge a version of professionalism founded on new public management (NPM) policies, which mandated external control and emphasized students' academic outcomes. By challenging the dominant NPM perspective of professionalism, educators advocated for professional autonomy as well as students' and communities' well-being. Originality/value This essay offers insights into how the Chilean school system's response to the crisis evidenced competing notions of educators' professionalism. As the pandemic continues to be an ongoing phenomenon, four implications for reconceptualizing educators' professionalism are drawn, which could inform and offer guidance to practitioners and policymakers in the post-pandemic era.;"[Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Madrid, Romina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Gonzalez, A (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile.;agonzalezt@ncsh.cl;González, Álvaro/ABA-3272-2021;"González, Álvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409; FERNANDEZ COFRE, MARIA BEATRIZ/0000-0001-7639-2811";ANID/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003];The authors wish to acknowledge the insightful comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewer(s) that helped strengthen this manuscript.

An analysis of 1370 papers130 indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection indexes and 1240 indexed in the Scientific Electronic Library Online index (SciELO)indicates that Latin American academics are engaged in lively practices of publication. However, a dual pattern of publication is identified, characterised by researchers extensively publishing in non-mainstream journals and also maintaining a presence in mainstream journals. Issues related to language, rankings and prestige, the North/South divide, the distinction between hard/basic and soft/applied sciences and the nature of higher education studies are used to explain such a pattern. Although there is a tense process of securing a dual epistemic recognition, there is also a positive tension that involves collaboration across a plurality of knowledges. Finally, this paper offers the concept of zones of epistemic influence, which opens spaces for an ecology of knowledges in which knowledges from both the North and the South constitute a new assemblage that accords due weight to a plurality of epistemic interests.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Gomez, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl; carolina.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Gómez-González, Carolina/AAT-1020-2020; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Gomez-Gonzalez, Carolina/0000-0003-0202-085X";"Conicyt-Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170374]; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]";This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1170374 and PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003.

Formative assessment represents a set of student-centered practices, the results of which are not always optimal. Furthermore, different technologies are better suited to certain tasks than to others. The study follows a Design-Based Research approach and was conducted in Chile in two phases. In the first phase of the study, a formative assessment strategy for teaching spelling is developed. In a subsequent phase, the impact of different technologies on this strategy is analyzed. This is achieved by comparing two different technologies: Tablet PCs and the interpersonal computer. The results reveal that a self-paced formative assessment strategy using Tablets is more effective than the same strategy using an interpersonal computer when teaching spelling to primary school students. This therefore highlights the impact of technology on learning when adopting a formative assessment strategy.;"[Vasquez, Andrea; Sciarresi, Enzo; Martinez, Tomas] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Barahona, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Vasquez, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile.;afvasque@uc.cl;"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; wang, xinyi/J-9100-2017";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798";Chile CONICYT-FONDECYT [1150045];The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by Chile CONICYT-FONDECYT grant 1150045.;;68;4;4;1;18;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0735-6331;1541-4140;;J EDUC COMPUT RES;J.

It analyses the state of early career teaching attrition and turnover in Chile over a ten-year period, and goes on more closely to the study of new teacher trajectories over their first two years of teaching. In line with literature on issues of retention/attrition it considers the impact of school conditions and changes in professional satisfaction and self-efficacy perceptions in the early years of teaching. Data sources include econometric analysis of existing databases as well as surveys, interviews and narratives. Quantitative results indicate high attrition rates of early career teachers in Chile, and teacher narratives show critical as well as protective conditions that foreshadow decisions to leave or the stay in the profession.

J;BRUNNER, JJ;;;;BRUNNER, JJ;;;CHILES HIGHER-EDUCATION - BETWEEN MARKET AND STATE;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"Presently, most Higher Education policy issues that are debated in Chilean society revolve around the question of the type of relations that should connect the Higher Education system with the state and society. During the 1980-1990 period, Chilean Higher Education underwent drastic changes under a Military Government, directed to the achieving of three main goals: to open-up the Higher Education system, to differentiate its institutional structures, and to partially transfer the cost of state-financed institutions to the students and/or their families (cost recovery) thus forcing these institutions to diversify their funding sources. As a result of the 1980 reforms, both the institutional composition and the financing of Higher Education experienced dramatic changes. New establishments mushroomed. In tum, the rapid increase in the number of institutions resulted in three major effects: first, Higher Education became private-dominant in the non-university levels and has now a dual public/private nature at the university level; second, establishments grew more regionally dispersed but overall enrolment distribution changed in the direction of a still higher concentration in the capital city; third, creation of new entrance opportunities shows an increasing over-extension with respect to enrolment demand. Also funding of Higher Education was drastically altered by the 1980 reforms. Incremental funding was replaced by a diversified funding system which contemplates the employment of four different mechanisms: public institutional core funding, competitive public allocations rewarding institutions that enrol the best students, a Government financed student-loan scheme, and competitive financing of research projects. A new, democratically elected Government was established in 1990. Its Higher Education policies include three major objectives: to fully restore institutional autonomy cancelling all measures of governmental intervention and reinstating the right of faculty members to freely choose their authorities and provide for the self-government of public universities; to increase public spending without changing the diversified-funding approach adopted by the former Government, and to change the legal framework of Higher Education with the aim of introducing more stringent accreditation and evaluation procedures and institutional accountability.";;;BRUNNER, JJ (corresponding author), FLACSO, LEOPOLDO URRUTIA 1950, CASILLA 3213, CORREO CENT, SANTIAGO, CHILE.;;BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021;Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237;;;;10;7;11;0;22;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Although the problem of underrepresentation of female physicists has several causes, one likely reason is the lower interest that female school students have in physics activities. Several instructional solutions have been proposed to spark girls' interest in physics, including recent ones with mobile devices. However, mobile devices could be problematic technologies for school students and teachers, particularly if guidance in their use is not provided. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of a novel mobile application guided with laboratory reports to increase high school students' interest in physics. We also investigated whether the intervention with mobile laboratory activities facilitated learning about an important physics topic, namely, understanding graphs. The study was conducted in eight eligible schools, totaling data from 268 high school students (57% females). Results showed that all seven measures of self-rated interest in physics received higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. One of the items, which assessed changes in understanding physics, showed greater effects on females than on males. Hence, the instructional mobile application under consideration helped to spark students' interest in physics, and the effect was somewhat greater in schoolgirls, but the intervention did not change the test scores about understanding graphs, failing to demonstrate an association between increased interest in physics and changes in physics educational outcomes. The instructional implications for these findings, as well as limitations and future research directions, are discussed.;"[Carreno, Maria Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gallardo, Maria Jose] Univ Atacama, Sch Med, Copiapo, Chile";;Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"maria.carreno.m01@mail.pucv.cl; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; mariajose.gallardo@uda.cl";Gallardo, María José/ABH-2726-2021;Gallardo-Nelson, Maria Jose/0000-0003-2963-8692;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]; CORFO [16PES-66152]";This study is funded by the ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003, ANID Fondecyt 11180255, and CORFO 16PES-66152.;;53;0;0;9;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

An index of teaching quality was constructed to analyze its variance. It was found that only 4.8% of the variance is explained by the teacher's school. This suggests that the variance in the quality of teaching is not among schools, but within teachers from the same school. These results are important for public policy, especially in the field of professional development, as they suggest that best practices can be found at under-performing schools.;"[Escribano, Rosario; Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Trevino, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Torres Irribarra, David] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Carrasco, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile";;Escribano, R (corresponding author), Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;mdescrib@uc.cl;"Carrasco, Diego/ABE-4483-2020; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302";"National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile, through the project Center of Advanced Studies on Educational Justice [Proyecto CONICYT] [PIA CIE160007]; CONICYT PFCHA/BECA DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2016 [21160063]";This project was funded by the National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile, through the project Center of Advanced Studies on Educational Justice [Proyecto CONICYT PIA CIE160007].

Conversely, the competencies required for the workforce have been slower to emerge. This paper examines the incidence of qualification and skill mismatches across different populations, across age groups, gender, and educational levels. The discrepancy between the qualifications and skills possessed by workers, and those required to perform their jobs is measured using the Survey of Adult Skills-PIAAC and a national socioeconomic survey. Our results suggest that overeducation is increasing across time, affecting mainly younger, higher educated workers. Overskilling is also a widespread phenomenon among this group, probably due to a crowding out process. Moreover, the high competition for accessing the best positions is leading to credential inflation. Thus, the axiom that education per se leads to a good job, which guides much student decision-making, seems increasingly diffuse and requires urgent review.;"[Sevilla, Maria-Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile; [Farias, Mauricio] Fdn Impulso Tek, Santiago, Chile";;Sevilla, MP (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;msevilla@uahurtado.cl;"Sevilla, María Paola/AAH-7102-2019; Farias, Mauricio/D-7759-2013";"Sevilla, María Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272; Farias, Mauricio/0000-0002-9679-4882";;;;31;4;4;1;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7925;1469-3623;;COMPARE;Compare;FEB 17;2020;50;2;;;SI;;276;293;;10.1080/03057925.2019.1675495;;OCT 2019;18;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;KH3GY;WOS:000489974300001;;;;;2022-04-06;

The workshop consisted of stage 1 (7 sessions), stage 2 (video recordings in school classrooms), and stage 3 (3 sessions). The discourses of 8 participating teachers in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and natural science at different educational institutions in the city of Santiago, Chile, were analyzed in this case study. The analysis was carried out by the professors participating in the workshop, based on the participants' identification, initial attempts to address, and proposals to overcome, their obstacles. In the earlier stages of the process, the identified obstacles had procedural characteristics, but as the process advanced, they took on a more epistemological nature. One of the main differences between the initial and final identification of obstacles by the participating teachers is that the latter were more precise and critical, and the teachers increasingly demonstrated the ability to propose specific solutions to teaching problems. Engagement with the obstacles does not take place uniformly but depends on the types of obstacles that the teachers identify in their practice. Proposals for overcoming the obstacles require the teachers to have time for reflecting and validating their ideas in their practice.;"[Joglar, C.; Rojas, S.

Nonetheless, the professional development on becoming a teacher educator has been barely researched. This article reports on a study focused on the professional career path of teacher educators from a situated perspective. The research used in this study employed a mixed-method approach and combined quantitative and qualitative techniques for the purpose of sampling teacher educators from four pre-service Chilean teacher education programs. Data were collected by means of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive analyses and the dialogic discourse analysis method. Results revealed that most teacher educators are characterized as being part of a heterogeneous group, with significant classroom experience shared in common. Furthermore, the findings showed that there was a tendency within this group to focus more on their role as teachers rather than researchers. Additionally, studies also revealed that on the whole this group received little support in their early years as teacher educators. The conclusions drawn gave rise to several suggestions, all of which should be taken into consideration when preparing the next generation of teacher educators.;[Montenegro Maggio, Helena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile;;Maggio, HM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;hlmonten@uc.cl;Montenegro, Helena/P-2372-2017;Montenegro, Helena/0000-0002-0090-3889;;;;65;10;12;1;14;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1941-5257;1941-5265;;PROF DEV EDUC;Prof. Dev.

Specifically, I show how the Research Excellence Frameworks' impact policy in the UK was an object first managed by policymakers but later released as an object of concern for professional academics, including philosophers. I follow 'impact' through texts, events and testimonies about its doings with a special interest in its creation, its polemical encounter with philosophers, its management and issues about its definition and the assessment criteria used and experienced by philosophers. I conclude with some remarks on the effects that the circulation and writing of impact case studies had on producing a social valorisation and attachment to impact, even amongst philosophers.;[Salinas, Francisco J.] Univ Alfonso Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile;;Salinas, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Alfonso Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile.;francisco.salinas.1@edu.uai.cl;;;Universidad Adolfo Ibanez [UAI Postdoctoral Project 2021];"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez [UAI Postdoctoral Project 2021];";;57;0;0;3;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

However, studying critical thinking from the teacher's perspective is key to closing the gap between theory and practice. This study looks to characterize the work done by Spanish-speaking teachers in Latin America to integrate critical thinking into their practice. To do so, an online survey was sent to the participants of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), asking them to describe their work with critical thinking in their classroom. Responses from 278 participantes were then analysed using an exploratory sequential design. During the qualitative phase, a series of categories emerged based on the topics chosen by the teachers, the activities they proposed, and how they linked these to the development of critical thinking. The frequency with which these categories appeared in the teachers' responses was then measured during a subsequent quantitative phase. Variations in these frequencies were also analysed based on the subjects taught by the teachers and the age of the students. The results reveal that teachers primarily try to develop their students' critical thinking skills by integrating them into their subjects; not teaching them separately. Furthermore, they do so by choosing topics that help the students understand the world better from different subject-specific practices. Therefore, when implemented by teachers, critical thinking is highly dependent on the subject. These results suggest that there is a mismatch between educational practice and existing research, which tends to advocate the specific and explicit teaching of critical thinking, whether as a separate subject or through a cross-curriculum approach.";"[Caceres, Martin; Nussbaum, Miguel; Ortiz, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile";;Caceres, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.;mecacere@uc.cl;;; [FONDECYT/CONICYT1180024];This paper had the support of FONDECYT/CONICYT1180024;;72;10;10;8;32;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

Following this line of research, the present study is based in the Mathematics Teacher's Specialized Knowledge (MTSK) model, which includes two domains of knowledge, namely, mathematical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Through an instrumental case study, classroom observation, and a semi-structured interview, we inquire how the knowledge of practices in mathematics, one of the subdomains of mathematical knowledge, is related to the pedagogical content knowledge of a lecturer in a real analysis course. The results show relationships between these subdomains considering their nature of support or conditioning. In this regard, the lecturer's knowledge of practices in mathematics conditions his/her knowledge of mathematics teaching (e.g. techniques, metaphors, and analogies). So, a lecturer's teaching goal is that students, in addition to understanding the mathematical contents, learn how to think mathematically to validate and construct arguments. Additionally, a lecturer's knowledge of students' weaknesses in carrying out proofs and working with quantifiers is supported by his/her knowledge of practice in mathematics (e.g. different methods of proofs and statements with quantifiers, as well as their meaning). In this respect, the nature of relationships between two or three subdomains of the MTSK model contributes to understanding how the lecturer's knowledge is integrated and is a good starting point for investigating the development of lecturers' mathematical and pedagogical knowledge.;"[Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa; Zakaryan, Diana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso, Chile";;Delgado-Rebolledo, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso, Chile.;"rosamdelgadorebolledo@gmail.com; diana.zakaryan@pucv.cl";"Zakaryan, Diana/L-5569-2018; Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa/ABA-9859-2021";"Zakaryan, Diana/0000-0002-3400-8399; Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa/0000-0003-3162-314X";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21170442];The Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Beca de Doctorado ano 2017, folio 21170442 is gratefully acknowledged.;;55;5;5;2;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

By using propensity score methods, we find that attending a Bicentenario school improves students' performance by a range of 0.35 to 0.23 SD in language and 0.5 to 0.35 SD in math. Also, we show that a proportion of this effect is due to the outstanding performance of the new Bicentenario schools as opposed to the restructured version of the program. We prove the robustness of the previous results through falsification, changes-in-changes, and a more demanding control group.

However, there is also evidence that when students discuss their ideas with their peers, the gains are delayed rather than being immediately evident. Moreover, group outcomes do not seem to be related to individual gains. It is hypothesized that peer discussions trigger a metacognitive process that, in turn, prompts the post-collaborative settlement of students' differences. In classroom settings, it is likely that whole-class interaction plays a relevant role, but this has not yet been properly explored. We conducted a case study with the aim of describing how whole-class interaction may contribute to students' knowledge transformation initiated during peer discussions. We followed one group of four students during a whole unit (Forces) and described how progressive small-group and whole-class interactions prompt the transformation of some notions (gravity and magnetic force) from pre- to post-tests, while leaving others almost unchanged. The results suggest that, while rich peer argumentation around contradictory ideas (discussion) followed by repetitive whole-class arguments may contribute to the progressive transformation of scientific ideas, the mere expression of contradictory ideas, involving tangential argumentation and followed by authoritative whole-class corrections but no arguments, only partially leads to changes. The internalization of the whole-class argument facilitated by peer discussions may enable students to reason in new situations.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina; Lopez, Patricia; Moran, Camila] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;"Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231";Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431];This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants no 1140995 and 1170431.;;51;0;0;3;28;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2210-6561;;;LEARN CULT SOC INTER;Learn.

It highlights the need to uncover assumptions and value orientations that are at the basis of these definitions and that tend to guide both conceptualizations and practices about the public role of the universities. It is argued that under neoliberal regimes, the public university takes on private aspects and the private university may even take on public aspects: Universities are here characteristically becoming hybrids.

We used census achievement data that assessed the same cohort of students at the end of 8th and 10th grade. We applied multilevel modelling and calculated correlations between teachers' value-added estimates and their results based on the evaluation system's multiple measures of teaching quality, which include a portfolio of classroom teaching artefacts and a video-taped lesson, a peer interview, supervisor assessments and a self-assessment. Our study finds a medium-size positive relationship between value-added estimates in mathematics and teachers' portfolio results, while relationships with the other instruments are weaker. Correlations are lower for Spanish, but showing a similar pattern across instruments. We also find significant yet weak relationships between value-added estimates and three of six emerging factors of teaching practice based on the evaluation's portfolio data.;"[Taut, Sandy; Valencia, Edgar; Palacios, Diego; Jimenez, Daniela; Manzi, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Santelices, Maria V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Taut, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.;staut@uc.cl;"Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019; Palacios, Diego/F-2243-2015";"Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272; Palacios, Diego/0000-0001-6840-0068";;;;63;9;9;2;25;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0969-594X;1465-329X;;ASSESS EDUC;Assess.

To address the potential bias due to the endogeneity of the competition among schools, an instrumental variable approach is implemented, using instruments associated with the size of each educational market. The results show that an increase of one standard deviation in competition among schools generates a moderate increase in standardized test results (0.06 standard deviations) and a more significant decrease in the other indicators of quality (between 0.02 and 0.16 standard deviations). Therefore, the results suggest a tension in the school between various objectives of educational policy, in which pressure to improve standardized test scores resulting from competition among schools could produce an undesired effect of deterioration in other dimensions of quality.;"[Gajardo, Felipe] Univ Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile";;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.;"fgajardo@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl";;;Center for Conflict and Social Cohesion [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009];The authors would like to thank Alejandra Falabella, Daniel Hojman and Juan Pablo Valenzuela for their comments and suggestions.

The PDP spanned a semester and included activities such as content updates, collaborative lesson planning, and the presentation of planned lessons. In the follow-up part, the lessons were videotaped and analysed, identifying strategies, activities, and conditions based on student learning about the theory of evolution. Data were collected in the first round with an interview before the training process, identifying these teachers' initial content representation (CoRe) for evolution. Then, a group interview was conducted after the lessons, and, finally, an interview of stimulated recall with each teacher was conducted regarding the subject taught to allow teachers to reflect on their practice (final CoRe). This information was analysed by the teachers and the researchers, reflecting on the components of the PCK, possible changes, and the rationale behind their actions. The results show that teachers changed their beliefs and knowledge about the best methods and strategies to teach evolution, and about students' learning obstacles and misconceptions on evolution. They realised how a review of their own practices promotes this transformation.;"[Bravo, Paulina; Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile";;Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;hernan.cofre@ucv.cl;;, hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X;Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [N 1131029];This work was supported by Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), Grant [N 1131029 to HC].;;55;13;14;3;37;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

This paper studies the relationship between the secondary school track attended by Chilean students (vocational or academic) and their subsequent outcomes in access to and persistence in postsecondary vocational programs. Although it is expected that vocational students will display lower access to higher education programs, due to their less intense curriculum and the generally non-academic environment of their schools, their performance in post-secondary vocational programs is unclear. Field-specific knowledge and vocational maturity could improve the performance of students from secondary vocational education backgrounds. Our analysis uses propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and determine causal relationships. It also utilizes sensitivity analysis to check for the robustness of results. The findings reveal that, indeed, vocational students have lower rates of access and persistence than academic ones. Students who change fields between secondary and postsecondary education have the lowest persistence levels. We also found that vocational students have lower probabilities of access to higher education funding, and higher probabilities of enrolling in evening classes. Thus, when controlling for these two characteristics, we found that students who continue in the same vocational field between secondary and postsecondary levels had a better performance than students with an academic background. These findings may suggest that vocational students require greater support in order to increase their probabilities of success in higher education.;"[Farias, Mauricio] Superintendence Educ Chile, Inspecting Div, Santiago, Chile; [Paola Sevilla, Maria] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Farias, M (corresponding author), Superintendence Educ Chile, Inspecting Div, Santiago, Chile.;"mauricio_farias@yahoo.com; paola.sevilla@gmail.com";"Sevilla, María Paola/AAH-7102-2019; Farias, Mauricio/D-7759-2013";"Sevilla, María Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272; Farias, Mauricio/0000-0002-9679-4882";CONICYT, Programa de Insercion de Capital Humano Avanzado [781204034];We thank the data provided by the Centro de Estudios from the Ministry of Education-Chile.

We found that mathematics anxiety can negatively influence pre-service teachers' expectations about students, and that future mathematics teachers' expectations of mathematics achievement are lower for girls than for boys. These effects are independent, as we did not find significant interaction effects between pre-service teacher's mathematics anxiety and student gender. Our results also suggest that mathematics anxiety could affect the capacity of pre-service teachers to develop inclusive learning environments in their classrooms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes the barriers school administrators from Chile identified for their schools' involvement in the practicum scheme. Data were produced through a survey (N=172) and in-depth interviews (N=51) with administrators in schools hosting teacher candidates. Few participants (4%) identified barriers implicating a sense of shared school-university responsibility for the success of the practicum. About a third of the barriers identified pertain to within school factors, such as teachers' and parents' reluctance to host candidates. From these administrator's perspectives, a distance with the host school is produced through a number of factors attributed to the universities' curricula and management. Administrators manage this distance to leverage better learning opportunities for their school's pupils, for prospective teachers, and for the school staff. Findings contribute to the discussion of policies and practices to strengthen school-university partnerships, highlighting the importance of including school administrators as key contributors.

J;Richards, H;;;;Richards, Howard;;;Unbounded organisation and the future of socialism;EDUCATION AS CHANGE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"accumulation; Alexander; central planning; Marxism; social democracy; socialism";;This article starts with the question whether the socialism Neville Alexander advocated is a thing of the past or a prospect for the future. It considers two forms of 20(th)-century socialism, the centrally planned economy and social democracy, in the light of Marx's concept of accumulation. Accumulation' names both the logic of capitalism and the dynamic that drives it. A focus on the need to deal with the probability that the accumulation dynamic will falter in the process of moving from capitalism to socialism helps to explain socialism's decline. Unbounded organisation' is introduced as a broader concept that includes the bounded' social organisation that frames capitalism and its accumulation dynamic as a special case. It helps to both explain the decline of socialism and to suggest how to reverse that decline. It is suggested that the socialism of the future can best be defined not as a certain form of social organisation, but rather as the power of the people to choose the set of economic and other institutions that works best for them. Three of Alexander's contributions to building an unbounded socialism are found in his proposals for grass-roots organising at the neighbourhood level, in his promotion of multilingualism, and in his advocacy of alternative education.;Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile;;Richards, H (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile.;howardri00@yahoo.com;;;;;;61;2;2;0;58;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1682-3206;;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

J;Bernasconi, A;;;;Bernasconi, A;;;University entrepreneurship in a developing country: The case of the P. Universidad Catolica de Chile, 1985-2000;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Entrepreneurial University; higher education Chile; higher education Latin America; mode 2 knowledge production; organizational change; private higher education; privatization of higher education; second academic revolution; Triple Helix";"INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS; PRIVATE HIGHER-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; TRIPLE-HELIX; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS";Privatization in higher education is usually understood either as the surge of private institutions or as universities' growing reliance on private sources of funding or otherwise operating more like firms. Joining the growing literature on university entrepreneurship, this is a case study on the less examined problem of entrepreneurial universities in developing countries. In a period of roughly 15 years, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Chile, founded in 1888, turned itself from a mostly teaching institution to a research-oriented university, responsible for one-fourth of the Chile's mainstream scientific output and 40% of all Ph.D.s awarded nationally. Yet, public funding represents today only 17% of its revenues, down from almost 90% in 1972. How such academic development could have occurred as the State withdrew and the market took hold of Chilean higher education after the reforms introduced by the military rule of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) is the theme of this work. Universidad Catolica's policies and strategies are described, and the factors contributing to its success, together with their limitations, identified. The case suggests that orientation to the market can be more a means for survival and growth under the pressure of privatization, than a result of a 'Triple Helix' strategy of universities, government and industry to generate innovation out of academic knowledge. Secondly, while in the industrialized world, higher education entrepreneurship is associated with knowledge production for economic development ('Mode 2'), entrepreneurial universities in the context of developing countries may just be finding their way to the academic, disciplinary mode of research.;Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.;abernasconi@utalca.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;47;36;39;0;64;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;;;HIGH EDUC;High.

This pandemic has emphasized the need to improve the teaching process through the use of innovating educational tools, such as mobile augmented reality (mAR). This pilot study intends to evaluate the relationship between motivation and meaningful learning for university students through mAR, as well as the effects and implications of its use how supporting teaching activities in an Industrial Design and Technical Drawing course. A quantitative method research approach was applied to collect, process, and analyze the research data of the students' perception under the health restrictions caused by the current pandemic, using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS). The total number of questionnaires collected was 96, applied to students of the Industrial Engineering major at Universidad Catolica del Maule in Chile. The instrument's reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha, giving an overall value of 0.89. The implementation of an instructional model called ARCS (Attention-Relevance-Confidence-Satisfaction) was achieved. The implementation of mRA was positively valued by most of the students surveyed. An increase the percentage of students who achieved the expected learning objectives was found, in compared to previous versions of the course (without mAR). Finally, the results demonstrate a positive relation between mAR and the learning level achieved by students. There was no evidence of negative effects under the particular imposed conditions, because of sanitary restrictions when implementing the mAR.;[Laurens-Arredondo, Luis] Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Chile;;Laurens-Arredondo, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Chile.;llaurens@ucm.cl;;Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/0000-0002-2140-6275;;;;69;0;0;8;8;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1360-2357;1573-7608;;EDUC INF TECHNOL;Educ.

The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers' self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers' self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers' report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher's professional development.;"[Saadati, Farzaneh] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio; Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Santiago, Chile";;Saadati, F (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"farzaneh.saadati@gmail.com; chandiaeugenio7@gmail.com; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl";;Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075;"CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673, PAI AFB-170001]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral Project 3170673, Grant PAI AFB-170001, PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.;;60;0;0;7;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1386-4416;1573-1820;;J MATH TEACH EDUC;J.

That is, we compare the performance of girls versus boys within schools with single-sex classrooms compared to the performance of girls versus boys within schools with coeducational classrooms, using a difference-in-difference approach with school fixed effects. In line with the results of the previous literature that has found positive effects for female students, we find that coeducational schools with single-sex classrooms reduce the math gender gap by more than half. The effect is consistent with an increase in the math achievement of female students with no decrease in the achievement of male students. Finally, this effect is not driven by teacher characteristics or student-teacher gender matching, but it seems to be driven by how female students respond to the gender composition of the classroom.;"[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile";;"Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile.";vparedes@fen.uchile.cl;;;"Fondecyt InicioComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170968]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009]; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [NCS17_015]";This work was supported by Fondecyt Inicio [Project 11170968], the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009], and ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Code: NCS17_015.;;49;0;0;7;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1934-5747;1934-5739;;J RES EDUC EFF;J.

A particular issue is that of the presence of peripheral regions such as Latin America. The focus here is research into higher education reforms and, by using bibliometrics, a word frequency analysis and a thematic analysis, patterns of publication and themes in two different academic datasets - the global Web of Science and the more regional SciELO - are examined. Although the configuration of knowledge production on higher education reforms is seen as relatively homogeneous in certain respects, separate circuits of knowledge production are also revealed and even within a region (here, Latin America). Higher education reform is posed differently according to the publication circuits of journals and their position in global knowledge markets. A geopolitical imbalance in knowledge production is revealed and it is suggested that different regions of the world possess distinctive epistemic identities. The paper concludes by suggesting that there is room for negotiation between the different zones of epistemic influence.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Rios-Jara, Hector] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Queupil, Juan] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile";;"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.";carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"Conicyt-Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170374]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds [FB0003]";This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1170374.

Becoming the 'good' early childhood practitioner in Chile;GENDER AND EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Vocation; professional identity; gender; performativity; early childhood education";"TEACHERS; CARE; PROFESSIONALISM; WOMEN; WORK; HOPE";In this paper, I discuss how professional identities in early childhood education in Chile are performatively constituted within the interplay between a religious discourse of vocation and gender. 'Having the vocation' has become a regime of truth that regulates and governs educators' behaviours, motivations and relationships in their workplace. By deconstructing the concept of vocation through a poststructuralist and feminist theory, I show the arising tensions in this discourse, emphasising that it positions female early childhood educators as a subject of both exploitation and admiration. Vocation shapes early years practitioners not only as nurturing and caring, but deeply altruist, devoted and self-sacrificed women seeking (eternal) salvation. Exposing the contradictory nature of this discourse, the article highlights its tensions with the professionalization of the early years workforce. Whilst vocation situates practitioners as good educators and morally good women, it allows for workforce exploitation, trapping them in hazardous working conditions.;[Poblete Nunez, Ximena] Univ Andres Bello, Psychol Dept, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile;;Nunez, XP (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Psychol Dept, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile.;xpoblete@cepinfancia.cl;"Nuñez, Ximena Poblete/AAZ-3168-2021; Nuñez, Ximena Poblete/Z-1505-2019";"Nuñez, Ximena Poblete/0000-0002-8604-1473; ";;;;54;1;1;1;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0954-0253;1360-0516;;GENDER EDUC;Gend.

In massive courses where there are a variety of activities, automated analysis techniques are required in order to process the large volume of information that is generated, to help teachers take timely and appropriate actions. In these scenarios, it is convenient to classify students into a small number of groups that can receive dedicated support. Using only online activity to group students has proven to be insufficient to characterize relevant groups, because of that this study proposes to understand differences in online activity using differences in course status and learning experience, using data from a programming course (n = 409). The model built shows that learning experience can be categorized in three groups, each with different academic performance and distinct online activity. The relationship between groups and online activity allowed us to build classifiers to detect students who are at risk of failing the course (AUC = 0.84) or need special support (AUC = 0.73), providing teachers with a useful mechanism for predicting and improving student outcomes.;"[Schwarzenberg, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile; [Navon, Jaime; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Schwarzenberg, P (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile.;"pablo.schwarzenberg@unab.cl; jnavon@uc.cl; mar.perez@uc.cl";Navon, Jaime/D-9095-2014;Navon, Jaime/0000-0003-4960-8386;;;;33;3;3;0;28;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1042-1726;1867-1233;;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

To do so, the article begins by arguing that the university becomes part of the Enlightenment and accesses to modernity when the Faculty of Philosophy ceases to be conceptualized as the handmaiden of the Faculty of Theology (philosophia theologiae ancilla) and grows to be understood as the mistress' torchbearer, as ironically remarked by Kant. In the following decades, the new role that philosophy adopts in the division of academic labor changes the relationship of the institution with both the political and religious powers, opening the door on the road to the nation state and, further down, to the subordination of its activities to global academic capitalism. Consequently, traditional normative referents, as those proclaimed by Kant and Humboldt where universities were conceived as responsible for the evolution of modern society, lose plausibility and are subjected to the criticism of ideologies. The article concludes by examining future trends in education and research conducted in contemporary universities and by arguing that the crisis of the modern idea of the university is, in fact, an expression of its modern character that now turns against this very institution.;"[Joaquin Brunner, Jose; Labrana Vargas, Julio Roberto] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Ciencias Desarrollo, Osorno, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Programa Invest Gobernanza & Inclus Org, Osorno, Chile; [Rodriguez-Ponce, Emilio] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile";;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile.;"josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com; Julio.LabranaVargas@uni-wh.de; fganga@ulagos.cl; erodriguez@uta.cl";"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021; Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/AAV-2527-2021";Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/0000-0001-9325-6459;;;;67;10;13;4;12;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Four university forms are identified, analysed and illustrated, namely the expert university, the non-elite university, the entrepreneurial university and the revolutionary university. It is suggested that the typology and the analysis of university forms offered here provide insight into the current positioning of universities in relation to the wider world and have potential in prompting new forms of university for the twenty-first century. The paper further advances another possible university for the future, namely the complex university. The complex university is part of and respectful of diverse ecosystems. It creates new frameworks to understand the world and, in that way, supports social transformations.;[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile CIAE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile CIAE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"CONICYT-ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); FONDECYT projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11110102, 1141271]; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; Proyecto de Mejoramiento Institucional U.of Chile (PMI-UCH) [1501]";"This work was supported by CONICYT-Chile, FONDECYT project 11110102 and FONDECYT project 1141271; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project BF0003; and Proyecto de Mejoramiento Institucional U.of Chile (PMI-UCH) 1501.";;58;6;6;2;15;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0013-1857;1469-5812;;EDUC PHILOS THEORY;Educ.

J;Infante, M;;;;Infante, Marta;;;Cinema experiences at school: assemblages as encounters with subjectivities;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Difference; inclusive education; visual studies; assemblages";"PEDAGOGY; MATTERS";The aim of this article is to analyse how 15 students at a public elementary school detach from immobile representations of identity through aesthetic self-expressive work with cinema. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's concept of assemblage, I interrogate students' experiences of discrimination and challenge their processes of developing a short film within cinema workshops at school. I find that when new components regarding cinema, such as material apparatuses (e.g. cameras, stages, sound recorders) and expressive devices (e.g. improvisation, dialogues, corporeal movements), are applied to both the school and subjectivities, there is a rupture of rigid systems of representation and the creation of novel assemblages.;[Infante, Marta] Pontificia Univ Catolia Chile, Learning & Dev, Santiago, Chile;;Infante, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolia Chile, Learning & Dev, Santiago, Chile.;minfantj@uc.cl;Infante, Marta/B-2097-2017;Infante, Marta/0000-0003-0295-1478;National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130616];This work was supported by National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development, FONDECYT [grant number 1130616].;;32;2;2;0;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

It critically analyzes the university reform in Latin America dominated by the thought and practice promoted by various international financial institutions (such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB]) beginning in the 1980s and then looks at the feasibility of an alternative Freirian view. The work of Paulo Freire celebrated the liberating role that public university education should play in the training of citizens and professionals, that is with a critical and ethical conscience, committed to the needs of the locality, region and the world. All this is in clear opposition to what has happened to Latin American universities, influenced by neo-liberal reforms over the last decades.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Santiago, Chile";;"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Santiago, Chile.";oespinoza@academia.cl;;;;;;52;7;7;1;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7240;1465-3877;;J MORAL EDUC;J.

This paper draws on the experiences of 16 5-to 7-year-old children, transitioning from kindergarten to first grade in Chile as reported by them through visual participatory research. Integral to the ethical principles were the use of a visual participatory design, a listening framework and the child's rights perspective. In order to be faithful to the research design proposed, different ethical guidelines were revised and followed to ensure protection, anonymity, the right to withdraw and privacy to the children deciding to get involved in the research process. Essential to this work was recognising the child as the most knowledgeable agent in her/his own experiences in order to minimise issues of power and increase children's awareness during the data collection process. Findings from the study demonstrate different situations in which the researcher's selfreflexivity can enhance positive outcomes related to ethical issues and young children's ability to understand the research process, communicate meanings and jointly create new meanings through the tools provided and activities proposed.

In this multi-session experiment, third grade students working on arithmetic exercises from various curricular units were divided into three groups. The first group used personal computers (netbooks), the second group used an interpersonal computer (ie, one projector with a screen, one computer and one mouse per child) and the third group used pen-and-paper. The results of the experiment indicate that all three groups achieved an increase in learning, as shown by the pretest and posttest scores. No significant difference was found between the interpersonal computer and personal computer groups. This suggests that the key characteristic shared by the two groups is the provision of feedback. The format that such feedback takes, either private (through a personal screen) or public (through a shared screen), is shown to make no difference. However, the results significantly favour groups that are provided with instant feedback (interpersonal computer and personal computer) as opposed to delayed feedback (pen-and-paper).;"[Tagle, Arturo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Master Sci Engn, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Diaz, Anita] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Infante, Cristian] San Luis Beltran School, Santiago, Chile";;Alcoholado, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 4860, Chile.;cfalcoho@puc.cl;Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983;"Microsoft Research; FONDECYT-CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1100309, 1120177]";This work was partially funded by Microsoft Research and FONDECYT-CONICYT 1100309 and 1120177.;;19;5;5;2;17;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Students criticized the privatization of higher education and the multiple flaws of this sector, which included corruption scandals during the process of quality assurance certification. After the end of the movement, the government announced a new quality assurance system, triggering public discussion over this issue in the media. The most influential newspapers and educational authorities participated actively in this debate. Through editorials and columns, these education agents constructed quality assurance discursively as a domain for experts, who have to design and administer quality standards for all educational institutions and actions. These procedures regulate and discipline educational practices, but professors and students are excluded from this debate. Thus, this quality assurance discussion reproduces the traditional neoliberal power relations in education and does not problematize the role of education in society.;Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile;;Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile.;ccabalin@uchile.cl;Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014;Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478;;;;45;7;8;2;33;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-8487;1750-8495;;CRIT STUD EDUC;Crit.

Using framing theory, this article presents a critical discourse analysis on the editorials published about the 2011 student movement by El Mercurio, the most influential newspaper in Chile. El Mercurio is more than a newspaper. It is an institution; an institution that supports conservative ideas. El Mercurio framed the public discussion about educational policies and defended neoliberal education based on three discourses: the neoliberal system is absolute, public education is valued less than private and education is a technical issue, not political. By invoking this rhetoric strategy, these discourses attempted to maintain the neoliberal education system in Chile, which in turn rejected the social struggles of the student movement.";Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile;;Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile.;ccabalin@uchile.cl;Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014;Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478;;;;44;17;21;0;25;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0159-6306;1469-3739;;DISCOURSE-ABINGDON;Discourse;OCT;2014;35;4;;;;;485;498;;10.1080/01596306.2013.871233;;;14;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;AM8MW;WOS:000340130900002;;;;;2022-04-06;

In this article I want to problematise the authoritative regulatory discourse of policies on international students in the United States (US) particularly after 9/11/2001 and how they maintain an essentialising notion of identity. Starting from this analysis I want to argue for the reframing of international students as co-producers of knowledge by questioning the more pragmatic sense of what internationalising higher education means. In the process I raise a range of relevant questions such as the ways policies are forms of cultural production condition experience, interpretation and reality (Campbell, 2000, 34). This has emerged from my doctoral dissertation in which I was located as an international student. This experience made me question how the subjectivity of international students is posited in policy documents and research in the United States.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Matus, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile.;;Matus, Claudia/A-6840-2017;Matus, Claudia/0000-0002-9180-8237;;;;20;2;2;1;11;PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION;PRETORIA;UNIV PRETORIA, GROENKLOOF CAMPUS, FACULTY EDUCATION, PRETORIA 0002, SOUTH AFRICA;0258-2236;;;PERSPECT EDUC;Perspect.

As a result, the role of principals has become increasingly challenging and stressful, having a negative impact on principals' attraction and retention, job satisfaction as well as their mental and physical health. This paper explores how a group of 21 Chilean school principals working in the Valparaiso Region experience stress, based on individual semi-structured interviews about their subjective experiences in their role. Findings suggest that principals consider their work to be challenging, associated with several demanding situations in their schools which contribute to feeling stress. Stressors identified by principals can be organized into three groups: work-related, such as dealing with bureaucratic pressures and lack of support from municipal authorities; relationship-related, such as managing relations with a wide range of school actors and the emotional burden of interacting with them; and time-related, such as being always available to solve problems and feeling isolated in this task.";"[Aravena, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Cardenal Raul Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile";;Aravena, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;"felipe.aravena@pucv.cl; agonzalezt@ucsh.cl";González, Álvaro/ABA-3272-2021;González, Álvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409;;;;63;0;0;1;1;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0738-0593;1873-4871;;INT J EDUC DEV;Int.

One of Chile's largest higher education institutions, which has an important number of mature students from more deprived social sectors, was used as a case study. A quantitative methodology was applied, based on the estimation of logistic regression models, where freshmen dropout rates were defined as the dependent variable and three types of independent variable were considered: family/demographic conditions, socio-economic situation and institutional structures. The results indicate that students who are parents, have a job, are not the heads of their households, are enrolled in longer programmes and who attended adult high school are more likely to drop out of higher education during their first year of study. Suggestions for institutional practices to better integrate mature students into higher education are discussed.;[Venegas-Muggli, Juan I.] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Dept Inst Anal, Santiago, Chile;;Venegas-Muggli, JI (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Dept Inst Anal, Chancellors Off, Ave Vitacura 10151, Santiago, Chile.;jvenegasm@inacap.cl;Venegas-Muggli, Juan Ignacio/AAE-8612-2019;Venegas-Muggli, Juan Ignacio/0000-0003-4608-1865;;;;51;1;1;1;35;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0158-037X;1470-126X;;STUD CONTIN EDUC;Stud.

This scenario requires professionals with practical experience. While students and new graduates often gain practical experience through internships or part-time jobs, universities can play an active role in developing the required student skills. Within this context, instruction aimed to promote learning based solely on memorization as a mechanism to ensure cognitive sufficiency is certainly outdated. Simulation-based training (SBT), an active learning methodology, is the approach used in this study. Both surveys and focus groups were performed to assess the impact of SBT on the students' learning process to understand how productive processes affect business profitability.

To date, few studies have examined how touchscreen devices may influence primary school students' reading and writing practices. Guided by Vygotsky's notion of co-construction and aspects of the New London Group's multiliteracies framework, we built an original multimodal tablet tool and examined how 51 third graders in Costa Rica used it to co-construct and design meaning in a reading-to-writing activity. The first aim of this study, therefore, is to understand how multimodality and technology can work together to support young people's reading and writing. Secondly, we asked how a specific interactive, touchscreen feature might positively contribute to third graders' writing samples. The key findings were that the tool used in this study encouraged a broad range of writing practices, that the touch feature supported co-construction, and that the careful integration of touchscreen features can engage and motivate students in reading and writing activities.;"[Cordero, Kristina; Nussbaum, Miguel; Ibaseta, Valentina; Jose Otaiza, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Escuela Ingn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Letras, Santiago, Chile";;Cordero, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Escuela Ingn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;kcordero@uc.cl;Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983;"LACCIR Latin American and Caribbean Collaborative ICT Research Federation [R1212LAC003]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Fondecyt 115045]";"LACCIR Latin American and Caribbean Collaborative ICT Research Federation, Grant/Award Number: R1212LAC003; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: Fondecyt 115045";;94;6;6;2;40;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

The study estimated the magnitude and evolution of the SES segregation of schools at both national and local levels, and it studied the relationship between some local educational market dynamics and the observed magnitude of SES school segregation at municipal level. The main findings were: first, the magnitude of the SES segregation of both low-SES and high-SES students in Chile was very high (Duncan Index ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 in 2008); second, during the last decade, SES school segregation tended to slightly increase in Chile, especially in high schools (both public and private schools); third, private schools - including voucher schools - were more segregated than public schools for both low-SES and high-SES students; and finally, some market dynamics operating in the Chilean education (like privatization, school choice, and fee-paying) accounted for a relevant proportion of the observed variation in SES school segregation at municipal level. These findings are analyzed from an educational policy perspective in which the link between SES school segregation and market-oriented mechanisms in education plays a fundamental role.";"[Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [de los Rios, Danae] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile.;cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Bellei, Cristián/D-9921-2015";Bellei, Cristián/0000-0001-6963-7809;;;;96;179;210;4;75;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

The study analyses and discusses the ideas regarding the emergence of a new generation of learners, or digital natives, as characterised by wide-ranging access to digital media and by having new skills and abilities. In-depth interviews held with students and teachers from four different cities in the country are analysed. The data shows evidence of a generation of learners without shared traits, with segments of learners presenting practices that do not characterise the entire generation. In addition, the data shows that the skills and abilities described in the literature do not represent a precise description of those that the students exploit when using technology. Beyond the ability to work simultaneously on several tasks, some learners have the ability to manage the attention that they pay to their work on the computer in sophisticated ways, and although some prefer images to words on paper, among others, there is still a taste for reading actual printed books. All in all, students and teachers describe a certain distance and conflict between the practices with the use of ICTs and their everyday school experiences.;"[Sanchez, Jaime] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 2777, Chile; [Contreras, David; Meyer, Eduardo] Pontificial Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Sanchez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago 2777, Chile.;jsanchez@dcc.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Salinas, Alvaro/F-9959-2012";Salinas, Alvaro/0000-0001-9655-761X;;;;19;26;30;0;21;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

We contend that the use of discourses of diversity, as reproducing the separation between mainstream subjectivities and those uncontained by the category of normal, is one of the ways universities align themselves with the rules of a democratic society, based on ideas of multicultural understandings and tolerant communities proliferated by inter-governmental institutions such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and others. Our interest is to question the marginalization of cultural politics through the intensification of these discourses. At the same time, we explore the relations between the advancement of neutral discourses of difference and the value-free practices expressed in neoliberal educational agendas.

The interaction and collaboration between participants allows students to exchange information, test their understanding and reflect on what they have learned. Given the promising results of using MMORPG technologies for educational purposes, this paper translates the multiplayer role playing game (MRPG) aspect, the essential concept behind MMORPGs, into the classroom context. We present the abstraction behind a Classroom Multiplayer Presential Role Playing Game (CMPRPG) and the development of a CMPRPG for teaching ecology. The game has a quest structure in which each result highlights a key teaching objective. It is implemented at a high level, with interaction between reusable game elements defined using triggers. It is observed that the implemented CMPRPG has appropriate usability levels, benefits the learning and application of the concepts of ecology and, in the interactive dimensions, it encourages participation and collaborative narrative structures among participants.;"[Susaeta, Heinz; Jimenez, Felipe; Nussbaum, Miguel; Gajardo, Ignacio; Jose Andreu, Juan; Villalta, Marco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ciencia Computac, Santiago, Chile";;Susaeta, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ciencia Computac, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;mn@ing.puc.cl;"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Villalta, Marco/B-9555-2012";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Villalta, Marco/0000-0002-7553-925X";;;;41;33;34;0;27;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNKIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

To address this issue, we use a measure of competition that captures three major characteristics of market competition in a spatial context: the number of competitors, based on distance buffers; the size of competitors, measured by the enrollment of voucher schools; and the geographical distance among public schools and their competitors. To control for the potential endogeneity of our measure of spatial competition on public schools' efficiency, we use an instrumental variable based on the discontinuites generated by admissions municipality boundaries . We do not find evidence that public schools' efficiency increases or decreases as the result of the increment of voucher schools located near to public schools, an increase in the enrollment of existing voucher schools, or both factors simultaneously. This result is robust to: (1) the limit of education market or other measures of spatial competition; (2) the methodology used to compute the efficiency measures; and (3) whether we explain efficiency or educational performance.";"[Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo; Cortes, Yasna] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile; [Sarrias, Mauricio] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile";;Quintero-Fragozo, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile.;camilo.quintero@alumnos.ucn.cl;Sarrias, Mauricio/L-7627-2018;Sarrias, Mauricio/0000-0001-5932-4817;;;;91;0;0;3;3;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face with twenty-four teacher educators working in three Chilean primary school teacher education programs. The analysis identified four categories of description, ranging from modeling as teaching pedagogical activities to modeling as developing teaching linked to the school classroom. Besides, four dimensions of variation were found, providing a more accurate picture of this teaching practice. We recommend continuing the study on this topic for improving the teaching practices enacted by teacher educators. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on discourse analysis of two Chilean higher education policy reports, we examine the reconfiguration of the dimensions of the public and the private and identify three discursive prerequisites for the naturalisation of neoliberalism in Chilean higher education: first, the silencing of the dictatorial origins of the system; second, the idea of neutrality as a means to present public and private higher education as if they were equal; and third, the role of social democracy in a 180 degrees' inversion of meanings of the public and the private.

A formalization in affordances of design process may help overcome said issues and enhance product effectiveness, by identifying and highlighting potential designers' workload perception during the Product Development Process. In this scenario, this paper describes an approach for continuously monitoring and measuring the complexity of design process during the creation of a new product. After an overview of the related work, this study proposes a common instructional design model for Product Development Process, which was split in order to be measured by using NASA-TLX. This research propose that the use of NASA-TLX to predict and measure the designer workload during the design process contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among the different design phases and designer workload.

However, not all ICT usage models are designed to affect student outcomes. Therefore, to accurately study the impact of ICT, the concept of an educational programme supported by ICT must first be defined. The authors propose the ICT for Education (ICT4E) programme, an evidence-based framework to determine a model's ability to produce improvements before having to evaluate its results. The framework has four components: implementation, intervention, transference and total cost. Based on an explicit definition of the outcomes pursued by a given programme, this framework supports the design of its activities to promote sustainable changes in pedagogical practices in schools and calculate the programme's total cost. The authors illustrate this with a programme implemented in six countries. In Chile, the ICT4E programme forms part of the policy for educational technology, evaluating the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives.;"[Rodriguez, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Dombrovskaia, Lioubov] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Informat, Santiago, Chile";;Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;prodriguez@ciae.uchile.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Rodríguez, Patricio/F-8606-2015";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Rodríguez, Patricio/0000-0002-7361-5132";;;;113;15;16;1;55;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1475-939X;1747-5139;;TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC;Technol.

Strategies to prevent dropout are ineffective and dropout rates not only don't drop but tend to increase. The case of Chile is used in this article as a reference to analyse the weaknesses and faults of implemented policies and alternative policy options recommended as promising by the literature are discussed. They are based on the decentralization of responsibilities and decisions to the local level administration and on the coordinated action of all stakeholders involved, including communities and families.

Using the Anthropological Theory of Didactics (Chevallard, 1999) and the Theory of Didactic Situations (Brousseau, 1990). the investigation began with the nuclear mathematical learning and contents of the current official elementary school programs in mathematics. Then, it continued with the observation and analysis of teaching-learning processes developed for arithmetics in elementary schools in the Metropolitan Region and ended with the analysis of the institutional restrictions imposed by schools for the development of those processes. We identified the phenomenon of the progressive inhibition of some mathematical abilities of students through elementary school. The students not only stop learning vital mathematical subjects for their academic and cognitive development at a timely curricular moment, but also a progressive stagnation in their development abilities is caused, especially during the second basic cycle.;"[Espinoza, Lorena] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Matemat, Santiago, Chile; [Barbe, Joaquin; Galvez, Grecia] Univ Santiago Chile, Grp Felix Klein, Santiago, Chile";;Espinoza, L (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Matemat, Santiago, Chile.;"lorespinoz@gmail.com; quimbarbe@gmail.com; grecia.galvez@gmail.com";"espinoza, lorena/I-2215-2015; Barbe, Joaquim/Q-5419-2017";"espinoza, lorena/0000-0002-8752-3423; Barbe, Joaquim/0000-0002-7260-5178";;;;15;2;5;0;2;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;BARCELONA;SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN;0212-4521;2174-6486;;ENSEN CIENC;Ensen.

This paper gives an outline of its basic perspective on human rights and refers to its historical basis. The Latin American Catholic liberation-theological perspective is described as one important voice in the emergence of a new global ethic centred on human rights. It is profoundly connected with the defence of the rights of the poor to a better life and of indigenous peoples in the Americas who have been profoundly hurt by several centuries of colonisation.;;;ALDUNATE, J (corresponding author), CATHOLIC UNIV CHILE,CASA BELARMINO,ALMIRANTE BARROSO 24,CASILLON 10445,SANTIAGO,CHILE.;;;;;;;8;9;9;1;3;CARFAX PUBL CO;ABINGDON;PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE;0305-7240;;;J MORAL EDUC;J.

Following up a qualitative tradition, a purposive sample was used which considered 13 ECEC settings, from the 2 leading providers of public ECEC in Chile: JUNJI (the National Board of Nurseries for its acronym in Spanish) and Integra Foundation. Different techniques were used for data collection: semi-structured interviews with principals, ECEC teachers, teaching assistants, and parents. In addition, a shadowing technique was used to observe principals. Findings show that ECEC principals' leadership is based on limited space to develop a pedagogical leadership due to a high administrative workload, alongside strong ethics of care fostered by principals, which are shared by the educational community - ECEC teachers, teaching assistants and families. We aim to generate knowledge about ECEC leadership for the Latin American context, particularly for the Chilean case, where we do not have any evidence about this topic.;"[Opazo, Maria-Jose] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Opazo, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;mariajose.opazo@ciae.uchile.cl;;;ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003];Support from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.;;44;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-293X;1752-1807;;EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC;Eur.

University presidents have played an increasingly important and complex role in this process. Meanwhile, understanding what happens at the very top of universities and who governs them is long overdue. Thus far, no study has attempted to understand what drives university presidents' survival in Chile. Drawing on scholarship on university presidents' turnover and on presidential survival from political science, we approach universities as political entities in which actors compete for power and office. Using an original dataset, we quantitatively analyze 236 presidents from 60 different Chilean universities between 1990 and 2019 to determine why some presidents stay in office while other involuntarily steps down. Our results show that survival is chiefly explained by the university's level of institutionalization (accreditation and year of foundation), whether it is public (state-owned) or private, and the frequency of street protests against presidents.;"[Martinez, Christopher A.; Arellano, Juan Carlos] Univ Catolica Temuco, Manuel Montt 056, Temuco 4813302, Chile";;Martinez, CA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Manuel Montt 056, Temuco 4813302, Chile.;"christopher.martinez@uct.cl; jarellano@uct.cl";Martínez, Christopher A/C-7570-2014;Martínez, Christopher A/0000-0001-5612-6567;"FONDECYT Iniciacio'nComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160438]; Chile's Comision Nacional de Inivestgacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Proyecto VIP UCT [2020REG-CM-03]; Universidad Cato'lica de Temuco's Vicerrectori'a de Investigacio'n y Postgrado";Our research has been funded by (a) FONDECYT Iniciacio'n, Grant No. 11160438, from Chile's Comision Nacional de Inivestgacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), and (b) Proyecto VIP UCT, Grant No. 2020REG-CM-03, from Universidad Cato'lica de Temuco's Vicerrectori'a de Investigacio'n y Postgrado.;;52;0;0;1;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

International Journal of Science Education, 24(4), 357-368. doi:10.1080/09500690110066485). The study covered 290 students in three schools in different parts of Chile. Results showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.86 and medium correlation between the dimensions of the instrument. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the five dimensions' theoretical structure is supported by the data, and one-way ANOVA and a t-test showed a balanced, non-discriminatory instrument that is suited for use in the Spanish language. The instrument also showed that Chilean students most need improvement in two of the dimensions - 'understanding of scientific models in terms of exact replicas' and the 'use of scientific models'. This reflects the original data analysed by Treagust et al. (2002) and suggests that these factors are common issues in the teaching and learning of scientific models. Future research will review the data by year and group to determine how students develop the idea of a scientific model and relate this information to science curricula. It will also investigate the link between students' understanding of scientific models and Anderson & Krathwohl's (2001) cognitive taxonomy.;"[Villablanca, S.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Programa Pedag Ciencias & Matemat, Santiago, Chile; [Montenegro, M.] Factoria Ideas, Santiago, Chile; [Ramos-Moore, E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Fis, Santiago, Chile";;Villablanca, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Programa Pedag Ciencias & Matemat, Santiago, Chile.;savillablanca@uc.cl;;Villablanca, Steffan/0000-0001-8027-827X;;;;26;2;2;2;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

Inspired by feminist geographers, it considers the nation as an affective device and geopolitics as the power asymmetries resulting from the encounter of different corporealities. Three cases are used to produce narratives about the affective geopolitics influencing Colombian doctoral students in Chile by analysing how their trajectories create unbalanced powers and affect how they live and re-signify their bodies and nationality. The results indicate that, by presenting themselves as Colombians, students are associated with stigmatised Colombian bodies, which include the notions that they are sexually reified, black, poor, and vulgar. At the same time, they try to dissolve the stereotype of the Colombian person in Chile and use their privileged positions as high-skilled graduate students to detach from the great Colombian immigrant flow.;[Martinez, Cesar Augusto Ferrari] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Martinez, CAF (corresponding author), Fac Educ, 4860 Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.;cesarfmartinez@yahoo.com.br;Ferrari Martinez, Cesar Augusto/G-1031-2017;Ferrari Martinez, Cesar Augusto/0000-0003-1012-8975;Chilean Commission for Science and Technology [21160217];This research was funded by Chilean Commission for Science and Technology under the Grant #21160217.;;51;0;0;0;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7925;1469-3623;;COMPARE;Compare;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/03057925.2020.1847045;;NOV 2020;14;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;OV5YW;WOS:000592286100001;;;;;2022-04-06;

Due to school closures, teaching placements have had to shift from the face-to-face lessons to an entirely virtual model. Twenty-seven Chilean English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher candidates participated in this interpretative case study aiming at exploring the challenges and opportunities of this virtual teaching experience. The results indicate that factors such as the lack of direct interaction with learners and the sudden change of setting were among those that most strongly affected the participants' own learning process. Despite the challenges presented, student teachers suggested that this unique experience would contribute positively, at least to a certain extent, to their teacher education and their future careers.

These explanations serve to clarify concepts, procedures, facts, ideas, or types of problems, and are aimed at promoting student understanding. The low performance of Chilean science teachers on explanations has led us to incorporate instances in chemistry teachers education specifically aimed at developing the necessary skills to construct subject-adequate science teaching explanations. The objective of this research was to characterize the transference of the components of preservice teachers' subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. Through a qualitative methodology with an exploratory case study approach, we analyzed a total of 112 scientific explanations constructed by 28 chemistry preservice teachers throughout a 4-month training process. Our results show that, for the analyzed sample, the formulation of subject-adequate science teaching explanations involve different components whose development has distinctive characteristics. The criteria associated with the form of the explanations, which depend on teachers' discursive knowledge, can be developed in teachers' education through recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The criteria associated with the function of the explanations, which depend on teachers' content knowledge, require other strategies besides the disciplinary courses and recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations, to get teachers to formulate subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The work developed can provide instructional and evaluative strategies for science teachers' education, oriented to one of the teaching core practices that requires our attention as teacher trainers.;"[Marzabal, Ainoa; Moreira, Patricia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Merino, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Chem, Ave Brasil 2950, Valparaiso, Chile; [Delgado, Virginia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Chem & Pharm, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Marzabal, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 4860, Chile.;"amarzabal@uc.cl; cristian.merino@pucv.cl; pmmoreira@uc.cl; vcdelgad@uc.cl";"Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017";"Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Delgado-Chang, Virginia/0000-0001-6299-4686";Comision Nacional de Investigacion cientifica y tecnologica (CONICYT) of ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [1160148];This study is part of the project Fondecyt Regular 1160148, funded by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion cientifica y tecnologica (CONICYT) of Chile.;;40;0;0;2;20;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0157-244X;1573-1898;;RES SCI EDUC;Res.

To achieve this, the discussion that has taken place in these countries about the importance of sentence grammar in the teaching of writing is analysed. Three proposals for the contextualised teaching of grammar are systematised from the literature review: those that are focused in the writing process, those focused on metalinguistic reflection and those with a greater emphasis in the grammar of text. Besides, the school curricula of 14 Spanish-speaking countries that were involved in the international assessment of TERCE are examined. This analysis shows an evident attachment to the communicative approach of grammar. This means that in almost all countries grammar is taught linked to the linguistic skills of reading, writing or orality, with an especial emphasis in writing. Also, two tendencies can be observed in the curricula of this countries, that guide the way in which curricula use sentence grammar to have an impact on written communication: (i) from sentence grammar to text grammar and (ii) from text grammar to sentence grammar.;"[Sotomayor, Carmen; Chaf, Gabriela; Osorio, Gabriela; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Julia Coloma, Carmen] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Dept Fonoaudiol, Santiago, Chile";;Sotomayor, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.;csotomayor@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT]Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160471]";"This work was supported by PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [Project FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT No1160471].";;61;1;2;1;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0267-1522;1470-1146;;RES PAP EDUC;Res.

Environmental factors such as socioeconomic level (SEL) influence reading and maths skills as well as EFs. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which executive functions play a mediating role between SEL and reading and maths performance. To this end, we assessed 286 Chilean primary education students: 86 with a high SEL and 200 with a low level. The results show that the high-SEL group obtained consistently higher scores than their peers with low SEL levels in both reading and maths tasks as well as in EF measurements. This suggests that SEL could influence the development of these variables. The results also showed that EFs partially mediate the relation between SEL and reading and maths skills in primary school students through the specific function of inhibition.

Applicants came from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, and were admitted through a formal process that looked for personal skills beyond standardized test results.

A quasi-experimental and multilevel design was employed. University teachers answered the Approaches to Teaching Inventory and students completed the Course Experience Questionnaire and the Study Process Questionnaire. In addition, contextual variables were included for both teachers and students. The total sample included 44 teachers and 686 students. Of these, 25 university teachers had completed the University Teaching Diploma and 19 had not; 373 students were in courses with a diploma teacher and 313 in courses were not. Results show that those university teachers who have completed the programme have, in their courses, students who were more likely to declare having adopted a deep approach to studying than those teachers who have not participated in the diploma. At the same time, no significant impact was found on the student learning experience. For practical purposes, this investigation provides evidence for the value of teaching development programmes in promoting deeper approaches to studying. For research purposes, it proposes the use of multilevel models to evaluate the impact of university teaching diplomas.";"[Marchant, Jorge] Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Pregrad, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Faure, Jaime] Univ Andres Bello, Vicerrectoria Acad, Santiago, Chile";;Marchant, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Pregrad, Santiago, Chile.;jorge.marchant@udp.cl;González, Carlos/D-7228-2017;"González, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777; marchant, jorge/0000-0003-4207-3817";;;;36;3;3;1;9;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0260-2938;1469-297X;;ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU;Assess.

In the text, we analyze the reasons, presented and studied from a comparative perspective between both contexts, which lead to this assertion. Among them, the existing colonial legacy, the social, political and economic circumstances in the present Latin-American region, the rigid teaching structures and the political economy of its national higher education systems. These elements, interpreted as limits in the actual Latin American horizon, do not foreclose the possibility of hearing the echoes of the Bologna process towards a common Iberoamerican knowledge area. We present and analyze the initiatives towards this end (intergovernmental Declarations, Meetings of University Presidents and collaborative projects among universities in Latin American and the European Union, etc.), initiatives that express a commitment to advance towards the construction of common space for higher education. We conclude that although Bologna represents an unattainable horizon for Latin America, it nevertheless creates a space for critical reflection which allows Latin American higher education to ascertain its own limitations and possibilities.;Univ Diego Portales, Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile;;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Ejercito 333, Santiago, Chile.;josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com;BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021;;;;;47;10;19;1;11;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

SNA enables a deep exploration of learning and development as a by-product of social interactions. Research findings from social networks for creativity has found specific social structures that ease knowledge transfer and the emergence of creative ideas in a variety of contexts. This work links the research findings in social networks and creativity with education and classroom activities, to provide a framework from which to understand social interactions in the classroom and to inform educational improvement. By conceptualizing learning and problem solving as the creative outcome of both cognitive and social processes, this paper describes how different forms of collaboration and social structures might emerge based on teaching and learning practices enacted in the classroom through the lens of social network analysis. In addition, attention to the classroom network should inform teachers on areas for pedagogical innovation. Subsequently, I propose guidelines on how to advance pedagogical decision-making for learning and creativity based upon students' social networks.

Each of them portrays a particular aspect of the experience of having a calling to teach. The narratives of these five teachers, augmented by the 76 teachers interviewed who group themselves within these focal narratives, illuminate the power of calling and suggest a rethinking of spirituality's role in teachers' work and identity.

This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades.

The results obtained show that analyzed studies explicitly present energy as a property of matter. These same texts have a syntactic assertiveness, presenting energy in 57 % of sentences as part of the predicate, with a material reference. On the other hand, the most frequent ontological error found is the presentation of energy as an object. Finally, it is concluded that there are ontologically ambiguous verbs that can generate confusions in the meaning of energy and that a large part of ontological and syntax errors is due the absence of a material reference within a sentence.;"[Fernanda Guajardo, Maria; Quiroz, Waldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile";;Guajardo, MF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile.;"mguajardocastro17@gmail.com; waldo.quiroz@pucv.cl";;;;;;35;0;0;1;1;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;BARCELONA;SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN;0212-4521;2174-6486;;ENSEN CIENC;Ensen.

Professional development programs are proposed as effective mechanisms to fabricate the new teacher. However, this teacher has proved hard to produce. Thus, the resistor teacher has emerged into the field as a way to explain failure within school mathematics reform. In this article, I assume that resistance is a consequential response against particular forms of subjectivation imposed on mathematics teachers. Using conceptual tools from Hall and Foucault, I explore the ways wherein a high school mathematics teacher reinvents meanings of being a mathematics teacher in the context of a professional development program aimed to implement problem-solving instruction. Against the myth of the resistor teacher unwilling to change, what emerges is a process of struggle over meaning. School mathematics reform, considered as an ideological event, becomes a site in which competing meanings about being a mathematics teacher are negotiated, contested, and resisted.;[Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile;;Valoyes-Chavez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;luz.valoyes@ciae.uchile.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3180238]";Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and CONICYT/FONDECYT #3180238 is gratefully recognized.;;47;4;5;1;15;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

Significant differences between urban and rural schools were found in terms of accessibility issues. Moreover, rural school integration programs have a lower probability of providing adapted resources or sign language interpreters.

Based on available material and secondary sources, it describes the main features of this student movement, analyses the key components of the students' discourse and its relationship with the Chilean market-oriented educational system, and identifies its impact on the field of higher education. The paper argues that this student movement was a process of expressing accumulated grievances against some neoliberal features of Chilean education. Since this movement is also linked to the emergence of a new generation of higher education students, it identifies relevant characteristics of current students' organisations and protests. Finally, the paper discusses hypotheses for interpreting the recent student movements. This case is informative not only for those concerned with student participation, but also with the potential downsides of market-oriented educational policies.;"[Bellei, Cristian; Orellana, Victor] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Cabalin, Cristian] Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl;"Bellei, Cristián/D-9921-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014";"Bellei, Cristián/0000-0001-6963-7809; Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478; Orellana, Victor/0000-0001-9599-966X";;;;46;63;77;1;47;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

Recent history makes a historical analysis of social reality and a historiographical analysis of the immediate. It is located between history and present, between past and present, between witness and historian, between memory and history. This situation creates problems in teaching. This article investigates the teaching-learning process of the subunit 'Military regime and transition to democracy' in secondary schools in Santiago, Chile, by means of both a quantitative methodological strategy to identify six unique cases, and a qualitative strategy that is reported in this article. A variety of practices highlighted four models: constructivism, development of meta-cognition, historical discourse, and moral discourse. These models are described. Their diversity is due to the existence of different theoretical frameworks. This unit has gaps in content and historiographical knowledge, and there is no coordination with human rights education. The diversity of models is cause for concern because not all of them encourage students to understand the present as a result of a historical process and how to operate within it.;"[Isabel Toledo, Maria; Gazmuri, Renato] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Magendzo, Abraham] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile";;Toledo, MI (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Santiago Ctr, Vergara 275, Santiago, Chile.;"maria.toledo@udp.cl; abrahammagendzo@gmail.com; renatojuanjose.gazmuri@campus.uab.cat";;;;;;26;0;2;0;12;UNIV PRETORIA, FAC EDUCATION;PRETORIA;UNIV PRETORIA, FAC EDUCATION, PRETORIA, 00001, SOUTH AFRICA;0258-2236;;;PERSPECT EDUC;Perspect.

Furthermore, it explores the neutrality of the content taught; the ideological standpoints of the teachers and the students; emotions that emerge; relationships with the victims and so on. These tensions were noted during research undertaken in secondary schools in Santiago, Chile, in 2007. Introducing recent history into curriculum content is a way to teach citizenship education since it enables students to understand how historical processes occur and influence the present and permits understanding of the social context and everyday reality. However, when what is taught from recent history is an account of the violation of human rights, teaching becomes much more difficult and complex and several moral problems arise because of the proximity of the events, diverse interpretations of the facts and the different levels and ways of involvement of the teachers and students.";"[Magendzo, Abraham] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Doctorate Program Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Isabel Toledo, Maria] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Psychol, Fac Human Sci & Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Magendzo, A (corresponding author), Camino Bodega 7173,CP 7660200 Vitacura, Santiago, Chile.;abrahammagendzo@gmail.com;;;;;;19;13;19;0;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0305-7240;;;J MORAL EDUC;J.

Therefore, it is timely to examine teacher educators from different fields of expertise to offer a more specific and subject-related understanding of their professional learning involvement. This study investigates the initiatives that Chilean university-based ESOL teacher educators engage in to continue learning and their perceived professional learning needs. Data are drawn from a national web-based survey and a focus group. The results suggest that individual formal learning opportunities that are highly valued, and sometimes prescribed, by higher education institutions are predominant. Their professional learning needs, however, relate mainly to promoting collaborative peer-learning, advancing knowledge about diversity in the classroom and technology literacy, and enhancing their research skills and practice in language teaching. This study highlights the importance of identifying these needs as a foundation to design learning opportunities that meet the demands of the profession and the particularities of each discipline.

However, despite four decades of research suggesting that dialogical interactions promote student learning, it has been very difficult to reflect this in practice. Teachers' professional development programmes oriented towards promoting dialogical pedagogies have been based on sociocultural approaches centred on teachers' reflective analysis of classroom practices. Studies show that reflecting on pedagogical practices is necessary but insufficient to promote the desired changes. Beyond reflection, initiatives centred on scaffolding the practice with dialogic discursive repertoires have seen more successful results. This suggests that centring on the practice seems to be fundamental to change. Nevertheless, the theoretical basis has not been elaborated further to understand why centring on the direct scaffolding of practice would promote teachers' learning and pedagogical practice transformation. In order to account for the available empirical evidence, drawing on the works of Bakhtin and Vygotsky, the aim of this paper is to elaborate on a dialogical theory of teacher learning. Using this theoretical approach, different theoretical views of learning, teacher professional development programmes and the main tensions therein are discussed.;"[Guzman, Valentina; Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman, V (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;vaguzman@uahurtado.cl;;Guzman Fernandez, Valentina Sonia/0000-0001-6164-0843;Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170431];This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [GRANT NUMBER:1170431].;;54;0;0;1;10;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1941-5257;1941-5265;;PROF DEV EDUC;Prof. Dev.

It analyzes how these particular usages were crossed by affective intensities that worked to produce students' political subjectivities as collective and agentic. This affective work was produced with other members of the school community and sometimes was met with anger, policing practices, and desires to exclude students from particular historical narratives. The data for this article were produced within a yearlong critical ethnographic study on the processes of production of high school feminist students' gender and political subjectivities in Chile, which included participant observation, testimonios interviews, art-based collective testimonios workshops, and analysis through affect theory. The findings show the types of historical and political narratives and symbols used by students, what affective intensities that crossed these symbols did to the students' political subjectivities, and the conflicts these intensities produced within the school community.

Using a systematic review as the methodological approach, the eight core educational management and administration leadership journals were selected to collect the sources. Among this corpus of data, four main topics emerged: (a) factors affecting principal succession; (b) the dilemma between change and continuity; (c) the impact of principal succession on teachers; and (d) the evaluation of succession programs. We found that the volume of evidence on principal succession in K-12 schools is low and narrow, even with the importance of the topic.

Given their consequences, and the high stakes derived from them, assessment systems put pressure on schools to an extent where their practices and internal policies adapt to the logic of these mechanisms. The behaviours that emerge from this adaptation are seen as gaming the system' and are often portrayed as the responsibility of test users. However, the article aims at pushing the question around the consequences of metrics further, in terms of what these strategic gaming behaviours are adapting to and to what extent predominant metrics are accomplishing their assumptions of social justice. Through theoretically discussing the concept of social justice in connection with educational assessment, the paper problematises whether current metrics and their consequences, on the one hand, are able to respond to their underlying principles of equality of opportunity, which are characteristic of justice as distribution, and, on the other hand, highlights the insufficiency of these principles to respond to current developments of the concept of social justice with regard to the dimensions of recognition and participation, with considerations for their potential inclusion in future assessment systems.;"[Florez Petour, Maria Teresa; Rozas Assael, Tamara; Gysling, Jacqueline; Olave Astorga, Jose Miguel] Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile";;Petour, MTF (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile.;mtflorez@u.uchile.cl;;;;;;60;2;2;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-4985;1465-3915;;OXFORD REV EDUC;Oxf.

This study presents the experience of action-research included in a teacher professional development program focused on improving pedagogical interaction from a sociocultural perspective. From 2012 to 2015, three cohorts of early childhood teachers from nursery schools located in vulnerable contexts participated in this program. These teachers developed intervention plans according to the action-research framework. In this report, these plans are analysed through a qualitative content analysis. Reports made by the participants and interviews with three tutors are also analysed. The results of the intervention plans show that most of them are focused on teacher professional development using video supported reflection to enhance the quality of interaction with children. In the reports, teachers identified important improvements in their skills, knowledge, beliefs and practices, and developed critical reflection on the process. Tutors found some problems during the program, which took them into a reflection process that led to transformations in their practice. These results are discussed in the context of a neoliberal society that might interfere with the development of alternative programs.;"[Guerra, Paula; Figueroa, Ignacio] Univ Diego Portales, Cognit Dev Ctr, Santiago, Chile";;Guerra, P (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Cognit Dev Ctr, Santiago, Chile.;paula.guerra@mail.udp.cl;Figueroa-Céspedes, Ignacio/B-5316-2019;"Figueroa-Céspedes, Ignacio/0000-0002-2756-1831; guerra, paula/0000-0001-8180-3101";;;;43;0;0;1;5;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0957-5146;1472-4421;;EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON;Early Years;;2018;38;4;;;;;396;410;;10.1080/09575146.2017.1288088;;;15;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;HF3SR;WOS:000454155300007;;;;;2022-04-06;

In engineering, there have been numerous initiatives to implement REL over recent years, given the fundamental role of laboratory activities. However, in the past efforts have concentrated on laboratory groups interacting face to face, disregarding the capacities of distributed student collaborative environments. This article proposes a model for the implementation of REL in a distributed collaborative scenario, focusing on two crucial key elements: shared knowledge and interaction for collaboration. The model focuses on the methodological aspects of executing REL in a distributed collaborative scenario and disregards technical aspects of the implementation. This study analyses distributed collaborative scenarios where the teacher plays a fundamental role in REL configuration to ensure group collaboration. The new model introduced presents diverse aspects that are associated with the methodological implementation of REL in the field of engineering; hence it is to be regarded as a foundation for teachers developing REL in distributed collaborative scenarios.";"[Herrera, Oriel A.] Univ Catolica Temuco, Informat Engn Sch, Temuco, Chile; [Fuller, David A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago 4860, Chile";;Herrera, OA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Informat Engn Sch, Temuco, Chile.;"oherrera@inf.uct.cl; dfuller@ing.puc.cl";;;;;;32;11;11;0;3;AUSTRALASIAN SOC COMPUTERS LEARNING TERTIARY EDUCATION-ASCILITE;TUGUN;UNIT 5, 202 COODE ST, PO BOX 350, TUGUN, 4224, AUSTRALIA;1449-3098;1449-5554;;AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC;Australas.

Thus, the fractal Sierpinski triangle is chosen with the aim of proposing a cognitive model for its learning. Based on the APOS theory (action, process, object and scheme), mental structures and mechanisms that can be constructed by high school students who develop a sequence of written activities are described. The empirical results report that the fractal under study is built as a totality from a mental mechanism that has been called synthesis, a mechanism that could open new development opportunities for the APOS theory.;"[Gutierrez Figueroa, Ximena] Univ Chile, Ctr Estudios & Desarrollo Educ Continua Magisteri, Santiago, Chile; [Parraguez Gonzalez, Marcela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Valparaiso, Chile";;Figueroa, XG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Estudios & Desarrollo Educ Continua Magisteri, Santiago, Chile.;"ximenagutierrez@u.uchile.cl; marcela.parraguez@pucv.cl";;;;;;34;0;0;2;2;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA;VICERECTORAT RELACIONS INSTITUCIONALS & CULTURA, UNIV VALENCIA, VICERECTORAT INVESTIGACIO, CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN;0212-4521;2174-6486;;ENSEN CIENC;Ensen.

Therefore, in order to develop and implement successful methodologies in the classroom aiming to improve students' scientific literacy, it seems crucial to know what exactly science is. However, defining science turns out to be a complex problem inside the philosophy of science, and it has even been claimed that science cannot be defined. There are several strategies to face this problem in science education. Here, we show that most of the current strategies are lists of features trying to capture the nature of science, and we also show that the kind of strategies based on lists of features have insurmountable problems. We recognise the strengths and weaknesses of two main approaches, and building from those lessons we create a tool guiding the exploration of science nature which is free of the problems identified in previous approaches.;"[Romero-Maltrana, Diego; Duarte, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile";;Romero-Maltrana, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.;diego.romero@pucv.cl;;;;;;43;2;2;6;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0157-244X;1573-1898;;RES SCI EDUC;Res.

Uncertainty, however, still exists in terms of the quality assurance consistency in the current Chilean accreditation system, especially in terms of the relation between public policy quality indicators for higher education and their relation to accreditation outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to make a first explorative attempt to investigate the relationships between these indicators and the results of undergraduate programme accreditation. We hypothesised that the public policy quality indicators of first-year drop-out rate, employment at graduation and ratio of actual to expected time to graduation would be strongly correlated to undergraduate programme accreditation as well as largely explaining its accreditation-year variance. By means of correlation and multiple regression analyses, we found small-sized associations, being first-year drop-out the only significant predictor of programme accreditation, explaining a 9.4% of its variance. These results raise questions regarding the consistency between the aims of public policy for higher education and the current accreditation system. This study should be of value to policy makers, managers and curriculum developers in terms of this initial analysis of the consistency between quality indicators and the accreditation system. Further research is necessary to make a systematic and in-depth assessment of the impact of quality assurance mechanisms to provide better rationale for making important decisions such as when defining the characteristics of the accrediting institutions as well as for establishing effective ways to achieve the proposed public policy objectives.;"[Jerez, Oscar; Orsini, Cesar; Hasbun, Beatriz; Lobos, Eduardo; Munoz, Marcos] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, Cesar] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile";;Jerez, O (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile.;ojerez@fen.uchile.cl;"Lobos, Eduardo/AAI-8022-2020; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Jerez, Oscar/J-2947-2016";"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Jerez, Oscar/0000-0003-0869-5938";;;;52;6;6;4;60;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

Second, we discuss developmental and neuropsychological theories of self-regulation, demonstrating conceptual links with biological and systems theory. Third, we discuss the implications for education, using the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as an example on how the construction of the biological, as the natural foundation of individuality, is intensified by the ideal integration of individuals as self-regulated agents.

An activity in this context is defined as a sequence of actions that an actor may perform to accomplish a task objective. The proposed methodology validates a design experimentally by comparing the actions it specifies with those that are observed in an actual activity. Analyzing the data collected through such observation is central to determining which actions would improve the social dynamics of the original design. The criteria for adopting a discovered pattern will depend on the activity's aims and the kind of actions observed. The proposed methodology is illustrated using data gathered during physics classes in two schools. The findings suggest that when formulating technologically mediated activities inside a classroom, designers should seek to incorporate face-to-face actions that support the dynamics of the activity and assist in achieving the social objectives of the tasks performed. The inclusion of such actions in design upgrades can also help prevent the occurrence of actions that interfere with the activity.;"[Francisca Capponi, Maria] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Marshall, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Math, Santiago, Chile; [Ester Lagos, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Comenius, Santiago, Chile";;Capponi, MF (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile.;"mcapponi@inacap.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; gm@mat.puc.cl; maria.lagos@centrocomenius.org";Marshall, Guillermo/F-2302-2011;;;;;40;6;8;0;13;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN;DOULIU CITY;NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

The reasons are to be found in the continent's historic and modern institutional patterns. Latin American governments increasingly limit their interventions to funding and rely on the free play of the forces of supply and demand, institutional and corporate interests, and negotiated rules of the game to coordinate their systems. Moreover, Latin America's dynamic tertiary education systems face structural, organizational, and functional obstacles that often discourage international convergence. However, Bologna is stimulating closer university collaboration between Latin American and European institutions, particularly Spanish and Portuguese universities, in an effort to create an Ibero-American area of knowledge, with student and faculty exchanges. Thus Bologna has had an indirect stimulus by encouraging collaboration, and concomitant issues such as Latin America's current debate about curricular reform and higher education competitiveness.;Univ Diego Portales, Francisco Chacon Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile;;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Francisco Chacon Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile.;josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com;BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021;Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237;;;;45;18;19;1;17;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1028-3153;1552-7808;;J STUD INT EDUC;J.

J;Bernasconi, A;;;;Bernasconi, Andres;;;Does the affiliation of universities to external organizations foster diversity in private higher education? Chile in comparative perspective;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"affiliation; Chile; differentiation; diversification; interorganizational relationships; isomorphism; new institutionalism; organizational linkages; private higher education; proprietary higher education; relationship magnitude";"INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; PATTERNS";The expansion of private sectors of higher education has usually been regarded as a factor of diversification in higher education systems. Some of this differentiation has been found to arise from the affiliation of private institutions with organizations outside the field of higher education. This article reports the results of a study of this form of interorganizational relationship in private universities in Chile. Cases include universities founded or sponsored by religious, business and military organizations. A typology of private universities is proposed, on the basis of the forms affiliation (or its absence), was observed to take in the cases examined. Weak and strong forms of affiliation are described, and affiliated universities are compared to proprietary universities, i.e., those owned by individuals who govern them from their positions in the board of directors, and independent universities, in which governance lies with internal-academic or administrative-constituents. Albeit derived from the case of Chile, the typology could be applied to the analysis of private higher education in other national systems. The second part of the article seeks to ascertain whether affiliation operates as a source of differentiation in Chilean private higher education. Results show that, compared to the other types of private universities, the affiliated ones possess distinctive mission statements and declarations of principles, consistent with the orientations of their sponsor institutions, they tend to be smaller, and to have more full-time and better qualified faculty. Some receive financial support from their sponsor organization or its members. Distinctiveness was not found in indicators of prestige and student selectivity, nor in tuition levels, program offerings, curriculum design, the weight of research and graduate programs in their functions, student socioeconomic profile, and faculty involvement in governance. This is not to say that there are no differences in these dimensions among private universities: much diversity exists, but most of it cuts across all categories of interest for our study. Overall, affiliation does not appear to be a strong factor behind the diversification that exists in the Chilean private university sector.;Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.;abernasconi@utalca.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;56;18;23;0;31;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Two segregation indices, the dissimilarity index and the square root index, are used to meet these objectives. The results show high and persistent segregation for high socioeconomic status students, in contrast to the moderate and decreasing segregation levels seen in the low and middle socioeconomic groups. Besides, the decomposition exercise posits the universities as the focus of segregation in this system, where both the institution and the degree program constitute relevant factors in understanding the unequal distribution of high socioeconomic status students. These results invite an in-depth look at the mechanisms that hinder social integration in this area, with a particular emphasis on the segregation of the highest socioeconomic status students, whose place in this system promotes their academic and social differentiation.;"[Kuzmanic, Danilo; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Luisa Quaresma, Maria] Univ Autonoma Chile, Inst Iberoamericano Desarrollo Sostenible, Santiago, Chile";;Kuzmanic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.;danilo.kuzmanic@ciae.uchile.cl;;"Quaresma, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-5292-2603; Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213";"ANID, FONDECYT [1170371]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]";This work was supported by ANID, FONDECYT under Grant Regular Project #1170371.

For this purpose, a mixed-methods research was carried out, applying a questionnaire to more than 7000 Chilean students aged 12 to 18 years, and interviews with 14 specialists in the field of education. The study yielded three main results: firstly, it showed that parental mediation at home has a much greater impact -on the use of technologies and academic performance- than mediation carried out in schools. Secondly, it was observed that students who use YouTube as a study tool have a lower school performance than students who use their notebook notes. Thirdly, we identified difficulties and challenges in the implementation of ICT in the classroom.

In this article, we conceptualize reading mediation as a 'technology of affect'. We propose 'mediation-as-usual', a normative becoming of this technology, tasked with producing categories and identities regarding readers. Within this technology, adults are produced as empathetic, caring, and providers of safe spaces for reading. We report on literary encounters at a school in Santiago, Chile, with a 'challenging' picturebook. We were involved in the emergence of what we term 'abject mediation', a figuration that produces the limits and boundaries of mediation-as-usual, and, we argue, has transformative potential. However, this is an ephemeral figuration, as reterritorialization works to assimilate the border elements, actualizing mediation-as-usual.

Our results show that the presence of women in the research space is stable across time, but they tend to collaborate more than men, acting as important bridgers since 2000, and that their contribution is relevant in promoting networking.

The majority of paper-based options can be classified as being either multiple-choice or constructed-response. Therefore, in the process of creating an educational drill-and-practice video game, one fundamental question to be answered is which is the most appropriate response format? This paper answers this question, proposing a hybrid format that we call fine-grained multiple-choice, where the player constructs their response one element at a time, with each element chosen from a pre-defined set. A comparative study was conducted with second grade students. When comparing the impact of an educational drill-and-practice video game that uses multiple-choice with one that uses fine-grained multiple-choice, we observe that the fine-grained multiple-choice game achieved better results. However, the multiple-choice game was substantially more successful at capturing the students' interest and motivation. Considering the widespread use of the multiple-choice format in game-based learning activities, as well as in interactive activities, this research suggests rethinking what the most suitable answer format might be for each area of the curriculum and for the different types of games.;"[Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile; [Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Grass, Antonio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";;"Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile.; Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile.";vagner.beserra@gmail.com;"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020";"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748";"CONICYT - FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca";"This work was supported by CONICYT - FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca.";;88;3;3;1;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

J;Glas, K;;;;Glas, Katharina;;;Opening up spaces for manoeuvre': English teacher perspectives on learner motivation;RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"learner motivation; teacher agency; English language teaching; motivational strategies; Chile";"LANGUAGE; STRATEGIES; AUTONOMY";This qualitative study explores teachers' perspectives on learner motivation for English in Chilean secondary schools. Drawing both on motivation theories and on concepts related to teacher cognition, autonomy and agency, the analysis of 19 semi-structured interviews with Chilean English teachers sheds light on the difficulties that many teachers have in motivating their students so that they engage in classroom activities and learning. Findings show that teachers with a developed sense of agency report higher levels of learner motivation. Salient features of their accounts are classroom practices that grant students immediate positive experiences while learning English, rather than referring to future benefits. Other features are autonomous learning tasks, and a context-appropriate, empowering selection of cultural contents. The discussion suggests that teachers need to develop a sound sense of agency to identify spaces to manoeuvre' between external constraints, such as curricular policies or lack of parental support, and possible internal constraints, such as paralysing beliefs about their own competence or a limited cultural repertoire to draw on in order to make English lessons motivating and meaningful for their students. For improved learner motivation and meaningful learning, research needs to support teachers' autonomy in times of increasing curricular regulation and standardisation of knowledge.;[Glas, Katharina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Ave El Bosque 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile;;Glas, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Ave El Bosque 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;katharina.glas@ucv.cl;;Glas, Katharina/0000-0002-8214-1725;;;;37;4;5;1;12;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0267-1522;1470-1146;;RES PAP EDUC;Res.

The proposed model, called ICTE-MM (ICT in School Education Maturity Model), has three elements supporting educational processes: information criteria, ICT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on ICT, five Leverage Domains are defined: Educational Management, Infrastructure, Administrators, Teachers and Students. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model's elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two elements establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international standards and best practices for ICT management. It has been validated through data collection instruments and its associated web-support tool was also refined with a small pilot study. In summary, the proposed ICTE-MM model provides a basis for self-assessment and improvement planning. It is not just a diagnostic tool but has also been found to be useful for guiding the principals in ICT investment.;"[Solar, Mauricio] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Sabattin, Jorge; Parada, Victor] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Solar, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.;"mauricio.solar@usm.cl; jorge.sabattin@usach.cl; victor.parada@usach.cl";"Solar, Mauricio G./A-1109-2008; Solar, Mauricio/AAE-9673-2020; Sabattin, Jorge/P-2589-2019";"Solar, Mauricio/0000-0002-4433-4622; Sabattin, Jorge/0000-0003-0270-6560";;;;32;36;37;4;40;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Leading exponents do not agree on its definition and include the two main traditions: Anglo-American and German, and various groups or research centres throughout the Western world. Something problematic happens with the models of progression or development of historical thinking that lack an agreed upon psychological theory as their foundation. We argue that theoretical differences are produced by the split between the psychological, considered individually, and the social, considered external to individual thought. In this article we propose that researchers of the development of historical thinking can benefit from a re-reading of Vygotskian theory, with a focus on everyday concepts, scientific concepts and zones of proximal development. In this paper, we carry out a conceptual systemization of historical thinking based on this literature. We distinguish several dimensions that we group into three 'macro-dimensions' according to their psychological dynamics of development, which is dialectically related with history education and the socio-historical conditions surrounding it. These macro-dimensions explain the developmental rhythms of historical thinking and include the disciplinary knowledge macro-dimension, the epistemological macro-dimension, and the ethical-political macro-dimension.;"[Albornoz Munoz, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Sebastian Balmaceda, Christian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile";;Munoz, NA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.;noalbornoz@uc.cl;;"SEBASTIAN BALMACEDA, Christian Luis/0000-0001-5038-9227; Albornoz, Natalia/0000-0003-3915-2442";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21170619];This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Beca Doctorado Nacional 21170619].;;70;0;0;2;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0022-0272;1366-5839;;J CURRICULUM STUD;J.

This article examines the various ways in which these studies have impacted on educational policies in Chile. It discusses how results were used for leverage purposes in law-making, and how the concepts and frameworks of specific ILSAs were integrated into crucial normative policy instruments, particularly curriculum standards, as well as the national assessment framework and instruments.

While second language acquisition tasks have been taken online, the traditional language laboratory has remained unchanged. By continuing to follow its original configuration based on individual work, the language laboratory fails to take advantage of the potential provided by collaborative learning. We propose the use of a language laboratory based on single-display groupware (SDG) for learning vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and listening comprehension. By adopting SDG, the language laboratory benefits from the advantages of small group collaborative learning. In this paper, we first describe the design and pedagogical merit of the SDG collaborative language laboratory. We then share the results of a quasi-experimental pre-post comparison study, and use an observation guideline to analyze whether the conditions for collaborative learning have been fulfilled. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that developing pronunciation skills can be more effective when using a collaborative language laboratory versus an individual language laboratory.

The analysis is based on the data from a national study aimed at measuring students' Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills for learning. A factor analysis was carried out to categorize students' activities with computers and several indexes were constructed to define the comparison groups. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explain the frequency of the activities. Results show that students with access to computers at home mainly perform activities categorized as Socializing, Academic, Gaming and Production and that although the absolute frequency of these activities differs across groups, the profiles of computer use are surprisingly similar for groups based on students' socio-economic group, experience with ICT, and self-confidence in the use of ICT. The only variable that discriminates user profiles is gender. Based on these findings, it can be claimed that Chilean secondary students with access to computers at home tend to show a rather homogenous computer-use profile, once access is equated.;"[Enrique Hinostroza, J.; Matamala, Carolina; Labbe, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena; Cabello, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile";;Hinostroza, JE (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile.;enrique.hinostroza@iie.cl;"Hinostroza, J.

A cultural historical activity theory perspective is employed to explore and analyse the motives, activities, and actions that underpinned the work of these supervisors. Findings suggest that supervisors have to respond to often contradictory demands and an overemphasis towards quality assurance actions that are potentially detrimental to preservice teachers ' development.

In the context of attempts to address criticism that the sector is not free, public or high-quality enough, this article examines the association between education and its moral and ethical dimensions, and their separate yet complementary consideration alongside economic development, through the two centuries of the Chilean state's existence. Since the beginning of the current decade, discontent with the framing and performance of higher education as a whole has grown. The overview traces this process not as fresh crisis, but part of a social question pondered repeatedly in the past and supported with varying success through educational and political initiatives. This historical (and historiographic) approach illuminates the limits of conceiving of higher education as either an economic good or as a human right, and an overlooked need to support its benefits through policy. Not simply an interpenetration with economic thinking, but also a lack of sufficient appreciation of Chile's fundamental and singular character, present as challenges in understanding expanded access's function and its prospective contribution to growing debates around ethics and inequality.;"[Leihy, Peodair; Salazar, Jose M.] Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile";;Leihy, P (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile.;pete.leihy@uv.cl;;"Salazar, Jose/0000-0003-4636-1779; Leihy, Peodair/0000-0002-5569-0905";;;;57;6;7;3;38;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

The lack of literature review carried out on this topic reveals a lack of research relating to the coherence between the curriculum and the theoretical frameworks that support the teaching of this competence. This study reviews the study programmes that guide the teaching of oral communication in level two of elementary schools in Chile. To do so, each of the learning outcomes of these programmes was analysed and compared with theoretical categories from the communicative competence model. The results show that, while the design considers the different competences, there is still a lack of attention to the criteria of progression criteria and increasing complexity.

This article reviews the concept of attitudes toward science and their measurement. It subsequently analyzes the psychometric properties of the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA), such as its construct validity, its discriminant and concurrent validity, and its reliability. The evidence presented suggests that TOSRA, in its Spanish-adapted version, has adequate construct validity regarding its theoretical referents, as well as good indexes of reliability. In addition, it determines the attitudes toward science of secondary school students in Santiago de Chile (n = 664) and analyzes the sex variable as a differentiating factor in such attitudes. The analysis by sex revealed low-relevance gender difference. The results are contrasted with those obtained in English-speaking countries. This TOSRA sample showed good psychometric parameters for measuring and evaluating attitudes toward science, which can be used in classrooms of Spanish-speaking countries or with immigrant populations with limited English proficiency.;"[Navarro, Marianela; Gonzalez-Pose, Paulina] Univ Los Andes, Fac Educ, Ctr Res Educ, Monsenor Alvaro del Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile; [Forster, Carla; Gonzalez, Caterina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Navarro, M (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Educ, Ctr Res Educ, Monsenor Alvaro del Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile.;mnavarroc@uandes.cl;Förster, Carla/B-2104-2017;Förster, Carla/0000-0003-0576-6542;;;;53;14;15;6;44;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

Through a comprehensive meta-data analysis and bibliographic review, we collected information on both educational systems and their ICT adoption policies. Key differences necessary to understand how both countries have developed their educational systems by integrating ICT were analyzed, including the educational system structure, the organization of state entities responsible for educational ICT, cultural characteristics, the creation of policies regarding ICT in education, and the effectiveness of such policies for the expansion of infrastructure and the ICT curriculum integration. We analyze these key differences in order to understand two cases of ICT integration initiatives on a national level, so that we might better understand the primary factors that influence successful ICT integration, as well as those that may hinder progress in this area.

Data was obtained from interviews and surveys applied to teachers and students from 145 rural schools. Results show that teachers function as gatekeepers. They do not teach students how to use ICT explicitly, but when teachers have high expectations, skills and technology access, this leads to conditions for students learning how to use ICT. Finally, the data contributes to a better understanding of the new role that teachers and schools play in rural areas in terms of social and symbolic integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is crucial to recognize how early students can be subject to learning experiences that promote a language of uncertainty, assess the evidence provided by the data, and make generalizations. Findings The results reveal that while the educator demonstrated knowledge and skills relevant to the curriculum and conceptual teaching strategies, the understanding of the content by the students and the integration of the PCK components still present a challenge. Practical implications The lesson study collaborative teaching practices that promote PCK have proven effective for informing the design and implementation of instructional practices supporting the development of early statistical thinking in young children. Originality/value The study enriches the knowledge regarding the potential of the lesson study (LS) in the professional learning of kindergarten educators. It also contributes to a comprehensive approach based on authentic playful experiences in grade K that supports the development of early statistical thinking in young children.;"[Estrella, Soledad; Olfos, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Math, Valparaiso, Chile; [Mendez-Reina, Maritza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Aguilera, Jocelyn] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Math, Valparaiso, Chile";;Olfos, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Math, Valparaiso, Chile.;raimundo.olfos@pucv.cl;Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022;estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914;"ANID Fondecyt [1200346]; FONDEF [20i10070]; VRIEA PUCV [039.439/2020]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; National Doctorate Scholarship ANID [21210862]";"Support from ANID Fondecyt 1200346; FONDEF ID 20i10070; VRIEA PUCV 039.439/2020; National Doctorate Scholarship ANID 21210862; and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 are gratefully acknowledged.";;42;0;0;3;3;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2046-8253;2016-8261;;INT J LESSON LEARN S;Int.

J;Valencia, E;;;;Valencia, Edgar;;;Gender-biased evaluation or actual differences? Fairness in the evaluation of faculty teaching;HIGHER EDUCATION;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Bias; Fairness; Gender gap; Faculty teaching evaluation; Validity; Disparate impact";"STUDENT EVALUATION SCORES; RATINGS; VALIDATION; ETHNICITY; VALIDITY; COLLEGE; PROMOTION; TEACHERS; ISSUES; TENURE";How do we know if a faculty teaching evaluation is biased? Biasing factors studies are an influential source of evidence for arguing about biased teaching evaluations. These studies examine existing evaluation data and compare the results by gender, race, or ethnicity, interpreting a significant difference between subgroups as evidence of bias. However, only a difference explained by irrelevant aspects embedded in the evaluation would compromise its fairness. The study aims to amend how practitioners and researchers address gender bias concerns in faculty teaching evaluations by defining fairness, disparate impact, and statistical bias from an educational measurement standpoint. The study illustrates the use of differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, a strategy to examine whether the meaning of an item changes depending on the gender of the instructor. The study examines instructor's gender bias using responses to a course evaluation questionnaire from education graduate students from two academic departments within the same institution. In one of the departments, the analysis suggested a fair evaluation and no gender gap. In the other department, four of the eight items in the rating scale were easier for women than men with similar teaching ability, and women achieved better evaluations than men. The discussion addresses the conceptual and methodological advantages of adopting an educational measurement perspective on fairness in faculty teaching evaluation. Findings encourage practitioners and administrators to use the best available tools to strengthen the credibility of faculty teaching evaluations and prevent unfair personnel decisions affecting underrepresented subgroups in academia by gender, race, or ethnicity.;[Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile;;Valencia, E (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;envalenc@uc.cl;;;;;;74;2;2;7;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

The cost of the devices has hindered widespread use in schools, however, and cell phones have emerged as an attractive alternative. To test their functionality as a platform for collaborative educational activities, the authors adapted an existing Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) application for use on cell phones equipped with Wi-Fi. This article examines the problems of developing applications for this alternative technology and reports on a usability analysis of a collaborative classroom activity for teaching physics. The results confirm the viability of the cell phone platform, taking due account of the device's processing, network and interface limitations.

They were studied on the basis of questionnaires, interviews, observations and focus groups, all of which served to examine their teaching contexts and working conditions, how they recalled beginning to teach and its problems, their views about their profession and their work at the time of the study. The findings show interesting variations to those themes identified in the literature such as building of professional identity, their socialisation into schools, the relative weights of initial teacher education and experience, and the lack of support as they begin to teach.

Being able to engage digital information abilities to solve an information interaction activity within digital environments is key for social participation, equality and for bridging socio-economic and cultural gaps. Developing these abilities within school classrooms has become a priority. However, research suggest that a majority of students can only complete basic and explicit information-gathering and management tasks within digital environments. Literature constantly holds that students' expressed experiences of information interaction activities are key for developing digital information abilities. Notwithstanding, there are still important gaps within our understanding of students' expressed experiences of them. To address such gaps we employ phenomenography to study Chile's Secondary Technical and Vocational Education and Training students' expressed experiences of information interaction abilities; a group that has likewise been overlooked. By means of purposeful sampling, a total of 24 students participated in the study. Focusing on both the out-of and in-school settings, findings suggest that the apparent clear-cut division between the out-of and in-school experiencing seems not to be as pristine as some might suggest. Findings also indicate that specialty courses, as they are currently designed, might not be favorable for developing digital information abilities as well as pointing towards the importance of situating students' expressed experiences within wider discourses surrounding digital ability development.";"[Bolanos, Fernando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Doctorate Program, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile; [Salinas, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile";;Bolanos, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Doctorate Program, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile.;fbolnaos@uc.cl;Bolanos, Fernando/F-3805-2017;Bolanos, Fernando/0000-0003-0873-6672;Pontifical Catholic University of Chile's Vice-Rectorship for Research;This work was supported by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile's Vice-Rectorship for Research who provides scholarships to doctoral students of the University.;;60;1;1;0;14;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1360-2357;1573-7608;;EDUC INF TECHNOL;Educ.

Using a poststructural theoretical perspective, the qualitative study is focused on rural students' subjectivities, through the analysis of their narratives about their lives, their perceptions on secondary schooling, and their educational/labour perspectives about the future. The findings reveal the tensions between the certainty and uncertainty of a future. Specifically, of an educational and work path by which students seek to continue or diverge from the paths taken by previous generations. Here, education policies fail to offer a real upgrade in their future educational and lived conditions or aspirations.

The analysis is based on the concept of school trust, emphasizing Bryk and Tschannen-Moran's classic works. A mixed sequential quantitative-qualitative research methodology is used, including both a survey and a qualitative case study carried out in nine schools. The main results, include: principals and teachers take a different approach when forging trust they have in one another. While principals confer this trust, teachers earn it. Likewise, principals mainly set the tone, intensity and scope of the trust relationship; principals are more critical of teachers, mainly questioning certain aspects of their professional skills. Conversely, teachers normally base trust on more personal matters; individual traits of both principals and teachers have little impact on their relational trust, the exception being the number of years teachers have been on the job. While for teachers there are hardly any differences (and this changes only when it comes to the prevailing principal's leadership), among principals, differences emerge from schools' size, socio-economic level and public or private status; and a final discussion propounds the importance of the educational context when analysing trust relationships and positional power in schools.";"[Weinstein, Jose; Pena, Javiera] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Weinstein, Jose] CEDLE, Santiago, Chile; [Raczynski, Dagmar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Vergara 249,Tercer Piso, Santiago Ctr, Chile.;jose.weinstein@gmail.com;;;FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150526];The authors would like to acknowledge the support of FONDECYT (project number 1150526) and CEDLE.;;64;5;5;3;17;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

J;Bernasconi, A;;;;Bernasconi, Andres;;;Constitutional prospects for the implementation of funding and governance reforms in Latin American higher education;JOURNAL OF EDUCATION POLICY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"QUALITY-ASSURANCE; WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; POLICY; ENVIRONMENT; ECONOMY; SYSTEMS";The rationale for comprehensive reform of Latin American higher education crystallized in the mid 1990s in policy documents published by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. This 'Washington consensus' of the multilateral banks advocated, among other measures, greater reliance on private sources of funding, increased accountability, and a more effective management and governance structure for public universities in the region. A decade later, these prescriptions not only remain current, but have been somewhat bolstered by policy developments consistent with them in Europe, Asia and Australia. This article compares this reform agenda for funding and governance with the norms on higher education finance and control written in the current constitutions of the Latin American nations. Its purpose is to assess, from a juridical point of view, the viability of the policy prescriptions of that reform agenda for higher education. Major constitutional obstacles to cost recovery via tuition fees are provisions establishing the right to a free higher education in the public sector, while as to the matter of governance, in many countries in the region, the government is not constitutionally authorized to modify by mandate the governance structure of universities, which can only be defined by the institutions themselves.;Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Av Republ 330, Santiago, Chile.;abernasconi@unab.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;52;4;5;1;16;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0268-0939;;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

The model, which focuses on promoting educational sensitivity, comprises 5 group sessions. A pre-post evaluation of 157 participants was conducted by coding dyad and group interaction videos. After the intervention, a significant increase relative to the baseline was found in measures of dyad (d = 0.67) and group sensitivity (d = 0.13), among other positive outcomes. Likewise, a significant association was found between variables of dyadic sensitivity and group sensitivity, concurrently and prospectively. The promising results obtained support the viability of the model in early education.

In this article, we survey the affective economies of literary reading through a textual and visual analysis of documents issued by Chile's Ministry of Education. Through a critical and diffractive reading of these documents with Ahmed's (2004, 2010) and Braidotti's (2018) conceptualizations of the affective, we claim that when reading is presented as beneficial, pleasurable, and promising, an assemblage of exclusion is set into motion. We describe how the affective repertoires in these documents reinforce oppressive and exclusionary neoliberal values under the guise of the promise of future happiness. The pleasure and happiness that can be achieved through literary reading, however, is only accessible to those who are willing to orientate themselves in the right ways. In this orientation, the cognitive is privileged over the emotional, and readers are supposed to learn to postpone any current demands for the promise of future happiness.;"[Errazuriz, Valentina; Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Errazuriz, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.;"ve2147@tc.columbia.edu; mgarciay@uc.cl";;"Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena/0000-0001-8051-9969; Errazuriz, Valentina/0000-0003-0914-1021";;;;48;1;1;4;8;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0362-6784;1467-873X;;CURRICULUM INQ;Curric.

Participation in these platforms has increased practices of meaning-making associated with vernacular literacies. Digital production on Instagram articulates traditions from vernacular writing and photography and is characterized by the mass-circulation, hybridized genres and texts, and the centrality of the image. In this article, I examine the role of image as a precursor of meaning and writing on social media, and the functions and patterns of production present in the practices of 2 Chilean young people. The functions of documentary and testimony; self-expression and identity; sociality, audience, and participation are interwoven with each other and with the patterns that organize the knowledge associated with the production.

The research hypothesis is that the university's management, as a dependent variable, is impacted by self-assessment. The data gathering process was structured in three methodological steps: Step 1 considered the consistency analysis to evaluate the use of managerial language and visualize any consequences of planning documents after self-assessment. Step 2 involved the elaboration of a semi-structured interview that was applied to a sample of 12 key informants with the objective of encouraging qualitative categorization regarding the self-evaluation process and its effects. Step 3 entailed the construction of a questionnaire that would allow for a quantitative description. Several impacts have been reported analyzing the results from three main perspectives: organizational learning, cultural shift, and university and stakeholders.;"[Busco, Carolina] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Ind, Vergara 432, Santiago, Chile; [Dooner, Cecilia; d'Alencon, Andres] Univ Chile, Unidad Autoevaluac Acreditac & Calidad, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Chile";;"Busco, C (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Ind, Vergara 432, Santiago, Chile.; Dooner, C; d'Alencon, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Unidad Autoevaluac Acreditac & Calidad, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Chile.";"carolina.busco@udp.cl; cdooner@uchile.cl; dalencon.andres@gmail.com";;;;;;43;6;7;2;27;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Method: Participants were 23 childcare providers (nine teachers and 14 childcare technicians) who were evaluated with an average of three children each at one time. Stress associated to caregiving practices was assessed using the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), and caregiver sensitivity was measuring using the Child-Adult Relationship Experimental Index Toddlers (CARE-index). Results: No association was found between global level of stress and caregiver sensitivity. However, there was a significant association between the caregiver-child dysfunctional interaction subscale and caregiver sensitivity, specifically with the cognitive aspects of sensitive response and when a caregiver was nonresponsive. Furthermore, the 'Difficult Child' PSI subscale was associated with the cognitive aspects of the caregiver ' s sensitive response. Conclusions: These findings support the relevance of children's early interactions with their non-parental caregivers and demonstrate how daily stress can affect the cognitive aspects of the caregivers' sensitive response to the infants' needs.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile;;Santelices, MP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile.;msanteli@uc.cl;;Santelices, Maria-Pia/0000-0001-7473-1525;;;;47;2;2;0;25;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-293X;1752-1807;;EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC;Eur.

The ample literature on this topic reflects the debate about the contemporary role of this type of university. The present article describes the core models of these narratives, simply put as Humboldtian and Napoleonic, with their different evolutions and expressions in various contemporary higher education environments. The discussion shows that the ((idea of the public or state university, developed by these narratives, is quite dramatically different in the present day. Today the public university lacks a narrative, an explanation of itself, and a sense of how to account for new organizational forms and practices of knowledge production, transmission and management. Given these antecedents, the article makes proposals to refresh the practical discourse of public/state universities in Latin America and examines the possibility of a critical-deliberative model for both public and private universities.;UDP, CPCE, Santiago 8370056, Chile;;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), UDP, CPCE, Ejercito 260, Santiago 8370056, Chile.;josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com;BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021;;;;;33;14;16;1;17;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

Critics contend that vouchers increase the risk of stratification. Researchers have found that Chile's voucher program has lead to increased socioeconomic school segregation. What has been overlooked, however, is segregation between schools within a sector and variation within private for-profit and non-profit school sectors. I find that public schools are more likely to serve disadvantaged students than private voucher schools. I also find that disadvantaged students are more segregated among private voucher schools than among public schools. While between and within sector segregation levels vary across private voucher school types, the differences are not always consistent with theory. The data also suggest that policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the stratifying effects of educational vouchers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Most schools in Chile provide either primary or secondary education. The authors analyze the effect of private voucher education on students who are forced to enroll at a different school to attend secondary education once graduated from primary schooling-structural switches. Moreover, the data set the authors use in this article contains information on previous academic achievement and thus allows them to identify differences in students' unobservable characteristics. Using a number of propensity-score-based econometric techniques and the changes-in-changes estimation method, the authors find that private voucher education leads to small, sometimes not statistically significant differences in academic performance. The estimated effect of private voucher education amounts to about 4% to 6% of one standard deviation in test scores. In contrast, the literature on Chile based on cross-sectional data had previously found positive effects of about 15% to 20% of one standard deviation.;"[Lara, Bernardo; Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile.;"blara@ing.uchile.cl; amizala@dii.uchile.cl; andrea.repetto@uai.cl";"Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Repetto, Andrea/AAF-7404-2021";"Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741";;;;39;25;26;1;30;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0162-3737;1935-1062;;EDUC EVAL POLICY AN;Educ.

Naess's distinction between superficial and deep ecology along with Riechmann's negationist alternatives regarding the environmental problem are also stated. The article also briefly presents some of the main propositions to confront the environmental crisis: green capitalism, dematerialisation, decreasement, biomimesis Sumak Kausay, ethics of consumption, the downing principle and ending with the proposal of the necessary articulation between solidarity economy and sustainable development as well as with the identification of which should be the essential elements of both proposals.

These compositions produce different learning and social interaction results. The ability to change the group member composition in real time and dynamically enables the leveling up of learning results and improvements in the participants' social relationships. Changes in composition also facilitate the analysis of the best criteria to be used in a determined activity. We propose a face-to-face collaborative environment supported by wireless handhelds that allows for dynamic changes in the composition of groups while an activity is underway. Three different group composition changes were carried out in one environment and the outcomes were compared with another, similar environment where no such group composition changes were performed. The results obtained showed significant improvements, both qualitative and quantitative, in the environment where dynamic grouping was used.

To complete this study, I conducted 13 in-depth interviews and a focus group with five Chilean graduate international students who enrolled in an elite research university in the Northeastern region of the United States. The data raised questions about how social class is negotiated in both education and space, challenging how we understand the relationship between social class and education in a global context. I argue that through a process of international mobility, upper-class students from Chile lose class privilege, which in turn influences them to denaturalise their class constructions. Based on discussion of social class within the sociology of education and insights from whiteness studies, the results of my study enable a dialogue about how mobility affects individuals within an international context. I conclude that while international mobility demands students to rethink their class constructions, the affective disruption of silence and guilt emerge as two strategies to justify and perpetuate social class privilege.;[Munoz-Garcia, Ana Luisa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Munoz-Garcia, AL (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;aumunoz@uc.cl;;;;;;54;0;0;1;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0159-6306;1469-3739;;DISCOURSE-ABINGDON;Discourse;JAN 2;2021;42;1;;;SI;;102;113;;10.1080/01596306.2020.1855566;;DEC 2020;12;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;QP2EI;WOS:000596981500001;;;;;2022-04-06;

Two related entrepreneurial technologies of the self, namely, managerial leadership and ontological coaching, were identified. They were part of a regime of neoliberal subjectification unfolded in the mandatory modules to harness the working-class students' affective entrepreneurial vitalities as both the true ontology of their selves and the desirable features that make them the legitimate and responsible subjects of right to higher education.;[Leyton, Daniel] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Leyton, D (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile.;dleyton@uahurtado.cl;Leyton, Daniel/ABF-3998-2020;Leyton, Daniel/0000-0003-2472-9835;Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica;This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica.;;82;1;1;0;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0268-0939;1464-5106;;J EDUC POLICY;J.

The analysis is based on the discourse on the public/private divide in higher education scrutinising the opinion columns of El Mercurio, a major Chilean newspaper. The authors identify the discursive disappearance of the public university and the reappearance of the 'public' dimension connected to the private sector. The discourse of a 'diverse and mixed' system is accomplished by two discursive devices: (a) Reference to (selected) global trends and (b) Scientific expertise in higher education. The economic and discursive power of El Mercurio enhances the discourses of opinion columnists on the public/private divide.

To tap into their intuitions about fractions, students were presented with pairs of fractions on the screen for a limited time of 10s. Fraction pairs to be compared were controlled as to whether fractions shared or not a common component (numerator or denominator), as well as whether the greater fraction was the one with greater components or not. Data from about 500 students were processed with a clustering analysis based on these four item types, revealing distinct patterns of answers that we interpret in terms of strategies for answering the task. Half of the sample followed a simple larger-component-larger-fraction strategy as suggested by a congruency-based implementation of the natural number bias, although several clusters showed opposite patterns. These results show that a short, simple task can provide valuable information about students' individual differences in comparing fractions, useful for both research and practice in mathematics education. We discuss implications of these results for research and practice related to mathematics cognition and education.;"[Maximiliano Gomez, David] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile; [Maximiliano Gomez, David; Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, DIM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CMM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile";;"Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile.; Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile.";david.gomez@uoh.cl;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436;"CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; CONICYT/PCI Redes [150009]";"The authors are grateful to the students, teachers, personnel, and authorities of the five schools and the central administration of the school network that made possible this research; to Benjamin Bossi and Sergio Orellana for their assistance in collecting the data; and to Cristian Reyes and Wim Van Dooren for valuable discussions that helped in shaping this work and manuscript.

Twenty Chilean secondary education Social Studies teachers were invited to participate in a group interview and workshop to establish their conceptions of controversial issues and to design lesson plans for teaching such issues. The data showed that although teachers recognise some of the key elements that define these issues and recognise their pedagogical potential, they do not link them with learning the characteristics of social conflict and do not seek to deepen students' understanding of the actors and interests involved in such issues. The data reveal a tension between transmitting to students an interpretation of the traumatic issue in question and creating the conditions for students to analyse the different interpretations that may be in conflict. Therefore, to deploy the pedagogical potential of controversial issues, teachers need to refrain from expressing univocal truths and to question their position as owners and transmitters of knowledge.;"[Toledo Jofre, Maria Isabel; Gazmuri Stein, Renato] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile";;Jofre, MIT (corresponding author), Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile.;"maria.toledo@udp.cl; renato.gazmuri@udp.cl";;Toledo Jofre, Maria Isabel/0000-0002-5845-561X; [1120742];This paper was written in the framework of the FONDECYT Project 1120742.;;53;0;0;0;3;UNISA PRESS;PRETORIA;PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA;1682-3206;1947-9417;;EDUC CHANGE;Educ.

Educators as constructors of our own history;JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;;DILEMMAS;My professional interest originally focused on curriculum planning and development, but for the last 30 years I have been researching, publishing and teaching in the field of human rights education. Suddenly, I became a human rights educator. Suddenly? No, nothing in our personal and professional life is the result of an abrupt occurrence. We are subjects of a particular history, a succession of events and narratives, located in time, space and circumstances. I constructed myself, consciously or unconsciously, as a human rights educator as a consequence of many personal factors. Being the son of the first Rabbi in Chile, I felt, at a very early age, that I was different and suffered from discriminatory behaviour, prejudice and intolerance. In addition, I started to learn about the Holocaust. I lived in a poor neighbourhood and poverty had a profound impact on me. During the 1960s and 1970s many political changes took place in Chile. Severe human rights violations occurred, not only in Chile but also in the different contexts of many other Latin American countries. I became much more aware of, and sensitive to, human rights and their ethical implications. I decided to make use of my educational knowledge towards recovering democracy. I became a strong supporter of human rights education as an ethical and moral imperative throughout Latin America.;[Kolstrein, Abraham Magendzo] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Doctorate Program Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Kolstrein, AM (corresponding author), Camino Bodega 7173, Santiago 7660200, Chile.;abrahammagendzo@gmail.com;;;;;;12;1;1;0;0;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0305-7240;;;J MORAL EDUC;J.

Using student data from a sample of public primary schools in Chile, and considering for endogeneity and sample selection bias, they found two important results.

Previous research has shown that apprenticeship-based high schools (or dual vocational education) increase employment outcomes compared to school-based-only vocational education. Employing a propensity score matching design, we show that apprenticeship's advantages do not occur at the expense of academic outcomes: apprentices are 0.5 percentage points more likely to graduate on time (p = 0.068) and 3.3 percentage points more likely to access higher education (p = 0.000) than their non-apprentice counterparts.

These institutions depend to a certain extent on accreditation decisions to obtain indirect public funding. However, the system relies on faculty nominated by conglomerates formed by these same institutions to decide on accreditation. This arrangement creates a potential conflict of interest that can jeopardize the accreditation's legitimacy. We explore this potential bias through an empirical study examining voting behaviour by commissioners of the Chilean National Commission of Accreditation from March 2013 to October 2016. We assess whether commissioners appeared as favouring institutions within their appointing conglomerates. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the region designed to examine the presence of bias in higher education accreditation. Findings indicate commissioners, on average, tended to favour institutions in their appointing conglomerates. We discuss the findings in the broader context of a forthcoming reform of the accreditation system.;"[Barroilhet, Agustin] Univ Chile, Law Sch, Pio Nono 1, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Ortiz, Rocio; Quiroga, Bernardo F.; Silva, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile";;Quiroga, BF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile.;bfquirog@puc.cl;Quiroga, Bernardo F./W-2712-2018;Quiroga, Bernardo F./0000-0002-0465-0460;;;;37;2;2;3;5;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

This commitment becomes evident in the policies and legislation promoting inclusion and sanctioning violence in Chilean schools. The present empirical study analyses semi-structured interviews with teachers working in the Chilean southern regions Los Lagos and Los Rios, with the purpose of providing a description of teachers' practices when handling peer-to-peer violence. The evidence was qualitatively scrutinised so as to portray possible inclusive values in teachers' approaches to deal with violence among students in their work places. The results of this study disclose several inclusive values present in educators' practices, which suggests an intention to promote safety and inclusion for everyone. Notwithstanding the apparent teachers' efforts to provide their students with safe and inclusive establishments, the Chilean education system might need to strengthen the links among social services, schools and families. Therefore, having teachers whose practices show inclusive morals does not seem enough to ensure safe and inclusive schools, but rather complements the collaborative work that appears necessary among the different actors of the education system.;"[Soto Torres, Yesenia] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Inst Linguist & Literatura, Valdivia, Chile; [Soto Torres, Yesenia] Santa Pilar 780, Valdivia 5091280, Chile";;Torres, YS (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Linguist & Literatura, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.;yesenia.soto.t@gmail.com;;;Chilean Ministry of Education through the Advanced Human Capital Programme of the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [73160734];This work was supported by the Chilean Ministry of Education through the Advanced Human Capital Programme of the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), under [grant number 73160734].;;48;0;0;1;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

Using mixed methods research, we developed an instrument that identifies student interests. This instrument was applied in a pilot study that considered 10th-grade students from three schools in Santiago, Chile. We compared student interest and national curriculum for different factors and established how well aligned these are. The results reveal that private school students prefer subjects that require greater cognitive development, related to Young's powerful knowledge. Students from voucher schools, on the other hand, prefer to develop their knowledge of the arts and physical education, both of which are subjects they tend to enjoy. These findings are coherent with Bernstein's theories. This pattern is also repeated when comparing high-performing students with their low-performing counterparts, regardless of school type.

From its origin, artistic movements, ideologies, culture, technology and market demands, among many others, have continually modeled its epistemology and phenomenology. The Bauhaus, established a conception of Design almost a century ago but that is still valid in Latin America, even though its extreme dogmatism was the cause of its decline. In this opportunity, we review the influence of the Gothic, the Montessori pedagogy, the ideologies of the late nineteenth century, intuition and modernism, as central aspects in the original didactic and with it we have developed a simple classroom exercise, where they apply to identify the original elements that still prevail in the teaching practice of Design. These influences tend to be forgotten, but they have evolved since 1919, until decanting in the Design Thinking method, which, with the filters of contemporaneity, has put the own way of thinking and doing of the design at the disposal of other disciplines.;"[Donoso, Sergio] Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Dept Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile; [Mirauda, Pedro; Jacob, Ruben] Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Escuela Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile";;"Donoso, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Dept Diseno, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago 8331051, Chile.; Donoso, S (corresponding author), Fac Arquitectura & Urbanismo, Ave Portugal 84, Santiago, Chile.";"sergiodonoso@uchilefau.cl; pmirauda@gmail.com; rubenhjd@uchilefau.cl";Jacob-Dazarola, Ruben/K-1613-2016;Jacob-Dazarola, Ruben/0000-0002-6693-803X;;;;31;0;0;0;15;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

This holds in the ''normal'' case, but even more so under conditions when human rights education is initiated in order to counteract the effects and the terror of a military dictatorship. Experiences of this kind are described, as encountered when initiating a human rights education project in Chile and participating in related efforts in some other Latin American countries.

The PD workshop was held in Chile and promoted the use of collaborative problem-solving activities in the classroom, through monthly sessions during the school year. Participant teachers met with a monitor to solve a new problem collaboratively, plan a problem-solving activity for their next lesson, and reflect on their activities from their previous lesson. The study documents the performance of two groups of students when solving non-routine mathematics problems in two similar and non-equal tests consisting of three problems each, before and after the year of application of the workshop. The first group of students was the experimental group with collaborative problem-solving activities, as proposed in the PD workshop. The second group was the control group, composed of students whose teachers followed traditional teaching. In the first part of the paper we present the results of pre- and post-tests in which the students in the experimental group improved their problem-solving performance in a significant way compared with the control group. In the second part, we present a sample of representation strategy used by successful students in both groups and we discuss, in general, student strategies in solving test problems.;"[Saadati, Farzaneh; Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile";;"Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile.";pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl;;Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003, PAI AFB-170001]; CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673]";The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions, which improved the paper considerably.

Grounded in Deleuzoguattarian assemblage theory, we map the multiplicities produced by the collision between social justice research practices and 'vulnerability' as a pervading category within the contemporary education policyscape. Analyzing a short film created by students labeled as 'at risk', we expose that educational policies aimed at addressing social vulnerability invent 'the future' as only habitable for those who materialize able-bodiedness. However, crip futurities also emerge throughout the short film, showing that non-normative expressions of the human can actualize themselves using research as a milieu. These simultaneous and asymmetrical ways of expressing humanness illuminate how intricate the affective relation between research and neoliberal policy is. We conclude by discussing the power of research-assemblages for disorienting ableist biopedagogies and legitimizing futures other than those of compulsory able-bodiedness.;"[Araneda, Carlos; Infante, Marta] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Infante, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;minfantj@uc.cl;;Araneda-Urrutia, Carlos/0000-0003-0962-3960;Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development under grant Fondecyt [1130616];This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development under grant Fondecyt, [No1130616].;;58;0;0;0;0;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-8487;1750-8495;;CRIT STUD EDUC;Crit.

A bias may increase or decrease scores and change the relationship with other variables. In contrast, SET literature defines bias as an irrelevant variable correlated with SET scores, and among many, a relevant biasing factor in literature is the instructor's gender. The study examines the extent to which acquiescence, the tendency to endorse the highest response option across items and bias in the first sense affects students' responses to a SET rating scale. The study also explores how acquiescence affects the difference in teaching quality (TQ) by instructor's gender, a bias in the latter sense. SET data collected at a faculty of education in Ontario, Canada were analysed using the Rasch rating scale model. Findings provide empirical support for acquiescence affecting students' responses. Latent regression analyses show how acquiescence reduces the difference in TQ by instructor's gender. Findings encourage greater attention to the response process quality as a way to better defend the utility of SET and prevent potentially misleading conclusions from the analysis of SET data.;[Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile;;Valencia, E (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.;envalenc@uc.cl;Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019;Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272;;;;57;6;6;0;12;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0260-2938;1469-297X;;ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU;Assess.

In particular, feedback in elementary school students has not been thoroughly studied. Within this scope, studying the effectiveness of different degrees and types of feedback for primary school students becomes relevant. The present study looks at two types of feedback designed for problem-solving in primary school: Knowledge of Results and Elaborated Feedback. A series of interactive problems was designed for tablets to cover a range of topics for fifth-grade mathematics. Through a quasi-experimental design, one group of students (n = 31) was provided with Elaborated Feedback, while another group (n = 33) was provided with Knowledge of Results. Feedback was given to the students as they worked on the interactive problems over 6 sessions. The effectiveness of both types of feedback was then measured using a pre- and post-test. Although Elaborated Feedback helped the students achieve better results during the sessions, the Knowledge of Results group scored higher on the post-test. The results add to the growing debate on the supposed benefits of providing increasing levels of information or guidance, in an area that shows scarce and contradicting evidence.;"[Caceres, Martin; Nussbaum, Miguel; Gonzalez, Fernando; Gardulski, Vicente] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile";;Caceres, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.;mecacere@uc.cl;Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Caceres, Martin/0000-0002-0388-5508";FONDECYT(Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico)/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1180024];This research was funded by FONDECYT(Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico)/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1180024].;;65;2;2;5;24;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1049-4820;1744-5191;;INTERACT LEARN ENVIR;Interact.

Portrayals of school mathematics within this sample involved multiple story lines, including school mathematics as being obligatory but not useful and mathematics classes as tense, terrible, difficult, and different but perhaps as places in which to find love.

However, collaboration does not occur spontaneously; instead it needs to be guided by appropriate scaffolding. In this study we explore whether a script that explicitly incorporates constructing arguments in collaborative problem-solving activities improves learning. In order to do so, a study was conducted involving 75 students from a lower-middle class state-subsidized private school in Santiago de Chile. These students were divided into three groups, each of which worked on geometry activities over 10 sixty-minute sessions that were held across a period of four weeks. To isolate the effect of incorporating technology, the first of these groups did not work with technology. The second group worked with a collaborative script that was developed for use with a tablet, while the third group used the same technology with an integrated tool that explicitly allowed the students to build arguments. We conclude that having students reflect on their own processes and outcomes by arguing their point of view can lead to an improvement in learning, more so than the technology itself.";"[Caceres, M.; Nussbaum, M.; Marroquin, M.; Gleisner, S.; Marquinez, J.

J;Matus, C;;;;Matus, Claudia;;;The uses of affect in education: Chilean government policies;DISCOURSE-STUDIES IN THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Uses of affect; policy in education; regulation; production of the good student and family; Chile";;"This article draws attention to the uses of affect to produce specific subjectivities and moralities in educational policies. It highlights the connections between specific ideas of the educated subject, the family role presented in governmental educational policies in Chile, and the ways these ideas are linked to the subjectivities and communities which the market requires to function. My argument is that with different intensities, affect regulation has become a strategic component of a government that articulates the relation between 'right ways to behave at home' and 'school success'.

I use discourse analysis to show how these policies use affect to control and monitor behaviors and personal relations, as well circulating cultural logics and ideological structures.

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.;"[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile";;"Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.";darraghlisa3@gmail.com;, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710;CIAE Project from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FB0003];I wish to acknowledge the Centre for Advanced Research in Education (CIAE, Santiago, Chile), for enabling the writing of this article due to funding from CIAE Project FB0003 from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica.;;92;69;71;2;31;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

Governance refers here to the manner in which these institutions are organized and internally operated -i.e., their authority and management structures and processes- and to their external relations with various stakeholders in order to ensure the higher educations aims. A hypothesis commonly found in specialized literature is used as a starting point: that successful university organizations are those able to modify their governance -that is, their institutional command and control structures and management, to adapt to the changing demands of their environment and the transformation of its basic structures. A basic typology of higher education governance regimes is offered -i.e., bureaucratic, collegial, of stakeholders and entrepreneurial-, and their change-producing forces and evolutionary trends are identified, as well as the displacements of their corresponding center of gravity both within and between regimes.To this end examples are drawn from the history of modern universities in developed countries, both in the so-called Humboldtian and Napoleonic traditions. Finally, changing university governance circumstances and their peculiarities in Latin America are discussed. We explore tensions between traditional values of university self-governance based on broad electoral participation and values pertaining to entrepreneurial management; also between values assigned to higher education as a public good and shortcomings attributed to the private production of higher education.";Univ Diego Portales, CPCE, Santiago 7510216, Chile;;Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, CPCE, Hernando de Aguirre 731, Santiago 7510216, Chile.;josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com;BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021;Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237;;;;47;31;34;2;32;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

J;GARCIAHUIDOBRO, JE;;;;GARCIAHUIDOBRO, JE;;;POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION - ITS JUSTIFICATION AND A CHILEAN EXAMPLE;INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Educational policies in Latin America have centred on two main issues: raising the quality of education, and improving the equity of its distribution. Access to schooling was until recently at the heart of the debate, the degree of justice of the educational systems being measured by their capacity to enrol and retain the population. Attention is now concentrated on the strength of the cultural resources offered by schools and the effectiveness of provision. Learning is the priority of education policy. This article develops the theme of equity, examining the concept and describing a programme which focuses on improving the equity of the Chilean educational system. It is suggested that educational equity should no longer mean equality of access but equality of results. A just system therefore needs to concentrate on raising the quality of schools serving the poorest sectors of society. The Chilean ''900 Schools Programme'' is an example. Its aim was to raise levels of achievement by improving the learning of poor children from 1st to 4th grade in reading, writing and mathematics. To do so, it improved the school environment, textbooks and methodologies, and offered support to children outside school hours by the work of community monitors.;;;GARCIAHUIDOBRO, JE (corresponding author), MINIST EDUC,MECE BASICA PROGRAMA,SATTIAGO,CHILE.;;;;;;;0;6;7;0;1;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0020-8566;;;INT REV EDUC;Int.

The study concludes that although there are statistically significant differences in the evaluations, these differences are gradually decreasing. The criteria with statistically significant differences throughout the years studied are complex and may be influenced by the latent criteria of both actors, the training expectations of the tutor and the contextual expectations of the mentor.

Lecturers often lack the tools they need to guide their students, while also taking into consideration their individual needs. This study proposes an expandable strategy for introducing active learning following a metacognitive approach involving problem-based learning and anonymous peer assessment. The approach was implemented over two sessions as part of a 16-week business management class taken by 223 students. The results reveal that students were able to develop both their management and critical thinking skills at the same time. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a metacognitive approach, where students discovered their own knowledge gaps and developed their critical thinking skills, and 2) an active learning approach suitable for large classes, where students received teacher guidance and individualised feedback from their peers.;"[Rodriguez, Maria Fernanda; Nussbaum, Miguel; Pertuze, Julio; Avila, Carlos; Caceres, Joaquin; Valenzuela, Tomas; Ceppi, Bastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Rodriguez, MF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;mfrodri3@uc.cl;Pertuze, Julio/E-6338-2014;Pertuze, Julio/0000-0002-3565-3672;"FONDECYT projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180024]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [2018- 21181986]";We are grateful for the support received from FONDECYT project 1180024, as well as the financial support received from CONICYT grant 2018- 21181986 for doctoral studies.;;43;0;0;2;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1470-3297;1470-3300;;INNOV EDUC TEACH INT;Innov.

Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs' visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master's and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs' new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work. To some extent, accreditation standards, based on strong disciplinary orientations, penalize a diverse student body and curricular innovation and do not consider the challenges of publishing multidisciplinary research.;"[Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Veliz, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Celis, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, FCFM, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile.;scelis@ing.uchile.cl;;Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608;;;;34;0;0;1;10;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

We investigate the factors affecting the maintenance and decline of cognitive demand in the implementation of a statistics lesson by two teachers who participated in a Lesson Study group for third graders (8-9 years old). The results of the investigation show notable changes in the maintenance factors associated with the teachers' questions and feedback, the scaffolding provided for the students' reasoning and the modelling of high-level performance. In terms of the decline in the level of cognitive demand, the greatest changes were found in factors corresponding to the routinization of problematic aspects of the task and to problems in lesson management. Based on the results of our collaborative work with teachers in the context of Lesson Study, we conclude that it is possible to design and implement statistical tasks in primary school classrooms that maintain high cognitive demand.;"[Estrella, Soledad; Zakaryan, Diana; Olfos, Raimundo; Espinoza, Gonzalo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile";;Estrella, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile.;"soledad.estrella@pucv.cl; diana.zakaryan@pucv.cl; raimundo.olfos@pucv.cl; gonzalo.espinoza.v@gmail.com";"Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022; Espinoza-Vásquez, Gonzalo/ABB-1251-2021; Zakaryan, Diana/L-5569-2018";"Espinoza-Vásquez, Gonzalo/0000-0003-4500-4542; estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914; Zakaryan, Diana/0000-0002-3400-8399";FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140472, 11140092, 1171076];This research acknowledges financial support from FONDECYT Project Nos. 11140472, 11140092 and 1171076.;;30;7;8;3;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1386-4416;1573-1820;;J MATH TEACH EDUC;J.

However, there are relatively few studies that help us understand when or why this method has a positive effect on students, so as to aid the design of a flipped class. In this study, an instrument for assessing the student learning experience in flipped courses is proposed and validated, comparing the results of their application over two semesters in a university-level programming class with three flipped sections (n = 151) and four conventional ones (n = 226). We found that with a similar score in terms of learning experience, the achievement in a flipped course is slightly higher than in a lecture-based course, F(1,108) = 4.20, p = 0.04, d = 0.19. A multiple regression analysis was conducted for the effect on achievement of GPA, level of challenge, feedback and enjoyment. By controlling for these factors, students in flipped classes achieved higher scores than students in lecture-based courses, beta = 0.1, t(370) = 2.4, p = 0.02. The expected improvement in achievement increases when features of the flipped classroom improve the student experience. Our results suggest that the design of a flipped class should consider the effect of different implementation features on student experience in order to select the most appropriate ones for a particular context.;"[Schwarzenberg, Pablo; Navon, Jaime; Nussbaum, Miguel; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Caballero, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Schwarzenberg, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"phschwarzenberg@uc.cl; jnavon@ing.puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; mar.perez@ing.puc.cl; dccaball@uc.cl";"Navon, Jaime/D-9095-2014; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014";"Navon, Jaime/0000-0003-4960-8386; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; Schwarzenberg, Pablo/0000-0002-7753-353X";"CONICYT-PCHA/doctorado Nacional [2013-21130045]; FONDECYT-CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; MOOC Maker EU Project [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]";This work was funded by grant CONICYT-PCHA/doctorado Nacional/2013-21130045, FONDECYT-CONICYT 11150231 and the MOOC Maker EU Project (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP).;;45;17;20;7;61;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1726;1867-1233;;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

In Chile, research on teacher quality has predominantly relied on cross-sectional data, and largely focused on identifying teacher attributes related to teaching quality. Only have few studies addressed the problem of non-random assignment of students to teachers. This paper attempts to fill these gaps. On the basis of pseudo-longitudinal data for 2011 from the Education Quality Measurement System and teachers' administrative records, we employed value-added and fixed-effect models correcting for sorting-bias, to assess the overall contribution of teachers to student achievement and identify which teacher characteristics enhance teacher effectiveness. We find that teacher contribution to students' learning in mathematics and language is very significant. In addition, teaching experience has a significant non-linear impact on test scores in math but not in reading. Both junior and senior teachers are effective in the educational system.

Although there has been much interest in this relationship, and several empirical studies have been conducted, the mechanism through which dialogue promotes learning remains unclear. There is compelling evidence to show that group work argumentation prompts student concept gains, especially when tests are taken weeks, after group collaboration; in other words, there are delayed effects. There is no conclusive empirical evidence about the mechanism through which discussions lead to conceptual growth. Moreover, gains are not related to group outcomes or resolutions, showing that the internalization of negotiated meanings is unlikely to be responsible for gains. This paper aims to develop a sociocultural hypothesis of the effects of group-work argumentation on conceptual gains, shedding light on the role that inner argumentative speech may play in this developmental relationship.";[Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile;;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017;Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516;Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140995, 1170431];This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) projects no. 1140995 and no. 1170431.;;72;10;10;1;23;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2210-6561;;;LEARN CULT SOC INTER;Learn.

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices.;"[Araya, Roberto; Dartnell, Pablo; Soto-Andrade, Jorge] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Araya, R (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Periodista Carrasco 75, Santiago, Chile.;robertoaraya@automind.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Soto-Andrade, Jorge/I-9424-2017";Soto-Andrade, Jorge/0000-0003-1120-2911;;;;0;5;7;0;9;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

Despite increases in access, course completion rates remain problematic in Chile. Students' expectations of higher education can play an important role in their decision-making, especially in terms of choices made about programme and institution. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand Chilean high school students' expectations of the benefits and costs involved in the transition process from secondary to postsecondary education. Also, it aimed to examine the factors that influence those expectations. Method: We used a qualitative design to collect information from 76 university-tracked high-school seniors through nine focus groups. All focus group data were double coded using a directed content analysis approach. Findings: The analysis indicated that students mentioned expectations of non-monetary benefits frequently, and in all focus groups. Though monetary benefits were not referred to directly, students identified them implicitly through non-monetary benefits. Expectations about costs were mentioned less often than were benefits. Conclusions: Our study highlights that the construction of expectations appeared chiefly influenced by the information obtained through family and peers. The findings from this study should help focus institutional and educational policymakers' efforts in supporting the decision-making process of students transitioning to higher education.;"[Guzman, Pamela; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo; Santelices, Maria Veronica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman, Pamela] Millennium Nucleus Student Experience Higher Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;paguzmans@uc.cl;"Guzman, Pamela/G-9461-2018; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo/G-9470-2018";"Guzman, Pamela/0000-0003-3469-6440; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo/0000-0002-9317-7483";"Chile's Ministry of Science through project Millennium Nucleus, Student Experience in Higher Education in Chile: Expectations and Realities, Chile; Chile's Ministry of Science through project Informacion y Decisiones en la Trayectoria Tecnico Profesional [Fondecyt] [1211883]; Chile's Ministry of Science through project El Rol de la Informacion en la Toma de Decisiones de Alumnos en Transicion a la Educacion Superior [Fondecyt] [1160871]";"This article was partially funded by Chile's Ministry of Science through projects.

In contexts where knowledge and skills predominate due to test-driven education policies, teacher preparation programs must incorporate dispositions to ensure holistic teacher education. In that light, a set of dispositions for an English Language Teacher program in Chile has been identified through an exploratory mixed-method study. Results contribute to establishing a definition for dispositions, understood as context-relevant intellectual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal teacher attributes. This paper, exploratory in nature, makes a case for other teacher education programs to emulate the process and pursue better understanding of teacher dispositions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is not yet enough research about the role that multimodal texts play in scaffolding student reading comprehension of complex scientific processes, such as energy transfer. This study explored how verbal and visual resources (scaffolding level) and individual differences (reading skills) contribute to science reading comprehension. One-hundred and sixty Chilean fifth-graders were assessed on reading skills, vocabulary, and prior science knowledge. A counterbalanced design was used to test two groups: Group 1 reads a text with low multimodal scaffolding and Group 2 reads a text with high multimodal scaffolding. Level of text scaffolding was determined by (1) image function, (2) visual-verbal relations, (3) presence of an explicit explanatory structure, and (4) lexico-grammatical resources. General monomodal and multimodal science reading comprehension were assessed with multiple-choice tests. An ANCOVA analysis revealed non-significant differences between groups after controlling for prior knowledge, fluency, and vocabulary. Likewise, a two-factor ANCOVA analysis showed that the high-multimodal scaffolding text significantly boosted science reading comprehension for low-skilled comprehenders. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for pedagogy and research, aiming to foster multimodal literacy for learning in content areas.;"[Meneses, Alejandra; Veliz, Soledad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Off 01, Santiago 7820436, RM, Chile; [Escobar, Jose-Pablo; Veliz, Soledad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Santiago, Chile";;Meneses, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Off 01, Santiago 7820436, RM, Chile.;amenesea@uc.cl;"Escobar, José-Pablo/AAB-3688-2021; ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017";"Escobar, José-Pablo/0000-0001-9749-0285; ";"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant VRI Interdisciplina 27/2013; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant Proyecto Basal de Centros de Investigacion Interdisciplinaria";This work was supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant VRI Interdisciplina 27/2013 and under Grant Proyecto Basal de Centros de Investigacion Interdisciplinaria.;;55;8;8;4;32;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0950-0693;1464-5289;;INT J SCI EDUC;Int.

The theoretical model used considers the study of the constitution of knowledge through the analysis of its genesis, development and transversality. The results reveal in the analyzed work an episteme of the measurement of inaccessible distances that includes both the search for a suitable reason to carry out the measurement and the dynamic analysis of the behavior of the shadows or the visual rays in the estimation of inclinations.

Using national test score data, it confirms the findings from previous literature that ethnic gaps in educational achievement exist, though they are small and to a large extent explained by family socioeconomic status. The results indicate that school composition with respect to the socioeconomic background and indigenous status of students matters for academic achievement. Controlling for the student's socioeconomic background, the ethnic composition of the school attended is associated with student achievement. In schools where the ethnic composition is higher than the national average, the test score disadvantage of indigenous students is larger, especially for those students whose parents both identify as indigenous.

The main features of the course are the use of i) problem solving activities related with mathematical knowledge for teaching fractions ii) peer discussions and iii) monitor's interventions focused on answering with questions. The objective of this paper is to present some insights on how this type of course may contribute to the development of teachers' knowledge for teaching fractions. To do that we analyze in depth the case of one teacher, using the recording of his work during the course (video, audio, and written documents), his answers to two questionnaires and his responses to an interview six months after the course. Results show how the course's features contributed to the development of this teacher's specific fractions knowledge, knowledge of fractions and students, and of fractions and teaching.;"[Perdomo-Diaz, Josefa; Felmer, Patricio; Randolph, Valeria; Gonzalez, Guillermo] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;"Perdomo-Diaz, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile.; Perdomo-Diaz, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.";pepiperdomo@gmail.com;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Perdomo-Diaz, Josefa/L-2405-2017";"Perdomo-Diaz, Josefa/0000-0002-7098-1030; Randolph, Valeria/0000-0003-3456-9193";"CMM BasalComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL; CIAE Project from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT [FB 0003]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3140597, EDU2011-29328, EDU2015-65270-R]; FONDEF [ID4I10338]";This research was supported by the projects: CMM Basal, CIAE Project FB 0003 from the Associative Research Program of CONICYT, Fondecyt 3140597, EDU2011-29328 and EDU2015-65270-R projects and FONDEF project ID4I10338.;;20;4;5;0;7;MODESTUM LTD;LONDON;STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND;1305-8215;1305-8223;;EURASIA J MATH SCI T;Eurasia J.

Through the use of an education production function, this article estimates the effect of variables related to health status, cognitive abilities, and demographic factors of Chilean mothers and children on the children's psychomotor development. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, which provides measures of children's biopsychosocial development through the application of a psychomotor development test (TEPSI) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (TVIP). In turn, the application of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) test to the mother allows an estimation of the role that her cognitive ability plays in the psychomotor development of the child. The results show that health, cognitive, and demographic variables are important factors in a child's biopsychosocial development. In the general model, the measures of cognitive ability have a greater impact than the other variables and, in all specific models, they are significant. Additionally, demographic variables and those related to the family environment have a greater impact than health variables. The child's attendance at preschool has a positive impact on psychomotor development, as measured by the TEPSI, and is even more important than the mother's employment status. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study's main objective is to characterise, from students' perspectives, teachers who have more authority, identifying differences by school. The study sample were 514 secondary school students, from six schools in the city of Santiago. The results indicate that students agree that teachers who exert greater authority are characterised for developing excellent teaching, establishing affective bonds with them, and applying strict behaviour norms. Finally, the study concludes by discussing the new meanings of authority that these students from poor areas of Chile are developing.;[Zamora-Poblete, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Zamora-Poblete, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"gzamora@puc.cl; gabrielapperez@gmail.com";Zamora, Guillermo/B-2067-2017;Zamora, Guillermo/0000-0002-9530-9144;;;;22;1;2;0;14;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC;Cult.

Nonetheless, institutional initiatives to support writing processes are relatively recent and not necessarily research-grounded. This systematic literature review aims to address this gap by answering the questions: What obstacles and facilitators in the writing process do doctoral students encounter in the areas of SS&H? And what clues do these offer about students' needs for institutional support? To do so, we focus on empirical student-centred research. Systematizing the evidence may strengthen pedagogical decisions and programmatic orientations focused on the students' experiences and writing processes. We analysed a total of 38 studies on these topics collected from mainstream databases and identified patterns of recurring results that illustrate obstacles and facilitators from which the needs arise. Negative self-perceptions and low self-regulation are among the main obstacles of the writing process, while shared writing experiences foster affective dimensions self-regulation, and improve familiarisation with the discursive community. Lastly, institutional spaces specifically dedicated to writing as well as sustained positive and constructive feedback emerged as needs.;"[Calle-Arango, Lina; Avila Reyes, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin, Santiago 4860, Chile";;Calle-Arango, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin, Santiago 4860, Chile.;linacallearango@gmail.com;Calle-Arango, Lina/G-9459-2018;Calle-Arango, Lina/0000-0003-4362-3075;Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, ANID [folio 21180042];This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, ANID, under Grant folio 21180042.;;78;1;1;4;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0158-037X;1470-126X;;STUD CONTIN EDUC;Stud.

Analysing face-to-face peer-group classroom argumentation is challenging. There are very good analytic frameworks, but their usefulness for analysing large corpora and conducing quantitative analysis is not clear, as reliability and validity measures are often not reported. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and psychometric properties of a coding scheme to analyse argumentative moves during group-work interaction. The coding scheme was used to analyse 321 videos of fourth-grade students' group work during science lessons (unit of Forces) oriented by the same instructional design. Evidence was gathered during three experimental studies randomized at class level. We ran reliability and validity analyses. The results suggest that the coding scheme can be reliable used (in terms of both inter-rater and scale reliability) and allow to make valid inferences, and can be used to systematically relate both individual and group argumentation to individual outcomes.;"[Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Avda Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile; [Freire, Paulina; Strasser, Katherine; Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;"alarrain@uahurtado.cl; pcfreire@uc.cl; kstrasse@uc.cl; vgrau@uc.cl";"; Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017";"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516";"Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431]; Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF), under Grant FONDEF IDeA [ID14I10094]";This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants n degrees 1140995 and 1170431, and Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF), under Grant FONDEF IDeA ID14I10094.;;60;2;2;1;13;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

It is a seductive policy. This article is based on the case of Chile, which in recent decades has consolidated a performative school market model. The study is based on an examination of official speeches and policy documents (a total of 84 documents), from the germination of the model in 1979 through to 2011 when the Quality Assurance Education System law was passed. Following Foucault's studies in governmentality, the analysis not only aims to understand the policies that led to the creation of the hyper-surveillance state in education, but also seeks to examine the policy rationale that made these transformations desirable. The research analysis is also intended to contribute to a broader understanding of the spread of testing and accountability policies around the world.;[Falabella, Alejandra] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Erasmo Escala 1825, Santiago 8340539, Chile;;Falabella, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Erasmo Escala 1825, Santiago 8340539, Chile.;afalabel@uahurtado.cl;;FALABELLA, ALEJANDRA/0000-0003-2755-4911;"National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt); National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170477]";The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt), National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt) [Grant number 1170477].;;85;9;13;2;5;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0013-161X;1552-3519;;EDUC ADMIN QUART;Educ.

This achievement is measured using performance in standardized reading and mathematics tests. The study also evaluates the effect of a policy that recognizes and increases resources for special educational needs that had not yet been considered and improves education provision protocols for students with SEN. Using administrative data and standardized test scores, we constructed a panel that follows a cohort of students before and after the reform, determining for each individual and year whether the class to which he/she belongs has any students with SEN. Our identification strategy employs panel data with fixed effects at the school, individual, and time levels. Estimates show that, on average, having a peer with SEN in the classroom has a negative effect on the academic performance of students without SEN. However, these effects are small and decrease, or even vanish, once better inclusion policies are in place. These results suggest that the effect on peers is almost totally canceled when more resources are provided and when adequate treatment and support protocols are implemented.;"[Contreras, Dante; Brante, Miguel; Espinoza, Sebastian; Zuniga, Isabel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile";;Contreras, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.;"contreras.dante@gmail.com; mbrante@fen.uchile.cl; seespinoza@fen.uchile.cl; isabel.zunigad@gmail.com";;Espinoza Rojas, Sebastian/0000-0002-8678-1201;"Centre for Social Conflict; Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]";Dante Contreras acknowledges the financial support provided by the Centre for Social Conflict and the Millennium Nucleus of Social Development, which is supported Cohesion Studies by the Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009).;;27;3;3;0;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0738-0593;1873-4871;;INT J EDUC DEV;Int.

Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere.;"[Alo, Dominique] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Alo, Dominique; Castillo, Andrea; Marin Vial, Paula; Samaniego, Horacio] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Lab Ecoinformat, Valdivia, Chile; [Samaniego, Horacio] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Samaniego, Horacio] Inst Sistemas Complejos Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;"Alo, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile.; Alo, D (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Lab Ecoinformat, Valdivia, Chile.";dominiquealo@gmail.com;"Alò, Dominique/AAC-9127-2019; Samaniego, Horacio/O-8820-2015";"Alò, Dominique/0000-0003-0579-4156; Samaniego, Horacio/0000-0002-2485-9827; Castillo, Andrea G/0000-0002-7577-0697; Marin, Paula/0000-0001-5242-7020";"EXPLORA-CONICYT [ED190018]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) Doctoral FellowshipComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21150634]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT-CONICYT) [116280]";We thank EXPLORA-CONICYT for funding 'Ecoinformatica para Jovenes', Project ED190018.

Our goal is to provide ideas on future research topics and raise issues for further exploration. This research was conducted through a systematic review of articles published in the last decade in the WOS and Scopus databases. Upon reflection, we suggest the need for inclusive e-learning educational designs with greater emphasis on human diversity in all of its complexity.

Searching in groups is a daily practice across multiple contexts; however, the tools we use for searching online do not enable collaborative practices and traditional search models consider a single user navigating online in solitary. This paper presents a three level conceptual model, called the Collaborative Search Procedural Model, which enables the implementation of collaborative search classroom activities based on multi-user collaborative search scripts. A software solution, CollSearch, which follows the Collaborative Search Procedural Model and offers a unified tool to enable collaborative searching computer-supported classroom activities, is also presented. Empirical evaluation of the tool with high school students as part of an English as a second language course shows that students' outcomes improve when compared to non-scripted group search. Results show that by following the Collaborative Search Procedural Model students better appropriate the work they build together with their group. The OECD has highlighted the importance of collaborative work by the fact that PISA 2015 will assess collaborative problem solving; collaborative search is a fertile field for fostering better group work interactions.

Methodology: an action-research methodology was used with three intervention phases: first, training in the use of graphic organisers of a group of academics who were expert in didactics; second, training of a group of pedagogy students in the methodological use of graphic organisers and, third, instructional design for the IGO's integration in secondary school curricula through these students' on-the-job training. Results: first, the application of a questionnaire on information and communication technology (ICT) skills shows that pedagogy students are good users of office automation applications and Internet but lack preparation for implementing meaningful learning experiences using ICT. Second, after the training process on interactive graphic organisers, each student prepared a curricular design incorporating the IGO as the teaching and learning process articulator. Third, as a result of implementing these curricular designs in schools, the pedagogy students valued this innovation in their didactic practices. Discussion: the findings demonstrate that the adequate integration of technology such as the IGO in the curriculum facilitates not only improvements in the teaching and learning process, from its design to its execution, but also constitutes an interesting didactic resource to develop basic cognitive skills, at the same time enhancing future teachers' ICT skills. Conclusions: the study's results confirm that the IGO's adequate curricular integration substantially improves the didactics of the discipline in which it is incorporated.";"[Ponce, Hector R.; Lopez, Mario J.; Labra, Juan E.; Toro, Oscar A.] Univ Santiago Chile, VirtualLab USACH, Santiago, Chile";;Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Av LB OHiggins 3363 Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile.;hector.ponce@usach.cl;Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019;;;;;31;1;2;2;23;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;;;REV EDUC;Rev.

Drawing on the concept of coloniality, this paper examines curricular and teaching practices in higher education that aim to decolonise Latin American universities, a particular topic that has been under-investigated. By means of a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis, 40 papers authored by at least one scholar affiliated to a Latin American university were examined. The analysis identified three levels of educational practices (macro, meso and micro) that revolve around the principle of intercultural indigenous education. Further, six essential criteria (cultural, epistemological, relational, ecological, economic, political) in decolonising university education are proposed. The paper concludes by offering insights about decolonising curricula and teaching practices in universities and the ways in which decolonial educational initiatives based on critical border thinking and socialisation of power might transform Latin American universities.;[Guzman Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile;;Valenzuela, CG (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;ANID-FONDECYT Chile [1200633];This work was supported by ANID-FONDECYT Chile: [Grant Number Project number 1200633].;;64;3;3;0;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1356-2517;1470-1294;;TEACH HIGH EDUC;Teach.

This study considers the historical context which sees Chile adding, to considerable Latin American immigration, selected cohorts of humanitarian refugees from the other side of the world, in this case, Farid, a boy from Baghdad's Palestinian community who arrived with his family in Chile after living two years in the Al-Tanf camp. Based on a qualitative approach, including three ninety-minute interviews, the study considers Farid's pre-, peri- and post-immigration experiences, paying special attention to instances and processes of integration and exclusion in the Chilean school context. The research contributes to understanding the refugee experience in a country broadly unfamiliar with the reception of highly vulnerable people from markedly different cultures. Ultimately, the inclusion of refugees is a challenge and an opportunity for an education system and a society connecting ever more intricately with the wider world.;"[Leihy, Pete] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Educ, San Joaquin, Chile; [Arancibia Martini, Hector] Univ Valparaiso, Humanidades & Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Leihy, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile.;peodair@gmail.com;Martini, Héctor Arancibia/AAD-2128-2019;"Martini, Héctor Arancibia/0000-0003-2850-1424; Leihy, Peodair/0000-0002-5569-0905";Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170397];This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [grant number 3170397].;;43;0;0;3;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

Teachers and researchers worldwide are rethinking 'multiliteracies pedagogy' and 'multiliterate learning environments' to design innovative and meaningful educational spaces for young children. They pursue to better account for the role (and entanglement) of spaces, places, materiality, bodies, and power in early childhood education pedagogies. Multiliterate learning environments research offers the possibility to reconceptualize early childhood classrooms as real sites of thinking revolution and unique spaces for theorizing new contours of literacy pedagogy. This study explored and elicited early childhood teachers' thinking and making multiliterate learning environments, with an ethnographic approach. We designed a single-case study emplaced in a university's laboratory preschool. The participant observation took place for five months and had two different outspreading moments. First, to explore and familiarize with the preschool culture and to penetrate the learning environment codes, and the second, to produce ethnographic data collaboratively with in-depth interviews. Findings show that teachers' design thinking process is culturally situated and 'child interest- driven,' enabling some child agency in spatial meaning-making as co-authors of the multiliterate learning environments they inhabit. The design thinking process unfolds through an ongoing iterative and collaborative four-phased-cycle. Teachers ideate and reflect on multiliteracies and place-making decisions that materialize learning environments based on the world of children. While making multiliterate environments through this spatial design thinking process, teachers are empowered as designers and as makers of a 'third teacher,' where a wide-ranging diversity of people, texts, practices, meanings, and cultural contexts intersect to build communication.;"[Cortes Loyola, Catalina; Bravo Colomer, Ursula] Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Concepcion 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile; [Adlerstein Grimberg, Cynthia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile";;Loyola, CC (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Concepcion 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile.;"catalinacortes@udd.cl; cadlerst@uc.cl; ubravo@udd.cl";Adlerstein, Cynthia/AAV-8228-2020;Adlerstein, Cynthia/0000-0001-7174-0100;;;;130;1;1;4;22;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1871-1871;1878-0423;;THINK SKILLS CREAT;Think.

However, it is often difficult to keep parents involved, particularly when they lack the time or academic knowledge. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on achievement in mathematics among adolescent children when involving parents from low-income communities in the learning process. This involvement is achieved through activities that do not include any formal curricular content. A randomly selected group of parents was nudged, via text message (SMS), to complete short and simple weekly activities with their children. The teacher then connected these activities to the curricular content in class. The results reveal that, on average, the intervention increased the students' math grade point average (GPA) by 0.488 standard deviations (p < .05) more than students whose parents only received administrative text messages. This effect remains over time, extending into the following school year.

Employing a phenomenographic approach, 34 final-year students of a Bachelor in Biological Sciences and a Bachelor of Medicine, from one research-oriented Chilean university, were interviewed. Four categories of description emerged from interviews analysis. These categories range from experiencing teaching and research as disconnected activities to experiencing the relationship between teaching and research as a space to develop higher order thinking skills. Additionally, three dimensions of variation presented a more detailed picture of their experience: role of students in the research process, teaching focus and learning spaces where research is experienced. Also, when comparing the students' experiences, we found that medicine students, unlike those of biology, do not experience teaching and research as disconnected activities (category A). Besides, although both biology and medicine students experience the relationship between teaching and research as a space to develop thinking skills (category D), there is a difference between them regarding the type of skills that they can develop: analysis and problem-solving in biology and the ability to make informed decisions and raise scientific questions in medicine. These results provide useful insights on how students experience teaching and research activities and its relationship. This might prove useful to the university community to improve the way in which teaching and research are linked in the curriculum of undergraduate programmes, particularly in the biological sciences.;"[Olivares-Donoso, Ruby; Gonzalez, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Olivares-Donoso, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;rrolivares@uc.cl;"Olivares-Donoso, Ruby/G-8472-2017; González, Carlos/D-7228-2017";"Olivares-Donoso, Ruby/0000-0001-7781-7076; González, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777";National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CONICYT-FONDECYT Regular 1130982, CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2013-21130423];The authors declare they have received the following funding for supporting the work presented in this paper: grant CONICYT-FONDECYT Regular 1130982 and the first author is a CONICYT Ph.D. grantee (CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2013-21130423).

We called the first type restricted improvement because at its center is the management of processes that mainly target academic achievement tests; the second is incipient improvement, which is based on changes that restructure the school processes; the third identified trajectory are cases where school improvement is moving toward institutionalization, while the last are those cases where improvement has been already institutionalized and the schools have achieved high levels of educational effectiveness.

J;"Foxley, VG; Cabrol, GO";;;;"Gubbins Foxley, Veronica; Otero Cabrol, Gabriel";;;Effects of Chilean schools' accountability on parent participation;REVISTA DE EDUCACION;;;Spanish;Article;;;;;;"School Effectiveness; accountability; parent participation";INVOLVEMENT;The educational reforms implemented in Latin America have encouraged parental participation in order to regulate school effectiveness. The assumption is that the model will work as long as schools provide families with public, pertinent, and timely information. When the right to choose freely cannot be exercised, school effectiveness can be regulated through parental participation in school activities. The main objective of this study was to estimate the effects of household socioeconomic status and type of information provided by the school on parent participation in school. A cross-sectional, quantitative, non-experimental study of the relationship between information and participation of parents with household socioeconomic status was conducted from a least squares regression analysis (OLS) and binary logistic regression models. The study is based on data from a subsample of 258 people who reported at least one child studying high school education. We used data from the Metropolitan Family and Education Survey developed by the Centro de Estudio e Investigacion sobre Familia (CEIF). The results show that parents are more willing to participate in activities related to the everyday aspects of their children's school experience. OLS models reveal some elements that positively influence parental participation: accountability (.24), personal student information (.42), and high socioeconomic status (2.49). Our conclusion is that the provision of personal student information, along with the accountability of institutional management, can increase the relative probability of a more active participation of families in functional classroom activities.;"[Gubbins Foxley, Veronica] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Calle Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile; [Otero Cabrol, Gabriel] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile";;Foxley, VG (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Calle Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile.;vgubbins@uahurtado.cl;;;;;;31;6;8;2;20;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

We surveyed 1951 students from 21 high schools of different levels of certification, socioeconomic groups and types. We used a quantitative method based on questionnaires that contained questions on environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour. The questions were related to garbage recycling, paper recycling, scarcity of water, use of electricity, used battery disposal and use of detergents. Environmental knowledge did not affect students' pro-environmental behaviour (R-2 = 0.06; p < 0.0001). On the other hand, school socioeconomic group and type did affect students' environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour (ANOVA, p > 0.05).

This analysis emerges from a considerate reflection on the teachings, and personal and professional milestones highlighted in the biogram. Both personally and professionally, a multiplicity of elements is observed in the life history of Maria Eliana, influencing the development of her leadership identity, particularly highlighting her self-recognition as a woman. This identity is oriented towards social justice, based on socio-emotional tools such as care, empathy, and participation; and understands and values the role these elements must take in Chilean education.

They are used to design professor training programs, evaluate teaching performance, and show evidence of performance to different stakeholders. SET surveys typically include an open-ended question which is not always considered in the analysis of the results. This study aims to show the contribution of analyzing the students' comments by means of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation methodology to factor them into the analysis of the quantitative part of the survey. For this purpose, a sample of 737 courses taught during 2017 and 2018 in an undergraduate program at a Chilean university is used. The results show that both the number of comments and the topics that can be extracted from them contribute significantly to the analysis of the professors' teaching performance. The topics extracted are more specific than the quantitative dimensions of the survey, which allows obtaining very concrete feedback for professors and for designing training programs. Around half of the topics extracted are actionable and do not depend on the intrinsic characteristics of the professors, which allows for effective improvements in teaching. Additionally, the extracted topics can be grouped into dimensions that have a correspondence with the quantitative dimensions of the survey, although they only cover a subset of the latter. This result provides insights to improve the survey design and adjust the weighting of its different dimensions.;[Marshall, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile;;Marshall, P (corresponding author), Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;pmarshall@uc.cl;;;;;;43;0;0;3;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0729-4360;1469-8366;;HIGH EDUC RES DEV;High.

The online component adapts to teachers' time constraints, requires fewer trained professionals for its implementation, and enhances participants' opportunities to engage in the exploration and visualization of mathematical concepts and ideas. Also, the face-to-face component of this instruction modality allows spontaneous communication and collaborative construction of knowledge in real settings. This paper describes the instructional model of Suma y Sigue, a b-learning professional development program for primary and middle school teachers, which has been designed and implemented in Chile since 2015, aimed at developing mathematical knowledge for teaching. A particular feature of the program is its high-degree of self-directed autonomous online learning. We discuss how contextualized situations are articulated to create a learning environment in which teachers get involved in a progressive construction of multiple components of this knowledge. We also describe the implementation of the program, discussing the effects of scaling in teachers' experiences, and also how the information gathered upon implementation has led to changes in the training of instructors and in the program's instructional design.;"[Martinez, Salome; Guinez, Flavio; Zamora, Raul; Bustos, Sofia; Rodriguez, Becky] Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile";;Martinez, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile.;samartin@dim.uchile.cl;Martinez, Salome/F-4878-2013;;"Center for Mathematical Modeling [PIA AFB-170001]; Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018; UNESCO-Hamdan Award";Center for Mathematical Modeling, Grant PIA AFB-170001, Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018 and UNESCO-Hamdan Award.;;47;3;3;10;29;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

Two manners of doing this are reported: undergraduate research and research-based courses. Although there are studies reporting benefits of participating in these experiences, few synthesize their findings. In this article, we present a literature review aimed at synthesizing and comparing results of the impact of participating in these research experiences to establish which approach is most beneficial for students to develop as scientists. Twenty studies on student participation in undergraduate research and research-based courses were reviewed. Results show that both types of experiences have positive effects on students. These results have implications for both practice and research. Regarding practice, we propose ideas for designing and implementing experiences that combine both types of experiences.

These judgments and messages reflect an absence of inclusive values, such as equity and acceptance of diversity, among the members of the dominant society. The fact that prejudiced beliefs about indigenous peoples have been upheld and passed on has contributed to the development of negative psychosocial effects and a stigmatized identity in members of such peoples. This article, set in the context of schools, seeks to identify and analyze possible expressions of ethnic prejudice among teachers in educational institutions within contexts of high social vulnerability. The methodology used is qualitative and descriptive. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews are the techniques applied. The sample is made up of 52 Chilean secondary school teachers in the Araucania region of Chile. The sample is intentionally selected in a process is guided by the project's objectives. Data analysis employs the methodological and theoretical aspects of the Grounded Theory approach. The results show that teachers are ethnically prejudiced against indigenous students. There is a stereotyped system of beliefs widely shared by members of the teaching profession. The study reveals diverse manifestations of teachers' prejudices at the cognitive, affective and behavioural levels. Diverse prejudiced beliefs and feelings towards indigenous students are unveiled; these beliefs and feelings lead to the generation of discriminatory relational dynamics, which implicitly transmit messages of inferiority and devaluation in different forms to indigenous students. Teachers from schools in indigenous contexts are barely conscious of the prejudices with which they operate. Their practices are found to lie far from a social perspective based on acceptance of diversity in the classroom, regard for people as individuals and equity.";Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Region De La Ar, Chile;;Pena, SB (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Educ, Manuel Montt 56, Temuco, Region De La Ar, Chile.;sbecerra@uct.cl;;;;;;38;1;1;1;9;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

This reform is unprecedented, both for the size of the new intermediate-level services (Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica) and the escalation of their bureaucratic complexity, facing widespread organisational problems that cause high stress and labour suffering. We argue that improving emotional working conditions is necessary to accomplish pedagogical goals, but this dimension has received little attention. This article presents a follow-up study focused on school principals and professionals' emotional and occupational experiences that have worked in the initial two-and-half years of one of the first Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica created in the country. The qualitative analysis of interviews reveals how they make sense of organisational dilemmas while crafting solutions for facing structural shortcomings of new institutions. We understand their extraordinary commitment as 'philanthropic emotional work', driven by genuine care for children and the nation's future. However, in this effort, they also experience labour suffering and work overload, which may compromise their well-being and the long-term accomplishment of this reform's goals. These observations highlight the need for a reflexive improvement of this reform, recognising emotional work as a valuable resource but unsustainable without appropriate institutional support.;"[Sanfuentes, Matias] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Sanfuentes, Matias; Garreton, Matias] Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies COES, Santiago, Chile; [Garreton, Matias] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, DesignLab, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Diaz, Rocio] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montoya, Claudio] Univ Chile, Saberes Docentes Ctr, Santiago, Chile";;Sanfuentes, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.;msanfuentes@unegocios.cl;;;"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) - National Agency for Research and Development (ANID); ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) funded by National Agency for Research and Development (ANID).

An increasingly critical challenge is how to most effectively engage with student perspectives to more effectively understand the nature of their learning experiences. Traditionally, student ratings have been the primary means with which to understand the student voice. Although approaches to student ratings have fragmented in recent years with diversifying research interest in student satisfaction, experience and engagement, relatively limited attention has been given to the epistemological underpinnings of ratings-based surveys or toward emerging alternative approaches to engaging the student voice. This paper analyses the epistemic foundations of ratings-based methods in the context of other emerging strategies that attempt to engage with student voices more collaboratively. From this analysis, a map of the range of current and emerging approaches to the capturing of the student evaluative voice is proposed to identify their key characteristics in understanding and prospectively shaping practice. This analysis demonstrates that although alternative methods possess a clear potential to respond more effectively to the ever more complex pedagogical demands, their potential is limited by the hegemony of the 'surveyed voice' and the resource challenges of sustaining heightened student engagement.;[Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Darwin, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;sdarwin@uahurtado.cl;Darwin, Stephen/AAS-9549-2020;Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451;Chilean government under the FONDECYT program [1170314];This work was supported by the Chilean government under the FONDECYT program [grant number 1170314].;;73;2;2;1;7;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0729-4360;1469-8366;;HIGH EDUC RES DEV;High.

Two specific points are discussed in this paper. The first aims to identify how different types of knowledge emerge when an individual is faced with a modelling task. The second is regarding the use of auxiliary material as a means of metaphorising a situation.

To ensure quality in graduate programs, accreditation is compulsory. The current article presents a model to improve the process of self-regulation. The main objective was to design a Model of Quality Assurance for Postgraduate Programs in order to constitute a theoretical, mathematical, and informatics reference that would optimize the processes of self-regulation, self evaluation, and accreditation of master and doctorate programs from the Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, Chile. This descriptive research is based on a mixed methods approach. The proposal was intended through theoretical and empirical references related to the accreditation systems. The analysis process was conducted with key informants, and the informatics instrument was created and validated through expert judgment. After the analysis, the model was optimized considering the expert's suggestions. As a result of the optimization process, a matrix of eight dimensions was obtained and it is available online in order to be used by the heads of postgraduate programs. Finally, a model with four main stages was achieved in order to install a self-regulation and a self-evaluated culture that leads to accreditation as evidence of the quality of postgraduate programs.;"[Careaga Butter, Marcelo; Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela; Jimenez Perez, Laura; Sepulveda Valenzuela, Eileen] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Meyer Aguilera, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Butter, MC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.;;"Badilla, Maria/T-3880-2019; Quintana, Maria Graciela Badilla/AAB-1015-2019; Sepulveda-Valenzuela, Eileen/AAB-8103-2019";"Quintana, Maria Graciela Badilla/0000-0002-1317-9228; Sepulveda-Valenzuela, Eileen/0000-0002-7506-9243";"Unit of Educational Computing and Knowledge Management; Faculty of Education of Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion";This research is conducted with the support of the Postgraduate Direction and the Unit of Educational Computing and Knowledge Management, from the Faculty of Education of Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion.;;32;3;3;0;19;ATHABASCA UNIV PRESS;ATHABASCA;1 UNIVERSITY DR, ATHABASCA, AB T9S 3A3, CANADA;1492-3831;;;INT REV RES OPEN DIS;Int.

Based on this, it discusses the possibilities of digital media production as a strategy for the self-expression of children and adolescents, particularly immersed in unequal and ethnically diverse educational contexts. The specific case of two Mapuche girls reveals complex ways of organizing and positioning their voices, where ` girl power' and ` post-girl power' discourses are relevant, but not so their ethnicity. The results show that television, with its main audiovisual genres, styles and stereotypes, appears clearly on the teenagers' creations, while the absence of Mapuche signs along the creation process and also into the digital stories seems to be related with two important features of the Chilean educational system: ethnic inequalities and its fierce attachment to neoliberalism.;[Valdivia, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile;;Valdivia, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile.;andrea.valdivia@u.uchile.cl;Valdivia, Andrea/K-1123-2016;;;;;31;5;5;0;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1743-9884;1743-9892;;LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL;Learn.

I argue that a stable policy environment, where change is only marginal or incremental, begets research problems and questions squarely situated within the boundaries of the established rules of the game. Conversely, whenever policy swerves considerably off its expected path, knowledge may not be available to illuminate policy-making. The motif of disassociation between the policy field in the making with the availability of knowledge to support it is probed via the analysis of two policy proposals currently in Chile's new government agenda: introducing tuition-free higher education and assuming greater state oversight of teacher education programs.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 4860, Chile;;Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.;abernasconi@uc.cl;Bernasconi, Andrés/I-9041-2012;Bernasconi, Andrés/0000-0001-8008-3747;;;;28;4;7;0;26;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

There is substantial research literature emphasizing the positive impact of early literacy learning on school achievement, mainly in the case of children at-risk, but there aren't adequate conditions at school to develop them. Here we examine the effects of teaching reading and writing strategies on at-risk children's literacy learning (mean 5 years 3 months). Material and method: 339 at-risk Chilean children (132 in the intervention group and 207 in the comparison group) were assessed, at the beginning and the end of the school year. Teachers participated in a 1-year professional development intervention that included training and expert coaching. Results: Positive intervention effects were observed on children's knowledge of the alphabet, emergent writing and word identification. There was no effect on children's oral language outcomes.

From a learning situation, consisting of deciding between two random games with dices, the relationship between proportional thinking and probabilistic thinking is studied, considering three states for proportional thinking and three types of probabilistic thinking. Under the focus of an instrumental case study, the decisions and arguments of Chilean high school students are analyzed. The results indicate that there are both beneficial and harmful relationships between proportional and probabilistic thinking, and that the difficulties in determining probabilities are not necessarily due to the absence of the use of proportions.

To address this problem, researchers have developed models to structure the process. However, we maintain that it is first necessary to understand how students actually search for information online when solving an information problem and compare their behaviours with the available literature. To do this, we collected and analysed the data on a laboratory setting of 41 students while they solved 16 information problems using the internet and expressed aloud what they were thinking whilst solving them. We identified 21 categories of actions, grouped into 9 activity types associated with four information search processes, showing that some of the students' stereotyped search behaviours are in fact conscious decisions based on the requirements of the task and the answers found. The results also show that searching for information on the internet can not only vary depending on the task's requirements, but also on the number of iterations students need to perform to reach an answer. These findings provide some evidence that challenge the assumption that students simply lack the competencies to search for information on the internet; rather, it seems that they show an awareness of different strategies, which they decide to use based on the context and purpose of the task, making their search behaviour more elaborated and complex than is usually portrayed by researchers in the field. Based on this, implications and further research lines are also discussed.";"[Hinostroza, J.

Literature suggests that inclusion takes place when barriers are removed, allowing participation. However, scholars agree that teachers still struggle with pedagogical practices in inclusive classrooms. Hansen (Hansen, J.H.2012. Limits to Inclusion. International Journal of Inclusive Education 16 (1): 89-98) contends that teachers establish limits to inclusion in order to manage the level of diversity, arguing that the limits depend on the teacher's understanding of disability. This article examines German secondary school teachers, who reflect on inclusive pedagogical practices and their relationship to learners with disabilities. The analysis shows that most teachers add levels of complexity when constructing the disability's identity. Teachers struggled with the notion of limitation associated with disability and with the discovery of the other, with new learning skills and abilities. Interactions with learners with a disability open new venues to practice inclusion and encourage participation, but this requires a change in practices; yet, not all teachers feel prepared to do that. Teachers offered various rationales on why they applied limits to inclusion; those rationales are rooted in how they interpret disability and their own roles as teachers.";"[Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile; [Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile";;"Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile.; Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile.";johanna.sagner@ufrontera.cl;;;;;;38;1;1;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

The hypothesis that we advance is that learning styles determine the mode in which users browse through websites. The post-observational notes and the analysis of logs (register of users' activity) indicate two main facts: on the one hand, the elaboration of a tool that is able to convert log files into graphs that could be visualized as courses of educational browsing. On the other hand, the confirmation of the relation between ways of learning and styles of browsing, giving rise to a method that anticipates choices made by users on the digital platform. There has been stated that assimilative and convergent learning students solve the assigned task consulting, preferably, the content modules on communicative interaction. For their part, accommodating learning students follow precise instructions and rely on his peers' activity. Finally, divergent learning students tend to prefer collaborative activities and they also help each other.

One of its importances relies on the fact that it affects in a direct way the learning potential. It has been shown that, even thou cognitive processes develop side by side with biological maturity, this cognitive development can be enhanced by means of mediated learning as signaled by Feuerstein's Mediated Learning theory. Based on this theory is that we propose an intervention model that addresses school academic issues using technologically assisted small group collaboration, pursuing a dual academic objective: to thrive students' cognitive processes while addressing school curriculum topics. The purpose, therefore, is to balance the students' cognitive differences by means of in-school content-filled classroom activities. Our aim is to make use of peer mediation in a real world setting with a virtual construction of it. In this paper, we describe this novel intervention model along with an in-school usage experience. For this, we present an activity designed for high school students, specifically aimed to assist the learning of kinematics, graph interpretation, and graph plotting. In this activity the students work in groups of three, using a robot and wirelessly interconnected Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). By means of a controlled experiment, we show how technologically-supported peer mediation promotes the students' enrichment of their cognitive processes in each of the different stages of the mental act (input-elaboration-output), favoring communication skills, insight, and reasoning, while also restraining impulsive conduct and trial-and-error answers.;"[Mitnik, Ruben; Nussbaum, Miguel; Recabarren, Matias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 22, Chile";;Mitnik, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, POB 306, Santiago 22, Chile.;"rmitnik@ing.puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; mrecabarren@ing.puc.cl";"Recabarren, Matias/AAZ-5945-2021; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983;;;;20;16;16;0;20;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1436-4522;;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven's (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177-211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator's process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices.

However, learning analytics is part of a young community and its developments deserve further exploration. Some critical stances claim that learning analytics tends to underplay the complexity of teaching-learning processes. By means of both a bibliometric and a content analysis, this paper examines the publication patterns on learning analytics in higher education and their main challenges. 385 papers that were published in WoScc and SciELO indexes between 2013 and 2019 were identified and analysed. Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students' learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community. Within both communities, though, it seems that the focus is more on analytics than on learning.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Gomez-Gonzalez, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile; [Rojas-Murphy Tagle, Andres] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lorca-Vyhmeister, Alejandro] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;"Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Rojas-Murphy Tagle, Andres Felipe/0000-0001-5853-9939";"FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1200633, 1161413]; ANID-Chile";This work was supported by ANID-Chile, Fondecyt projects 1200633 and 1161413.;;61;6;6;9;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;2365-9440;;;INT J EDUC TECHNOL H;Int.

However, participation in ECE programs is not equally distributed across social groups. It has been observed in different international contexts that there are factors such as availability, accessibility and affordability that hinder access for disadvantaged families. Chile has promoted policies to reduce these factors: greater availability of centers, priority selection in admission and free tuition. Through 56 semi-structured interviews from 7 centers, non-participant observations for six months in one of the centers and one year of fieldwork, we sought to understand access to ECE. The results show that, despite priority access policies, there are decisions on availability, implementation of accessibility and funding-oriented affordability practices that hinder access. This work provides new evidence and discusses the implications of the results for equitable access to ECE for disadvantaged families.;"[Barco, Blanca; Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Barco, B (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;bsbarco@uc.cl;Barco, Blanca/H-8179-2017;Barco, Blanca/0000-0003-1461-1462;"ANID [PIA CJE 160007]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional [2014-21140206]; Faculty of Education Doctoral Program, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile";"Both authors are grateful for support from ANID PIA CJE 160007; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2014-21140206 and Faculty of Education Doctoral Program, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile;";;56;0;0;1;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0957-5146;1472-4421;;EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON;Early Years;OCT 19;2020;40;4-5;;;;;400;415;;10.1080/09575146.2020.1742097;;APR 2020;16;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;PH5MJ;WOS:000523314400001;;;;;2022-04-06;

Relying on a mixed-method design, we gathered data from individual and group interviews and an online survey conducted with 268 ECEC teachers. Drawn from both a priori and emergent categories, our findings reveal that participants held four paradoxical views on the new System: salary justice versus monetizing of the profession; professional teaching recognition versus counter-pedagogical identity, rigorous evaluation versus inappropiate evaluation instruments, and palpable individual career advancement versus doubtful field development. These paradoxes show that ECEC teachers have a positive global view of the new STPD, despite their perception of its individualistic and counter-ECEC pedagogical nature, suggesting a claim for their right to professional development and decent working conditions, as well as a criticism of the STPD's neoliberal foundation.";"[Pardo, Marcela] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Adlerstein, Cynthia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Pardo, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile.;marcelapardo@ciae.uchile.cl;Adlerstein, Cynthia/AAV-8228-2020;Adlerstein, Cynthia/0000-0001-7174-0100;"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761]];  [FB0003]";"This work was supported by the MINEDUC & UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761];ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003].";;42;1;2;2;11;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0957-5146;1472-4421;;EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON;Early Years;OCT 19;2020;40;4-5;;;;;387;399;;10.1080/09575146.2020.1736008;;MAR 2020;13;Education & Educational Research;Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);Education & Educational Research;PH5MJ;WOS:000518312700001;;;;;2022-04-06;

In the current article we examine emotional meaning making among 12 novice principals engaged with practical tasks involved in school leadership and management. Data were produced through in-depth interviews conducted at the beginning and at the end of their first year in the position. Findings show that negative emotions predominated and that these were mainly elicited in situations involving conflicts with staff.

Using the case of Chile, this paper examines the ways in which accountability policies are reworked within schools and how they affect actors' subjectivities. It adds new findings to the existing body of research on school accountability policies, offering in-depth evidence based on the case of Chile, which has a high-stakes testing model and a widespread competitive voucher system. The research is based on case studies of ten public and private subsidised schools, framed by a sociological perspective of policy enactment theory. The research findings show the ways that accountability policies are recreated, expanded, and intensified at the local level, permeating an ethic of competition. The analysis focuses on three qualitative trends: school actors' sense-making of test scores and labels; zones of safety and risk for teachers under an accountability regime; and the emergence of a sticky web of persuasion, surveillance, and coercion among school members in order to improve performance. The practices examined are not understood as 'secondary effects' or an 'implementation problem', as if they occur unconnected from the policy rationale.

The questions guiding the study were to what extent school staff share similar perspectives toward victimisation (as demonstrative of a school culture), and how this impacts the capacity to generate positive school climates in multi-ethnic elementary urban schools in Santiago. Drawing on theories of school culture, I propose that staff members' abilities and willingness to identify and implement preventive measures in schools are collectively defined and legitimated. I demonstrate that this has important repercussions in contexts of higher-than-average ethnic compositions where assimilation is encouraged, and victimisation is denied or attributed to other causes. Symbolic and superficial celebrations of multiculturalism are common, but cultural discourses of difference maintain ethnic youth in marginalised positions and prevent more inclusive educational practices. Some staff perspectives adhere to colour-blind liberal forms of racism in these contexts, and these are most common in school cultures where victimisation is downplayed or thought to be an issue cultivated in the home. Recommendations are made to incorporate culturally-sensitive pedagogies and cultural mediators to confront these narratives among school climate committees.;[Webb, Andrew] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vikuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile;;Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vikuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.;Andrew.webb@uc.cl;;Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670;"Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [FONDAP 15110006]; Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism grant Millenium Nucleus for the Study of the Life Course and Vulnerability; Conicyt/Fondecyt RegularComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1190604]";This work was supported by Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [grant number FONDAP 15110006], and the Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism grant Millenium Nucleus for the Study of the Life Course and Vulnerability.

Considering variable trends in mining, academic institutions with geology programs in Chile were analyzed to provide an evaluation of their current state and projected development across the country. Through the compilation of 5 years of data, a comparison was undertaken in relation to the age of the programs, their respective lifespans, geographic distributions, vacancies, annual entry fees, yearly tuitions, scores on admission tests, curricula, and human resources and infrastructure. The main results indicate the following: most of the new programs are located in or near the Metropolitan Region due to population trends rather than the locations of mines, the actual number of new students may double the total amount of vacancies, the student program fee tends to increase with time and varies between the programs with no apparent relationship to quality, there exists a strong variation in scores needed to enter into the geology programs, and currently there are more individuals studying geology than total graduates. When considering the unfavorable projections for mining in Chile, it is conclusive that this career will not yield the anticipated benefits for graduates unless new, more diverse professional opportunities develop in other sectors.;"[Tapia, J.; Tolorza, V.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Duran, P.] Univ Antofagasta, Dept Ingn Minas, Fac Ingn, Antofagasta, Chile; [Poblete, N.] PGS SPA, Huerfanos 1055,Of 503, Santiago, Chile";;Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.;joseline.tapia@uach.cl;Tapia, Joseline/AAH-4000-2019;"Tapia, Joseline/0000-0002-1516-2622; Tolorza, Violeta/0000-0002-0281-4476";"CONICYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [79150070]; FONDECYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160843]";"This work would not be possible without the valuable help of the Group of Education in Geology of the Geological Society of Chile.

Counter stories describe how teachers use their professional experience to confront those mega narratives composed of dominant educational policies that impinge upon their pedagogical practices. The mega narrative described in this study as a citizenship education mega policy narrative is composed by citizenship educational guidelines that have become influenced by other market-driven educational policies, and is not only present in Chile but has also been influenced by policies coming from countries such as England and the US. Therefore, the discussions that emerge from these counter stories on the nature of this mega narrative and the ways through which teachers can confront it through their teaching, and the implications that all this has for the field of citizenship education, do not only fill a gap in Chilean research but also contribute to discussions on counter and mega narratives in the field of citizenship education within a wider international scope.;[Cavieres-Fernandez, Eduardo] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Vina Del Mar, Chile;;Cavieres-Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;ecavieres-cea@upla.cl;;Cavieres-Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0003-3199-5090;FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121156];This work was supported by FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico) [grant number 11121156].;;85;2;4;1;14;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0022-0272;1366-5839;;J CURRICULUM STUD;J.

One obstacle to acceptance arises from a culture of quantitative assessment (often represented by a single mark), which is at odds with the concept of outcome assessment which is by essence subjective, qualitative and multidimensional. The method presented here is specifically concerned with learning activities where students need to demonstrate competency in learning outcomes of different natures. It describes a methodological framework that can be used in any programme that aims at developing multidimensional learners, but operates in a context where the final assessment product is a single quantitative grade. This method follows a classical approach to the evaluation of each learning outcome. It then proposes an innovative way of ranking students by categorising their overall performance based on conditions that reflect the integral nature of the learning process, to allow teaching staff to assign a range of marks for each student. Finally, a last step allows a quantitative ranking of students within each category, yielding a single quantitative mark for the course while remaining coherent with the learning goals.;"[Serandour, Guillaume; Illanes, Alfredo; Maturana, Jorge] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile; [Cadiz, Janet] Univ Austral Chile, Dept Aseguramiento Calidad & Innovac Curricular, Valdivia, Chile";;Serandour, G (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile.;gserandour@uach.cl;Sérandour, Guillaume/AAM-1087-2020;;;;;31;0;0;1;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0260-2938;1469-297X;;ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU;Assess.

J;"Weinstein, J; Munoz, G";;;;"Weinstein, Jose; Munoz, Gonzalo";;;When duties are not enough: principal leadership and public or private school management in Chile;SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT;;;English;Article;;;;;;"principal leadership; school management; privatization";CHARTER;The Chilean education system is an emblematic case of school management privatization, with the majority of schools operating under government funding, but private administration. This article addresses the incidence of this dimension on school leadership, showing the differences and continuities established among primary school principals in the subsidized private and municipal sectors. The conclusion is that private school administrators do not recruit principals on a competitive basis, as a result of which these principals do not present a more developed professional profile, and that merely having more duties for executing the principal position - as happens in subsidized private schools - is not enough for an effective development of practices evidencing improved school leadership. These conclusions challenge the statement frequently expressed, but lacking sufficient empirical evidence, that the greater autonomy in school management encompassed by privatization will positively impact on school leadership and, therefore, on educational improvement.;"[Weinstein, Jose; Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Munoz, G (corresponding author), Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;gonzalo.munozs@mail.udp.cl;Muñoz, Gonzalo/ABG-3838-2020;Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841;;;;34;11;13;3;57;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

Following review of the available literature, we classify the causes of the lack of impact on students' attainment in four dimensions: (1) the design and implementation of ICT in educational settings; (2) the evaluation of its impact; (3) the scaling up of these kinds of innovations; and (4) the cost-effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning environments. Based on this evidence, we proposed the evolutionary development model (EDM), which aims to produce a cost-effective and sustainable ICT for education (ICT4E) programme in three steps: efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. In each step, one component of the programme is built and validated in real educational settings. Therefore, the resultant ICT4E programme is ready to be replicated across the school system. We also show how the EDM guided the development of a programme based on mobile computer supported collaborative learning, known as Eduinnova.

In four schools parents and teachers saw each other as trustworthy and collaborating to provide an education that could transform students' life chances. In the other six schools, social relations were marked by distrust, staff constructed students as lacking the resources necessary to benefit from a rigorous academic programme, and parents in leadership positions shared with teachers the belief that school failure could largely be attributed to uncommitted parents. These results suggest that the impact of quality assurance policies tends to be associated with the social capital of municipal schools, thus educational policy needs to consider developing and strengthening social capital within schools.;"[Montecinos, Carmen; Sisto, Vicente; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile.;Carmen.montecinos@ucv.cl;Sisto, Vicente/G-5455-2013;"Sisto, Vicente/0000-0003-4510-4041; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848";;;;45;10;14;0;19;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;0305-0068;;;COMP EDUC;Comp.

J;Espinoza, O;;;;Espinoza, Oscar;;;Solving the equity-equality conceptual dilemma: a new model for analysis of the educational process;EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH;;;English;Article;;;;;;"equity; equality; excellence; model; goal; critical theory";"OPPORTUNITY; EXCELLENCE; JUSTICE";"Background Over the past four decades there have been a number of controversies arising from the discussion of 'equity' and 'equality'. These concepts are often invoked by policy analysts, policy-makers, government officials and scholars in order to justify or critique resource allocation to different levels of the educational system. Purpose By creating a new equality-equity goal-oriented model, which allows the combination of different dimensions for each concept with different stages of the educational process, this paper aims to achieve two purposes: (1) to clarify among researchers, educators, evaluators, policy analysts, and policy-makers the notions of 'equality' and 'equity'; and (2) to encourage researchers and evaluators to critically examine and synthesize equality/equity-based research. Sources of evidence A review of the literature concerning the meaning, goals and assumptions of the concepts 'equity' and 'equality', and their implications for social and public policy, is presented. Main argument A survey of recent and earlier debates on 'equity' and 'equality' among scholars and researchers reveals disagreement and confusion about what those concepts really mean and what they involve in terms of goals and results. It is debatable whether we can have 'equity' and 'equality' in a society that prioritizes efficiency in resource management over social justice. Certainly, such questions have shaped and guided many discussions and theoretical debates among scholars, policy analysts and policy-makers. Conclusions Most of the definitions of 'equity' and 'equality' are frequently used by many researchers, evaluators, policy-makers, policy analysts, scholars and educators as if they were interchangeable. Instead of arguing for a unique or simple conception of 'equity' and 'equality', a set of definitions of those concepts as well as a discussion related to theoretical and policy issues associated are presented. In order to avoid that confusion, the equality-equity model developed in this paper suggests several new directions for analysis and research. It provides some ideas about how 'equity' (i.e. 'equity for equal needs', 'equity for equal potential' and 'equity for equal achievement') and 'equality' (i.e. 'equality of opportunity', 'equality for all' and 'equality on average across social groups') could be treated and measured in future research in relation to different features of the educational process (availability of resources, access, survival, output and outcome).";Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile;;Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Manuel Rodriguez Sur 415, Santiago, Chile.;pirata14@hotmail.com;;;;;;97;71;79;4;34;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0013-1881;1469-5847;;EDUC RES-UK;Educ.

The aim is to describe ongoing strategies and learn from practical experiences in this field. The cases analyzed reveal that school-level evaluations and collective incentives adapt better to the characteristics of the educational process and the potential for teamwork, while individual evaluations pose some difficulties. Several evaluation systems currently in use emphasize educational inputs and, in some cases, mainly compliance with rules and procedures, irrespective of education results (output). If the factors considered in assessing school performance do not correlate well with educational achievement, the incentives vanish. Hence, the importance of emphasizing output and ensuring that if measures are included for inputs and processes, these must line up with educational achievement.

Self-efficacy is a key component in the acquisition of procedural skills. Therefore, professionals' self-efficacy in arterial puncture should be measured before attempting the procedure on real patients. Objective: To develop and psychometrically assess a self-efficacy scale in arterial puncture. Design: An observational cross-sectional design was used in this study. Setting: Faculty of Education Sciences, Nursing and Physiotherapy in a higher education institution in the south of Spain. Participants: A convenience sample of 342 nursing students entered and completed the study. All participants met the following inclusion criteria: (1) >= 18 years old and (2) enrolled in a nursing degree programme during the 2014/2015 academic year. Participants were 74% female (n = 254) and their age ranged from 18 to 50, with a mean age of 21.74 years (SD = 5.14). Method: The Arterial Puncture Self-Efficacy Scale (APSES) was developed and psychometrically tested. Reliability and content validity were studied. Predictive validity and concurrent validity assessed criterion validity. In addition, principal component analysis and known-group analysis evaluated construct validity. Results: Principal component analysis revealed the two-subscale structure of the final 22-item version of the Arterial Puncture Self-Efficacy Scale (APSES). A total Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97 showed its high reliability. The APSES' content validity index was excellent (S-CVI/Ave = 0.95). Predictive and concurrent validity analysis demonstrated the good criterion validity of the tool. Supporting the APSES' sensitivity and specificity, known-groups analysis evidenced significant differences (p < 0.001) in self-efficacy levels between groups. Conclusion: The APSES showed good psychometric properties for measuring self-efficacy in arterial puncture for ABG analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, educational institutions had to move abruptly from in-person to online classes, having to be flexible and innovative, one of the main concerns being the semester-end examinations in practical modules. Objective: This study aimed to explore nursing students' perceptions of the use of a serious game-like model in their final online objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Design: An exploratory phenomenological study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during June 2020. Settings: This study took place at the University of Almeria with nursing students enrolled in a clinical placement module. Participants: Eighty-nine fourth-year nursing students took part in this study. Methods: Following the educational principles of the OSCE, a virtual OSCE was designed, using the Genially platform, an online platform for creating interactive content, to set up an assessment as a story-telling game-like model. A total of 5 focus groups (FGs) were conducted afterwards via the GoogleMeet platform. In addition, 30 semi-structured interviews were performed via the same platform. The data was analysed using a content analysis approach and supported by the ATLAS.ti 8.4 software. Results: Our finding revealed 2 main themes and 4 sub-themes. The two main themes were (i) generating emotions and feelings in times of virtuality; including emotions and feelings experienced by students during their online assessment process, and (ii) online assessment: a potential alternative to educational barriers; describing the variability of traditional modality, its implications for learning and the acquisition of competences. Conclusions: Serious game-like models, such as the story-telling game proposed, as part of their online OSCE assessment appear to be an appropriate alternative assessment method for face-to-face approaches. This paper adds new evidence on the use of innovative and state-of-art resources as part of nursing OSCE assessments in a new reality for most students and teachers. Serious game-like models in online OSCE may empower students and help them to remove perceived barriers in face-to-face assessments.";"[Roman, Pablo; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Cristofer; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing Sci Physiotherapy & Med, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Roman, Pablo; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Res Grp CTS 451 Hlth Sci, Almeria, Spain; [Roman, Pablo; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Hlth Res Ctr, Almeria, Spain; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Cristofer] Torrecardenas Univ Hosp, Almeria 04009, Spain; [Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel] Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Predept Nursing, Av Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel] Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Grp CYS, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Hlth Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, Adult Child & Midwifery Dept, London, England";;Rodriguez-Arrastia, M (corresponding author), Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Predept Nursing, Av Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;"pablo.roman@ual.es; arrastia@uji.es; jgranero@ual.es; cfernan@ual.es; j.hernandez-padilla@ual.es";Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/R-2920-2018;Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/0000-0001-9430-4272;;;;34;0;0;6;6;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;0260-6917;1532-2793;;NURS EDUC TODAY;Nurse Educ.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.;"[Marques, Maira; Ochoa, Sergio F.; Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia; Gutierrez, Francisco J.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile";;Marques, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile.;"mmarques@dcc.uchile.cl; sochoa@dcc.uchile.cl; cecilia@dcc.uchile.cl; frgutier@dcc.uchile.cl";SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/Q-8247-2019;SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/0000-0001-5347-1664;"Project Fondef IDeAComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [IT13I20010]; Conicyt Chile (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional) [2012-21120544]";This work was supported by the Project Fondef IDeA under Grant IT13I20010.

Implementing these activities requires course redesign, which must be meticulous for their full potential to be reached. This can require a lot of work for first time users, which can be a barrier to implementation. Educational design patterns alleviate this burden by facilitating new course design with practices demonstrated to promote student engagement. This paper reports on the redesign of an introductory programming course and its experimental evaluation. The redesign was based on the community of inquiry learning framework (CoL), using design patterns from online Web communities and team-based learning (TBL). The evaluation included 562 students, 117 of them randomly assigned to two different experimental groups. One group used a CoL approach, and the other a blended TBL and CoL methodology. The remaining students were assigned to control groups. Results showed that students in the experimental groups outperformed those in the control group by the end of the semester, while the experimental CoL and TBL methodology helped students achieve a higher level of understanding in a shorter period of time due to increased participation rates. These data provide empirical evidence of the learning gains offered by online learning communities, and the way in which educational design patterns can facilitate course redesign.;"[Cabrera, Ignacio] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Sci & Engn, Penalolen 7941169, Chile; [Villalon, Jorge] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago 8790922, Chile; [Chavez, Jorge] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago 7510287, Chile";;Villalon, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago 8790922, Chile.;jorge.villalon@udp.cl;;"Chavez, jorge/0000-0001-7603-4766; Villalon, Jorge/0000-0003-3021-3827";Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 11130055];This work was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYT under Grant FONDECYT 11130055.;;46;19;19;4;28;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course.;"[LeBoeuf, Richard L.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez, Jorge T.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Gomez, JT (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;jtgomez1@uc.cl;;LeBoeuf, Richard/0000-0002-0427-6069;;;;41;8;8;3;11;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0020-7209;2050-4578;;INT J ELEC ENG EDUC;Int.

Thus, outreach is becoming increasingly important, and activities with schoolchildren are being extensively carried out as part of this effort. In this context, robotics is a very attractive and effective tool for fostering interest in science and technology among children and young people and for attracting them toward engineering. In this article, experience with different robotics-centered outreach activities in the Universidad de Chile (UCH), Santiago, Chile, will be shared. These activities include robotics courses for children, social robots as keynote speakers, mechatronics design courses, and participation in international robotics competitions, which contribute synergistically to the goal of attracting students to UCH's Electrical Engineering (EE) Department. Owing to its novelty, the use of social robots as keynote speakers for schoolchildren will be described in detail. Experimental results that demonstrate how sophisticated social robots can be used to foster the interest of young people in technology will be shown. Altogether, more than 3000 schoolchildren have participated directly in these outreach activities here in Chile, creating a sizeable impact in this country.;"[Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 8370451, Chile; [Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier] Univ Chile, Adv Min Technol Ctr, Santiago 8370451, Chile";;Ruiz-del-Solar, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 8370451, Chile.;jruizd@ing.uchile.cl;Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier/H-5214-2013;Ruiz-del-Solar, Javier/0000-0003-2965-633X;"Chilean Government; Millennium Nucleus Center for Web Research, Chile [P04-067-F]";This work was supported by the Chilean Government under the Explora-CONICYT Program and by the Millennium Nucleus Center for Web Research, Chile, under Grant P04-067-F.;;16;24;24;1;12;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

Equated scores are obtained estimating the equating transformation function, which maps the scores on the scale of one test form into their equivalents on the scale of other one. All the statistical models that have been proposed for estimating this function are based on continuous approximations of the score distributions, leading to equated scores lying on a continuous scale even though score scales are usually subsets of the integer numbers (e.g., the total number of correct answers). In this article, we develop a new equating method from which equated scores defined on the original discrete scale are obtained. Considering scores as ordinal random variables, we propose a continuous latent variable formulation to perform an equipercentile-like equating based on a Bayesian nonparametric model for score distributions. The proposed model is applied to simulated and real data collected under an equivalent group design. Some methods to assess the performance of our model are also discussed. Compared with discrete versions of equated scored obtained from traditional equating methods, the results show that the proposed method has better performance.;"[Varas, Ines M.; Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LIES, Santiago, Chile; [Quintana, Fernando A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile";;Varas, IM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LIES, Santiago, Chile.;"imvaras@mat.uc.cl; jorge.gonzalez@mat.uc.cl; quintana@mat.puc.cl";;"Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795; Varas Caceres, Ines Maria/0000-0002-1628-1797";"CONICYT Doctorado Nacional grant [21151486]; Swedish MMW grant [2019.0129]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180034]; Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism, grant Millenium Nucleus Center for the Discovery of Structures in Complex Data";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: In ' es M.

The STEM fields are particularly critical in the development of these modern, more just societies. In the United States, the social and racial justice debates are ever more relevant and present in academia. Studies focused on under-represented and under-served groups in education, especially STEM fields, are timely and of paramount importance. This is a study that analyzed student data of 19 institutions, concentrated in what is known as the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD). It utilized multilevel (HLM) analysis focused on the Time to Graduate outcome of under-represented populations, emphasizing the Latino/Hispanics group. Multilevel analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate differences in groups such as institutions and races/ethnicities, which is the type of data MIDFIELD affords. Results show that depending on the multilevel model, either fixed or random slope, there is a significant difference between the number of terms taken to graduate for under-represented groups, including Latinos/ Hispanics, compared to White groups and for Black compared to White groups. This suggests that Black students tend to be more impacted by their institution than other racial/ethnical groups. Since the emphasis was Latinos/Hispanics, the question remaining is if these results transfer to a sample with more Latino/Hispanic representation.;"[Diaz, Noemi V.

This study sought to understand the strengths and weaknesses of using TBL in a specific subject (anatomy), discipline (veterinary medicine), and country (Chile). Students in the course had not been previously exposed to TBL. At the end of the semester during which TBL was used, the research team collected student satisfaction survey data and conducted a focus group in order to understand students' experiences with TBL in the course. We found that overall, students were satisfied with TBL and appreciated that it increased the amount of feedback they received, reinforced key concepts, and helped them to build skills they would need in their future professions.There was also a certain level of dissatisfaction, which may have been caused by negative experiences with team members and difficulties reading the preparatory material, which was in English. Given our findings, we discuss modifications that could be made in order to improve veterinary medicine students' experiences with TBL.;"[Diamond, Kate K.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Higher Educ, Dept Org Leadership Policy & Dev, 178 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vasquez, Cecilia] 3450 Wayne Ave,Apt 24S, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Borroni, Cintya; Paredes, Rodolfo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Escuela Med Vet, Republ 440, Santiago, Chile";;Diamond, KK (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Higher Educ, Dept Org Leadership Policy & Dev, 178 Pillsbury Dr SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;"Koehl220@umn.edu; ceciliavasquezcarrillo@gmail.com; cintya.borroni@unab.cl; rparedes@unab.cl";;paredes, rodolfo/0000-0002-5909-9362;;;;27;1;1;1;3;UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC;TORONTO;JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA;0748-321X;1943-7218;;J VET MED EDUC;J.

These examples are easier to understand and display a richer behavior than the ones commonly used from mechanics, electronics, hydrodynamics, lasers, chemical reactions, and population dynamics. In particular, an electric motor driven by a dynamo can display stationary, Hopf, and codimension-two bifurcations by tuning the driving speed of the dynamo and the electric current in the stator of the electric motor. When the dynamo is driven at constant torque instead of constant rotation rate, chaotic reversals of the generated current and of the angular rotation of the motor are observed. Simple deterministic models are presented which capture the observed dynamical regimes.

While structural and organisational aspects of teaching are frequently assessed, programme evaluation tools are rarely matched to specific learning objectives and competence levels that students are expected to achieve. Driven by the shortcomings of previous unstructured surveys on the quality of teaching at our Faculty, we created a curriculum improvement framework based on the evaluation tool that compares the level of competence that students perceive they achieved in each of the courses, and the level of competence that professors attribute to their courses by quantifying the learning outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy. In our two year study, which included seven teachers who teach 16 courses and 38 and 24 students in two consecutive years, this framework provided the educators with the indicators for quality enhancement based on the difference between students' and teachers' evaluations. Based on indicator values, the teacher implemented improvements on two pilot courses. In the second round of surveys, we were able to measure the success of improvements. Our findings indicate that the proposed framework and evaluation tool are simple to implement and can be used as indicators and starting points for improving the quality of teaching. In this way, we provide a practical framework for others wishing to enhance their teaching and their students' learning.;"[Stojadinovic, Zoran; Nadazdi, Ana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Civil Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia; [Bozic, Marija] Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile";;Stojadinovic, Z (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Civil Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia.;"joka@grf.bg.ac.rs; marija.bozic@e-campus.uab.cat; anikolic.grf@gmail.com";Stojadinovic, Zoran/AAU-2915-2021;Stojadinovic, Zoran/0000-0002-9535-9977;;;;21;1;1;0;0;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

It provides opportunities for change in both the curriculum of the programme and the pedagogy of delivery. However, the starting point is with staff to acquire educational knowledge applicable to engineering education. It is argued that accreditation could indeed be an opportunity for a change with positive consequences for the institution, faculty, department, curriculum, academic staff, students and industry, and discusses the challenges during the accreditation process. The objective of this paper is to review the paradigm shift from teaching to learning and how adjustment of a curriculum to a particular accreditation criterion affects the stakeholders. It is acknowledged that accreditation may provide benefits in educational and organizational quality improvements as it encourages awareness of the best practices, increases public confidence and ensures institutional accountability. However, it also entails some inherent challenges such as additional costs, increased staff workload, uncertainty regarding its effectiveness and possibly organizational concerns. Accreditation creates opportunities for change; including the fundamental adjustment in the curriculum of the programme. However, a key element is staff trained to apply educational knowledge and principles for engineering education, which is usually deficient in faculty members. A successful shift in the educational paradigm needs an understanding of the rationale for the outcomes-based educational approach and philosophy as well as the concept of attributes and non-conventional pedagogy.";"[Uziak, Jacek] Univ Botswana, Dept Mech Engn, P Bag UB0061, Gaborone, Botswana; [Oladiran, M.

In particular, we focus the work on the realization of phase-only gratings and phase-only spiral phases for the generation of vortex beams, beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). Despite the extensive activity in this field, its experimental implementation for educational purposes is limited because it requires the use of very expensive high-resolution liquid-crystal on silicon (LCOS) SLMs. Here, we show that a low-cost experimental implementation can be done with older TNLC technology. However, these devices, intended for display applications, exhibit rather limited optical phase modulation properties in comparison with modern LCOS devices, such as a very low range of phase modulation and a general coupled intensity modulation.

Using the properties of the rotation matrix and associated operators, we show that it is possible to find an exact analytical solution to a number of problems where the differential equation of motion depends on the velocity. First, we apply our method to the well-known cases of a particle under the influence of the Lorentz force and Coriolis force, providing the complete analytical solution in each case for the motion of the particle in three dimensions. We also show that the complete solution can be obtained when the centrifugal force is included, showing the applicability to cases where there is simultaneous dependence on the position and velocity. This method, which is not currently discussed in a typical course in elementary mechanics, provides an alternative approach to the traditional methods that are used to solve these types of problems.

Although the mainstream core of engineering design trains students to face teamwork from a co-located standpoint, existing studies point out the benefits and tradeoffs of distributed team training. This article explores the complexities of working in distributed teams by assessing distributed team experiences on three different continents. To achieve this goal, the study was organized in two stages. In the first stage, a framework was developed based on a yearlong mixed-methods study where four engineering teams from two prestigious universities in Chile and the U.S. worked together on open-ended problem-based challenges. Subsequently, the data from other 11 teams including distributed work among students in Chile, the U.S., and Finland, in the period spanning from 2016 to 2017, was collected and analyzed. A time tracking research instrument was created assessing how teams allocate their efforts within the design process and how this allocation varies across co-located and distributed teams. In addition, 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with students from the first stage in order to triangulate the information. Findings show that distributed and co-located teams spend similar amount of time in convergent and divergent design activities. Moreover, evaluators identified improvements in the end solutions designed by students since there seems to be a cultural and academic complementation in the solutions proposed by distributed teams. All teams tend to use more time on convergent activities rather than divergent ones, especially when preparing presentations for a larger class group. Special attention should be paid on the convergent stages of teams' design processes in order to provide the right educational scaffolding to facilitate learning. This study sought to shed a light on the possibilities of working with geographically distributed teams, and we found that, overall, the trade-offs are not significant.;"[Miranda, Constanza; Goni, Julian Inani] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile; [Lugo, Jose] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Mech Engn, PR-108, Mayaguez, PR 00682 USA";;Miranda, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile.;"csmirand@uc.cl; jvgoni@uc.cl; ihillige@ing.puc.cl; jose.lugo2@upr.edu";"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020";"Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416";;;;31;0;0;0;4;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Here we derive in all detail the motion equations in the Brans-Dicke theory with cubic self-interaction. This is a modification of the Brans-Dicke theory by the addition of a term in the Lagrangian which is non-linear in the derivatives of the scalar field: it contains second-order derivatives. This is the basis of the so-called Brans-Dicke Galileon. We pay special attention to the variational principle and to the algebraic details of the derivation. It is shown how higher order derivatives of the fields appearing in the intermediate computations cancel out leading to second order motion equations. The reader will find useful tips for the derivation of the field equations of modifications of general relativity such as the scalar-tensor theories and f (R) theories, by means of the (stationary action) variational principle. The content of this paper is particularly recommended to those graduate and postgraduate students who are interested in the study of the mentioned modifications of general relativity.;"[Quiros, Israel; Gonzalez, Tame; Antonio Horta-Rangel, F.] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Ingn Civil, Div Ingn, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Garcia-Salcedo, Ricardo] Legaria Inst Politecn Nacl, CICATA, Mexico City 11500, DF, Mexico; [Saavedra, Joel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Casilla 4950, Valparaiso, Chile";;Quiros, I (corresponding author), Univ Guanajuato, Dept Ingn Civil, Div Ingn, Guanajuato, Mexico.;"iquiros@fisica.ugto.mx; rigarcias@ipn.mx; tamegc72@gmail.com";;"HORTA-RANGEL, FRANCISCO ANTONIO/0000-0002-0939-2317; Garcia-Salcedo, Ricardo/0000-0003-0173-5466";"COFAA-IPN grant; EDI-IPN grant; CONACyT of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT);  [SIP20150188];  [SIP20160512]";The authors acknowledge very useful comments by Bartolome Alles, Kazuya Koyama and Sergei Odintsov.

Evidence suggests differences in HLE components based on cultural and idiosyncratic characteristics. Most studies show a relationship between contextual variables with the quality of HLE in typically developing (TD) children. There are HLE studies with families of children with Down syndrome (DS) that show similar results, but the characteristics of HLE for Latin-American families of children with DS remain unexplored. This study analyses the HLE in a group of 161 families of children with DS, between 3 and 12 years of age, living in urban areas of Chile. Data were collected using an online survey. Results showed differences on the amount of literacy materials, linguistic environment, and beliefs and expectations of parents. Better HLE was observed in families with parents with high educational levels. In the context of previous studies from developed countries with families of children with DS and from Chile with families of TD children, the HLE of families with children with DS in Chile seems poor.

In previous research, concept keyboards (CK) were successfully used to implement a software system supporting the learning of classical algorithms, like QuickSort and Dijkstra's algorithm, among others. Traditional visualization software normally offers the learner an animated representation of the algorithm with the possibility of controlling the execution of the right steps, giving the learner a more or less passive role. Concept keyboards allow the learner to control the execution of the algorithm by deciding which function should be performed when. Four cryptographic protocols were implemented and tested (Wide Mouth Frog, Feige-Fiat-Shamir, Needham-Schroeder and Kerberos V). A it initial evaluation confirmed that the use of the CK fosters comprehension of the algorithms, facilitates the learning process and stimulates the learners' activity.;"[Baloian, Nelson] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Cs, Santiago, Chile; [Luther, Wolfram] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany";;Baloian, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Cs, Santiago, Chile.;"nbaloian@dcc.uchile.cl; luther@inf.uni-due.de";Baloian, Nelson/J-3718-2016;Baloian, Nelson/0000-0003-1608-6454;FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1060797];we thank our master's thesis students for their valuable contributions.

This study consisted of two phases starting with designing a chemistry education for the sustainable development-based learning environment of reaction kinetics, followed by a case study in which students' perceptions toward learning chemistry by solving a real environmental problem using digital resources, spreadsheets, and an active learning environment, were explored. First, we designed a Socio-Scientific Environmental Chemistry module centered on the sorption kinetic processes of herbicides in volcanic ash derived soils (VADS) and their potential to pollute groundwater. The objective of the learning module was to contribute to the development of sustainability skills, to promote learning of contextualized chemistry knowledge, and to develop scientific skills. This module employs spreadsheets as computational tools in chemistry to model real sorption kinetic data of herbicides in VADS. The learning module was designed for one section of two Analytical Chemistry courses and one Physical Chemistry course of an undergraduate chemistry teacher-training program. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in each course, and students' perceptions were gathered using the focus group technique. The sample was of 22 students distributed into three focus groups. The data collected were analyzed and categorized through qualitative content analysis using the Technological Pedagogical Science Knowledge (TPASK) framework. On the basis of our findings, the students acquired contextualized chemistry knowledge and develop skills and knowledge related to using digital resources and spreadsheets in a scientific context. Besides, the preservice chemistry teachers' knowledge of pedagogy allowed them to develop some elements of their pedagogical science knowledge and TPASK. This case study shows that the problem-based learning approach offers great potential in supporting a learning environment suitable to working with spreadsheets to solve real-environment problems in chemistry education.;"[Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Jorquera-Moreno, Barbara; Druker-Ibanez, Sofia; Hernandez-Ramos, Jose] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Lab Quim Mat, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] CEDENNA, Ctr Dev Nanosci & Nanotechnol, Santiago 9170124, Chile; [Diaz-Arce, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Philosophy & Educ, Dept Special Educ, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, Helsinki 00014, Finland";;Caceres-Jensen, L (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile.;lyzethly.caceres@umce.cl;"Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017";"Cáceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Hernandez Ramos, Jose/0000-0001-8871-8495; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X";"Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [DIUMCE FGI 36-17, FGI-46-18]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 11110421, CEDENNA FB-0807]";This work was supported through DIUMCE FGI 36-17 and FGI-46-18 (Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile), FONDECYT 11110421 (CONICYT, Chile), CEDENNA FB-0807 (CONICYT, Chile).

We discuss the various experimental and theoretical aspects of this classic problem. Careful time-resolved force measurements allow us to determine the differences between the idealized problem and its implementation in the laboratory. We observe that, in spite of the upward force exerted by the pan on the chain, the free end at the top falls faster than a freely falling body. Because a real chain exhibits a finite minimum radius of curvature, the contact at the bottom results in a tensional force, which pulls the falling part downward.

The first critical step of the PMEL framework requires thoughtful exploration of `` pathways'' to community change: a series of proposed actions that lead to a set of positive outcomes within the community. In this study, we investigate the benefit of using Group Model Building (GMB) as a way to improve the outcome of brainstorming sessions, a key aspect of team decision making within this first step of the PMEL framework. Here we posit an important mechanism for an improved outcome in brainstorming sessions would be a shift in student mental models towards system thinking. In order to assess the value proposition of GMB in project decision making, a two-session GMB workshop was held with a EWB-USA student team working on a rural water project in Peru. A mixed-methods approach was used to extract and analyze participant mental models before and after the workshop to measure growth in systems thinking. The results of the study indicate compelling shifts in participants' mental models towards those of systems thinkers, including an understanding of important factors and how they influence as a system to impact project sustainability. Marked changes in project planning action items were also observed along with an alignment of their proposed change pathways. Overall, the project team gained a more complete understanding and appreciation of project complexity and of the factors that contribute to project success. Thus, GMBprovides a useful technique to teach engineering students systems thinking, while possibly improving the quality, and thus sustainability, of EWB community development projects.;"[Walters, Jeffrey P.] Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Ave Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Greiner, Benjamin; Amadei, Bernard] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 1111 Engn Dr,ECOT512, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [O'Morrow, Emily] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA";;Walters, JP (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Ave Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.;"jeffrey.walters@udp.cl; benjamin.greiner@colorado.edu; emily.omorrow@colorado.edu; amadei@colorado.edu";;Walters, Jeffrey/0000-0001-6655-1233;;;;62;2;2;0;10;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

In the present study, we investigate students' perceptions of physics' relevance by comparing results by country, student semester, and gender. This is a quantitative comparative study between engineering students from Mexico and Chile. A total of 1,323 engineering students enrolled in physics courses in two private universities from those countries in their first and third semester responded to an eleven-item 5-Likert scale-type statements survey. Results showed that students in their first semester perceive the importance of physics more positively than students in their third semester. In general, students in the Mexican university have higher perceptions of physics' importance in engineering than students in the Chilean institution. Male and female students have similar perceptions about the relevance of physics. However, female students have a slightly higher perception of physics' importance for their ongoing studies in engineering than their male peers in the Mexican institution, opposite to what the results show in the Chilean institution. Reflecting upon the results and discussion of this contribution, some recommendations are: redesign physics courses to include activities in which students are in contact with real-life situations in classes, emphasizing the engineering part of the problem; promote active learning strategies in which students participate in the construction of their learning by interdisciplinary and gender-perspective approaches; and, include the student perspective in the curriculum and teaching materials by involving the higher-year students to demonstrate the relevance of physics to their first-year peers.

In an effort to balance the rigorous academic technical requirements of an engineering degree, entrepreneurship programs leverage both curricular and co-curricular programming, offering students different paths to entrepreneurship development. However, little is known about the distribution of these opportunities amongst different groups of students. The purpose of this investigation is to examine whether the pathways to entrepreneurship education are influenced by student characteristics. Institution and participation data of 1,018 undergraduate students were collected from an entrepreneurship program anchored in a large, Midwest, public research university, college of engineering, center for entrepreneurship. Logistic regressions were used to examine the differences and similarities between students enrolling an entrepreneurship curricular program and their participation in co-curricular activities. Our data indicates that gender, nationality, and grade point average (GPA) are key factors in determining the type of entrepreneurship participation students choose to pursue in the university environment. We also found evidence of the curricular program acting as a gateway to engagement with entrepreneurship beyond the classroom.

Eighteen forearms of cadaveric specimens were evaluated arthroscopically, of which 12 were selected according to the inclusion criteria. All specimens were injured with an Atzei type II lesion and were repaired arthroscopically. Six forearms were repaired using the anchor technique and the other six with the pull-out technique. To assess the biomechanical resistance of the repair, the forearms were tested to 300 cycles of 160 degrees pronosupination. Two evaluators independently assessed the repair status every 10 cycles and the modified Desai classification was used to verify the presence of failure. The mean failure of the repair occurred at 41.6 cycles (SD 7.5) for the pull-out technique and at 28.3 cycles (SD 9.8) for the anchor technique, showing a difference of 13.3 cycles (p = 0.025) in favor of the pull-out technique. In all cases, repair failure occurred at the junction of the fibrocartilage with the suture. Arthroscopic repair with the pull-out technique showed greater biomechanical resistance to pronosupination movement in comparison to the anchor technique. Interestingly, the failure of arthroscopic repair of Atzei type II lesions occurs at the junction between the suture and the fibrocartilage.;"[Gutierrez-Monclus, Rodrigo] Hand Team Traumatol Inst Santiago, Santiago, Chile; [Ferreres, Angel] Inst Kaplan, Barcelona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Baeza, Alfonso] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Med, Barcelona, Spain; [Gutierrez-Espinoza, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Med, Dept Ciencias Morfol, Barcelona, Spain; [Gutierrez-Espinoza, Hector] Univ Gabriela Mistral, Sch Hlth Sci, Physiotherapy Dept, Santiago, Chile";;Gutierrez-Monclus, R (corresponding author), Traumatol Inst, San Martin St 771, Santiago 8320000, Chile.;rgutierrezmonclus4@gmail.com;Gutierrez Espinoza, Hector Joaquin/S-3596-2017;Gutierrez Espinoza, Hector Joaquin/0000-0002-4650-3426;;;;18;0;0;2;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0036-8504;2047-7163;;SCI PROGRESS-UK;Sci.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Mothers and children were surveyed in their homes or at schools in Temuco, Chile. Participants: A total of 300 mothers (average age, 41.6 years) and their adolescent children (average age, 13.2 years; 48.7% female). Main Outcome Measures: Maternal feeding practices using the abbreviated Family Food Behavior Survey (AFFBS),life satisfaction, food-related and family life satisfaction, diet quality, and eating habits. Analysis: Principal component factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to verify Family Food Behavior Survey components in mother and adolescent subsamples. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify profiles. Results: Three AFFBS components were detected: maternal control of child snacking behavior, maternal presence during eating, and child involvement in food consumption. Cluster analysis identified 3 mother-adolescent dyad profiles with different food-related parenting practices (P <= .001), mother (P <= .05) and child (P <= .001) diet quality, frequency of shared family meals (P <= .001), and mother (P <= .001) and child (P <= .05) life satisfaction levels. Conclusions and Implications: Results indicated that maternal well-being increased with an increased frequency of shared mealtime. Significantly, in contrast to the findings of previous studies, greater control over child eating habits was shown to affect adolescent well-being positively. These findings, among others, may contribute to the development of strategies for improving diet quality, overall well-being, and wellbeing in the food and family domains for all family members.";"[Schnettler, Berta] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Schnettler, Berta; Denegri, Marianela; Hueche, Clementina] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Excelencia Psicol Econ & Consumo, Nucleo Cient & Tecnol Ciencias Sociales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Grunert, Klaus G.] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Lobos, German] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile; [Miranda-Zapata, Edgardo] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Cient & Tecnol Ciencias Sociales, LICSA, Temuco, Chile; [Denegri, Marianela] Univ La Frontera, Fac Educ Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile";;Schnettler, B (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile.;berta.schnettler@ufrontera.cl;"LOBOS, GERMAN/V-8128-2019; Denegri, Marianela/AAU-9898-2021; Zapata, Edgardo Miranda/AAO-3318-2020";"LOBOS, GERMAN/0000-0002-6155-4870; Miranda-Zapata, Edgardo/0000-0003-3359-3052";Conicyt, Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160005];This work was supported by Conicyt, Fondecyt Project No. 1160005.;;52;17;17;1;13;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;1499-4046;1878-2620;;J NUTR EDUC BEHAV;J.

As a result, employees concentrate on day-to-day activities with little time or motivation to generate creative ideas. Generally, the technological improvements of these companies arise as a result of problem-solving at the construction site. Nevertheless, the actual status quo is changing. Some Spanish public agencies are already considering innovation as an added value in public procurement; thus, large contractors are starting to systemize their innovative efforts. This means that small-sized and medium-sized enterprises must modify their attitudes towards innovation in order to sustain their competitiveness. The implementation of a system that enhances innovation and acquisition of knowledge may be the solution to overcome this disadvantage. The implementation of an innovation management system was analyzed in a Spanish construction firm of medium size for 9 years. The system builds on a set of processes aimed to generate innovation projects that allow the contractor to document the innovation, not only for internal purposes related to knowledge management, but also for external ones associated with obtaining better results in public tenders. These processes are as follows: (1)technology watch, (2)creativity, (3)planning and executing innovation projects, (4)technology transfer, and (5)protection of results. The final step is the feedback of the entire process through the assessment of the final outcomes. The implementation of the innovation system is ensured within the organization, through training of personnel, participation of stakeholders, and encouragement of the innovation culture.

This program uses the conceptual change approach as a framework in a recursive way, and it is specially designed to promote and ensure the use of active and innovative methodologies. The development program consists of six steps that aim to strengthen a learning community that fosters interaction of professors with common problems, interests, and experiences in a way that the collegial work sustains over time the dynamic and improved incorporation of active methodologies for teaching and learning. For this paper, we focus on the structure and some results. The results are related to faculty, students and institutional perceptions. We have evidence that faculty in this program changes their own perceptions as instructors towards reflecting whether their role is less regarding to transmitting knowledge, notes, and presentations to students. In the case of students, after a survey in courses in which participants were implementing educational strategies from the program, students' view is positive towards the activities. Students indicated that they learned more and that those strategies should be used in other courses. Institutionally, the achievements of faculty in the program and the program itself received recognition by the university.;"[Dominguez, Angeles] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey, Mexico; [Dominguez, Angeles; Elena Truyol, Maria; Zavala, Genaro] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile; [Zavala, Genaro] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, Mexico";;"Dominguez, A (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey, Mexico.; Dominguez, A (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile.";"angeles.dominguez@tec.mx; maria.truyol@unab.cl; genaro.zavala@tec.mx";"Zavala, Genaro/P-7190-2016; DOMINGUEZ, Angeles/B-8879-2016";"Zavala, Genaro/0000-0001-5880-1124; DOMINGUEZ, Angeles/0000-0001-6066-355X";School of Engineering at Universidad Andres Bello;We would like to thank the School of Engineering at Universidad Andres Bello for all the support received throughout this project, to the participating faculty for all their enthusiasm, believing in the process, and for accepting the challenge of building a better education for our students.;;19;4;4;0;10;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Based on the Learning Spiral as a framework for curriculum design in connectivisim and in the co-association, it created lessons, activities, and projects in order to create dynamic learning situations that contribute to the development of thinking skills and mental habits of first-year college students of technical engineering education at the Higher Technical Network Administration and Computational Support of the Lota Arauco Technical Training Center at the University of Concepcion. To analyze the experience, it proposed an evaluation model that was built using ICT, evaluative principles, a defined competencies standard, evidence and types of ICT assessment. As data instrument collection, rubrics were used that allowed to determine what students did with and without ICT. Main results of this experience are the generation of a methodological and evaluative model that facilitates theoretical learning, from the paradigm of learning using ICT, for example to promote higher competencies development in students, incorporating ICT seamlessly into a learning activity, increasing motivation and collaborative work in the physical and virtual classrooms.;"[Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Educ Comp Unit, Concepcion, Chile; [Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Carrasco Saez, Jose Luis] Univ Concepcion, Lota Arauco Tech Training Ctr, ICT Area, Concepcion, Chile; [Prats Fernandez, Miquel Angel] Univ Ramon Llull, FPCEE Blanquerna, Barcelona, Spain";;Quintana, MGB (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Educ Comp Unit, Alonso de Ribera Ave 2850, Concepcion, Chile.;"mgbadilla@ucsc.cl; jlcarrasc@cftlotarauco.cl; miquelpf@blanquerna.url.edu";"Badilla, Maria/T-3880-2019; Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela/B-3142-2017; Prats Fernández, Miquel Àngel/D-5394-2014";"Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela/0000-0002-1317-9228; Prats Fernández, Miquel Àngel/0000-0002-9542-7888";;;;30;4;4;1;32;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

These include problem-based learning or collaborative learning. In certain areas, such as engineering, project-led learning collects some of the benefits of problem-based learning and integrates others that are of interest to the formation of engineers. More recently, project-led education as an integral strategy has been demonstrated in several European universities with impressive results. Students have a lower dropout rate, a lower period of adaptation to professional practice and better soft skills. While this implementation requires a general model change, at least at the faculty level, partial strategies applied in specific courses could pick up some of the positive aspects of these methodologies. In this paper, obtained results in a second-year Unit Operations course (grade of bioengineering) by applying this type of partial strategies are discussed. The student's acceptance was good, and both motivation and academic results improved significantly. It was observed a deeper and wider knowledge acquisition in the students. Teacher's workload increased, although, as there was a maximum of 25 students, it was manageable. It was concluded that transition from traditional to project-led learning strategies can be done within a subject without an educational model change at faculty or university level.

Developing quality standards and measuring learning levels can be difficult enough from campus to campus within a particular country. However, exporting and adapting such standards across countries and educational traditions and cultures is even more challenging. The present paper describes the portability of one system of assessment developed at a U.S. institution as applied to two engineering faculties in Chile. The process followed during the initial training and development provides some good insights into how assessment and quality improvement processes can be quickly implemented. However, the implementation required cultural shifts in how the program approached, and administrators and faculty thought about, assessment for quality improvement. The experience in Chile provides some lessons on the opportunities and potential pitfalls of carrying out such a process in other countries and programs.;"[Sheahan, T.

Therefore, because BIM is a collaborative working methodology, it is not possible to effectively teach BIM without the use of collaborative teamwork. Traditionally, teaching at universities has promoted individual student learning and development through lectures and examinations. The objective of this paper was to analyze the interactions in student teams when project- and team-based teaching methodologies are applied. To evaluate the interactions, we used the technique of social network analysis (SNA), and to evaluate the students' effort, we measured the number of hours dedicated to individual work and teamwork over 15 weeks. This research highlights the importance of collaborative work in the process of training students for careers in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry in BIM technology environments. The work was performed practically using real construction projects that were completed by student teams. The measurement of interactions was carried out using SNA, which allowed us to determine the density of interactions within each group. Teams that work more hours collaboratively than individually become better integrated, which is a feature that is also recognized in the individual achievements of their members.;"[Herrera, Rodrigo F.; Munoz-La Rivera, Felipe; Vielma, Juan C.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Civil Engn, Ave Brasil 2147, Valparaiso 23662804, Spain; [Herrera, Rodrigo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Santiago, Chile; [Herrera, Rodrigo F.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia, Spain";;"Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Civil Engn, Ave Brasil 2147, Valparaiso 23662804, Spain.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Santiago, Chile.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia, Spain.";"mdrigo.herrera@pucv.cl; felipe.munoz@pucv.cl; juan.vielma@pucv.cl";"Muñoz La Rivera, Felipe/AAX-9588-2021; Vielma-Perez, Juan C./C-6863-2018; Herrera, Rodrigo/N-3909-2017";"Vielma-Perez, Juan C./0000-0001-5426-2215; Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5186-3154";;;;27;2;2;7;29;ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS;RESTON;1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA;2643-9107;2643-9115;;J CIV ENG EDUC;J.

In total, 498 school-level teachers completed the survey. Subsequently, nine teachers participated in focus-group interviews. The survey revealed overall support for teaching grammar via communicative methods. However, in the interview data, three types of conflicting beliefs were identified. First, theoretical conflicts pertained to the role that grammatical knowledge plays in developing communicative skills. Second, experiential conflicts were based on the teachers' unsuccessful experiences in using pair and group activities that resulted in a lack of student engagement. Third, contextual conflicts entailed beliefs about the compatibility of communicative teaching with the local socio-educational context. Teaching experiences positively and negatively mediated the conflicting beliefs. Overall, teachers' beliefs about how a L2 should be learned entailed a different set of beliefs from those about how a L2 can be taught. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, to clinical use, digital technology is focused on the education and training of students. The objective of this study was to show the potential benefit of the use of digital CAD / CAM technology and assisted training software in the evaluation and improvement of student skills in preclinical and clinical environments. Materials and Methods 30 models of dental preparations were digitalised and analysed by PrepCheck software, after that was used the PrepCheck Report tool, gathering the results of the analysis in an automatically created report and containing the following parameters: analysis of the conicity, distance between a preparation and the opposing jaw, analysis of the type of preparation, quality of the margin and total occlusal convergence. Results The use of the PrepCheck Pro 2.1 software makes evident the errors made by the students during the biomechanical preparation, since they generally change the inclination, in order to have less difficulties to comply with the parameters established in the preparations. Regarding the evaluated parameters for anterior and posterior fixed prosthesis) such as: 'Conicity', 'Type of preparation' and 'Distance to the antagonist', the preparations, in their majority, were classified within the tolerance range with of 50-60%, 80-93% and 53-67%, respectively. Conclusion This pilot study demonstrated the benefits of using software and CAD/CAM technology in both preclinical and clinical environments for teaching and learning. Its use on preclinical environments allows the student observe qualitatively and quantitatively a preparation flaws when compared to a master's preparation.

By employing competence-based and performance-based measurements, the study also explores conceptual gaps regarding oral fluency between Second Language Acquisition and Language Testing research. The participants were 56 Japanese university-level learners of English and four native English speakers who rated the learners' oral fluency. The verbal protocol data showed that temporal aspects (e.g., pauses) and interaction-specific features (e.g., turn-taking) were interwoven, indicating that joint performance between the interactants is a constituent of the construct of interactional oral fluency. The statistical analyses revealed that learners' individual performance does not necessarily predict how they will perform in an interactional context, challenging the assumption that L2 specific processing is stably manifested in performance regardless of context.

A randomized experiment;INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Active learning; Peer instruction; Classroom experiments; Course performance; Innovation in teaching";"FLIPPED CLASSROOM; SCIENCE";Studies consistently show that active learning improves student satisfaction, but results on achievement are less conclusive. We address this puzzle by comparing an active learning classroom that employs peer instruction with a traditional lecture using an experimental design in a Chilean Economics and Business school. Students in the treatment group are more satisfied with the course and have better grades, but the treatment effect varies as the semester progresses: small at the beginning, larger in the middle, and nonexistent in the final exam. Our hypothesis is that the treatment changed student effort. Students performed better under peer instruction and may have decided to decrease their effort toward the end of the semester. We present evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Additionally, students in the treatment group perceived that the most important part of the treatment was the greater interaction with the professor, and they reported studying less with their peers outside of class.;"[Alcalde, Pilar; Nagel, Juan] Univ los Andes, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Av Monsenor Alvaro Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile";;Alcalde, P (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Av Monsenor Alvaro Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile.;palcalde@uandes.cl;;;Universidad de los Andes' Fondo de Ayuda a la Investigacion (FAI);The authors wish to thank the Universidad de los Andes' Fondo de Ayuda a la Investigacion (FAI) research grant for financial assistance.

The Internet Addiction Test (IAT) is a screening instrument used to detect IA worldwide, which was published in 1998 and inspired by the DSM-IV criteria for pathologic gambling. The objective of this study aims to measure the prevalence of IA in Chilean medical students and its possible association with demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Methods First- to fifth-year undergraduate medical students at a medical school in Santiago de Chile answered a self-administered survey that included demographic data, the IAT scale, and the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to screen for IA and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results Three hundred eighty-four students participated, achieving a response rate of 69.8 %, of which 11.5 % were classified as problematic users according to the IAT.

The aim of this research was to determine empathy in dentists in the process of specialisation. Materials and Methods Through an observational and cross-sectional study, all postgraduate students of Dentistry Faculty of Universidad Andres Bello (Chile) were analysed (N = 195). The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy Scale was applied. Results The results show an adequate reliability of the empathy measure (alpha = 0.819, omega = 0.928). A three-factor structure is evidenced by confirmatory factor analysis (chi(2)/df = 1.445, GFI = 0.952, RMSEA = 0.047) and adequate factor invariance between men and women. Women showed greater empathy on the global scale and in the perspective adoption dimension, with no gender differences found in the dimension Compassionate care and putting oneself in the other's shoes (POOS). The median empathy reaches 120 points. Below, are placed, the specialty of oral rehabilitation (Med = 114.5), surgery (Med = 117) and periodontics (Med. = 117.5). With superior scores, temporomandibular disorder (Med. = 121), endodontics (Med. = 121), Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics Med. = 122), Implantology (Med. = 125) and Pediatric dentistry (Med. = 127.5) are located. Conclusion Women were more empathetic than men. In general, empathy levels are relatively high, but the common feature in which all students examined in different specialties have low levels in dimension POOS.;"[Diaz-Narvaez, Victor; Gonzalez-Valenzuela, Catalina; Cornejo-Fernandez, Nicole] Univ Andres Bello, Dent Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Oyarzun-Munoz, Marcela] Univ los Andes, Dent Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Social Sci & Commun, Concepcion, Chile; [Calzadilla-Nunez, Aracelis] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Hlth Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Calzadilla-Nunez, Aracelis] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Hlth Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Martinez, Pilar Torres] Univ San Sebastian, Dent Fac, Concepcion, Chile";;Diaz-Narvaez, V (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dent Fac, Echaurren 237, Santiago Centro, Region Metropol, Chile.;victor.diaz@unab.cl;Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro/AAO-4342-2021;Reyes-Reyes, Alejandro/0000-0002-2404-0467;;;;78;0;0;1;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

Research has generally focused on a single type of loss, with only a handful of studies exploring the accumulation of losses in old age and examining which and how many losses are experienced, and how intense they are. The lack of instruments that reflect the diversity of the losses that individuals can sustain at this stage of life makes it difficult to accumulate knowledge in this field, since it is not possible to characterize this experience or establish associations with other significant variables. Based on a prior categorization of six types of losses, developed upon the basis of reports by older adults, we sought to construct and validate a Scale of Losses Experienced in Old Age (SLO). This scale underwent semantic validation, followed by content validation. Afterward, for the construct validation process, it was administered to a pilot sample of 249 middle-income community-dwelling older adults. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded adequate values (RMSEA = 0.060, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.961, SRMR = 0.075), with internal consistency also being suitable (ordinal alpha = 0.856). These values warrant recommending the use of the SLO, since it offers a view of losses in old age that is both broad and detailed, thus facilitating the production of cumulative and comparable knowledge in the field of psychogerontology while also making it possible to establish interdisciplinary connections.;"[Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Gerosci Ctr Brain Hlth & Metab GERO, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Mayor, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile; [Assar, Rodrigo; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Biomed Sci ICBM, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Arnold-Cathalifaud, Marcelo] Univ Chile, Dept Anthropol, Fac Social Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neuropsychol & Clin Neurosci Lab Lannec, Physiopathol Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, East Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Hosp Salvador, Dept Neurol, Memory & Neuropsychiat Clin CMYN, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Lillo, Patricia] Univ Chile, South Neurol Dept, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Desarrollo, Dept Med, Neurol Serv, Clin Alemana, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Aging, Santiago, Chile";;Thumala-Dockendorff, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile.;dthumala@uchile.cl;Slachevsky, Andrea/P-4039-2014;Slachevsky, Andrea/0000-0001-6285-3189;"MULTI-PARTNER CONSORTIUM TO EXPAND DEMENTIA RESEARCH IN LATIN AMERICA (ReDLat) - National Institutes of Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01AG057234]; Alzheimer's AssociationAlzheimer's Association [SG-20-725707-ReDLat]; Rainwater Foundation; Global Brain Health Institute; GBHI;  [ANID/FONDAP/15150012];  [ANID/Fondecyt/1191726]";"This work was supported by ANID/FONDAP/15150012.

J;Pacheco, CS;;;;Silva Pacheco, Cristian;;;Art Education for the Development of Complex Thinking Metacompetence: A Theoretical Approach;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"art; art education; metacompetence; complex thinking";COGNITION;This article proposes to explore the relationships between art education and the development of complex thinking (proposed as metacompetence in this study) from a theoretical perspective. This is an approach that arises from contemporary conceptions about art, which is an intrinsic relationship between the artwork and the creative and critical character towards representation systems. Emphasising the definition of complex thinking proposed by Mathew Lipman serves as a guiding axis to try to establish the cognitive processes that compose it. Among the main findings is that the development of complex thinking and cognition occurs through action and interaction with the environment, thus linking to the notions of 'situated competence' and the 'complex approach to competences'. By including cognitive and metacognitive processes, it allows us to postulate complex thinking as metacompetence. In addition, it is proposed that the use of learning methodologies (under a competence-based approach) could contribute to an art education where students produce artistic works that involve critical, creative processes or divergent results. It is also necessary that both the curriculum and the teachers encourage an expanded and interdisciplinary vision, understanding that art is not circumscribed to a specific discipline.;"[Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile";;"Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile.";crsilvap@utalca.cl;;;PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca;This study was supported by PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca.;;36;3;3;2;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1476-8062;1476-8070;;INT J ART DES EDUC;Int.

In this sense, television programming has come to be redefined as educational, based on the audiences' needs in each of their different home environments. Reception studies show that various programs are frequently classified as educational programs, including news/journalistic programs, entertainment and fictional shows. This presents an opportunity for organizations and professionals of television to contribute to the improvement in the quality of life of their audience members, especially children and adolescents. With regards to the specific challenges that Latin American public television face, it is necessary to shift the axis from propaganda/situational to audiovisual programs that take into account the verbalized needs of various research projects in the region, especially for social groups that suffer not only financial disadvantages, but also those dealing with insecurity and ethnic exclusion.;Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile;;Fuenzalida, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;vfuenza@vtr.net;;;;;;17;11;14;0;25;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2011;18;36;;;;;15;24;;10.3916/C36-2011-02-01;;;10;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";716RY;WOS:000286992400003;;Green Accepted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

This mixed-methods study presents an alternative look at classroom participation by investigating the relationship between second language (L2) thoughts and L2 speech in German as a foreign language learners in a language program in the United States. At four points during an academic semester, 16 students answered an in-class survey that aimed at recording students' estimations of how much of their thoughts had been formulated in the L2 and how much of their speech had been articulated in the L2. A small subset of these students participated in individual stimulated recall interviews to gather their own reflections on their thought processes and L2 speech production. Results show that students' L2 speech production is conditioned by a complex interplay of variables, which results in a mismatch between self-reported L2 thoughts and L2 speech. Several explanations derived from interview data are offered to account for this divergence, such as motivational tendencies, misperceptions of L2 use, the production of rehearsed speech, metalinguistic thoughts in the first language, and conceptions of silence as a valid form of participation.

The results indicate that the educational problems linked to both the identity and the autonomy of the profession, the cultural value associated to professional practice, the existence and reach of the Teachers Associations, political and economic peculiarities, and the considerable influence exercised by Europe and the United States, are all aspects that make Latin American journalism different journalism in the rest of the world.

The aim of this study was to compare the self-reported perceptions of each student-centred teaching technique amongst a group of dental students as well as resultant quiz scores after each teaching technique. Material and Methods During the first semester of 2017, all year-3 (N = 88) Semiology and year-5 (N = 71) Oral Surgery students participated in weekly seminars in which teams of students from both cohorts were given an actual clinical case to study; a diagnosis and treatment plan would be rendered, and an oral case presentation would be presented to the rest of the class. In the second semester, the same students tried to solve similar clinical cases using the fishbowl training format. A course coordinator provided final feedback, and the session culminated with a quiz. Students were invited to provide quantitative and qualitative perceptions whilst quiz scores obtained during seminar and fishbowl teaching formats were compared. Results and Discussion A total of 97 (61%) seminar and 92 (58%) fishbowl students provided insights regarding these teaching techniques. Both cohorts believed the fishbowl format allowed them to be actively involved. However, only year-3 students gave the fishbowl format a significantly higher score than the seminar format, considering it an attractive format that allowed them to learn. In contrast, year-5 students believed the seminars met their expectations better than the fishbowl format. Interesting clinical cases as well as the final round of feedback were qualitative themes reported by both cohorts. The mean seminar and fishbowl quiz scores were statistically significant different for year-3 students (P < 0.0001), but not for year-5 students (P = 0.09).

We use the revealed preferences of students for college major choice by taking advantage of Chile's Centralized Admission System, and estimate a nested logit model to predict the first preference of applicants. We find that males apply to selective programs even when they are marginal candidates, while equally qualified female candidates tend to apply less often to these programs. Using counterfactual exercises, we conclude that to successfully address the gender gap, along with promoting females' participation in STEM careers, we must increase males' willingness to consider non-STEM fields.

Although these digital resources support and motivate them to learn, these are also a source of continuous distraction. This research analyzes the impact of studying with handwritten notes, WhatsApp, YouTube and searching the Internet in academic performance, through a mixed method that combines 3 I focus groups and a survey of 7217 students from 12 to 18 years of age in Chile. The results of the focus groups show that the positive impact of technologies in learning would depend on the students' motivation for learning, their ability to efficiently control and manage the available digital resources, and their capacity to search and evaluate information on the Internet. The survey concludes that those who study with their notes more frequently have better academic performance, whereas those who frequently study with YouTube and WhatsApp have a lower GPA, with no significant differences when it comes to internet browsing.

Members are both disciplined by state technologies, but are also actively committed to produce school identity narratives in creative ways as a manner to make sense of the school and maintain its value.;[Falabella, Alejandra] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile;;Falabella, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.;afalabel@uahurtado.cl;;FALABELLA, ALEJANDRA/0000-0003-2755-4911;;;;19;9;11;1;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-5692;1465-3346;;BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC;Br.

The first topic is a Treasury bill auction experiment in which students have an opportunity to participate directly. The results from a class of 14 money and banking students are used to explain how an instructor might conduct such an experiment in the classroom. Relatively simple algebraic models are also developed for 2 types of stock market transactions: short selling and margin buying. Three analytical exercises are presented with complete solutions to demonstrate how an instructor might assign related problems for students. These experiments and models give students a lasting understanding of a number of rarely discussed topics in money and banking courses.;Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile;;Saros, DE (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;dan.saros@valpo.edu;;;;;;6;1;1;0;0;HELDREF PUBLICATIONS;WASHINGTON;1319 EIGHTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-1802 USA;0022-0485;;;J ECON EDUC;J.

Consistency among those teaching in Jesuit high schools across the Americas;BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Teaching approaches; meaning of work; Catholic school; Catholic Education";;This study uncovers the meanings that secondary teachers working under the religious structure of Jesuit institutions attach to their work. I draw on theoretical insights coming from organisational behaviour. I use cases of teachers who worked or work in Catholic high schools run by the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuit order. I interviewed 105 teachers, lay and Jesuit priests, who teach in the United States, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. The findings reveal that the participating teachers create meaning of their work using the building blocks of the self, others, the work context, and the spiritual life and that Teachers in the study showed a relatively similar pattern of making meaning in their work using four sources of meaning: others, the work context, the self, and spiritual life. There is no evidence that neither the professional status (being a Jesuit teacher or a lay teacher) nor the geographical setting of the teachers, mark a difference within the different meanings attributed to being a teacher in this particular educational context.;[Madero, Cristobal] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ & Desarrollo Escolar, Santiago, Chile;;Madero, C (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ & Desarrollo Escolar, Santiago, Chile.;cmadero@uahurtado.cl;;Madero, Cristobal/0000-0001-6585-0776;;;;42;0;0;1;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0141-6200;1740-7931;;BRIT J RELIG EDUC;Brit.

This article reports on a research project that investigated how a set core practices are integrated into the Methods courses and practicums in Chilean language teacher education programs for English as a foreign language (EFL). The study was framed by a two-stage, sequential data collection strategy based on a questionnaire (n = 48) and semi-structured interviews (n = 21) to university-based, Chilean English teacher educators. The questionnaire identified teaching practices in use, whilst the interviews sought to understand how teacher educators taught these identified teaching practices, as well as the rationale for these choices. Two practices - facilitating target language comprehensibility and building discourse communities - emerged as the most prominent practices. Primarily, these practices were taught through modelling, decomposing, planning and simulations. However, potentially more complex issues around translanguaging, inclusion strategies and cultural practices tended to be framed using more directive and teacher-centred pedagogies. The outcomes of the study highlight several critical issues for L2 teacher education: the relative balance between theoretical and practical domains often compounded by the lack of meaningful opportunities for authentic classroom practice; and the significant challenges faced by teacher educators by engaging in 'practice' in a crowded program structure.";"[Barahona, Malba] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile";;Barahona, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;maria.barahona@uc.cl;"; Barahona, Malba/L-7610-2016";"Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451; Barahona, Malba/0000-0003-4587-5794";ANID/FONDECYT [1210867, 1210392];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by ANID/FONDECYT 1210867 and ANID/FONDECYT 1210392.;;33;0;0;2;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1362-1688;1477-0954;;LANG TEACH RES;Lang.

During the 2020 pandemic, school closures have posed additional challenges to educators seeking to engage learners and provide egalitarian access to learning opportunities. Approach: This case study documents a collaborative materials design process when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Chilean schools into remote lessons for a whole school year. The collaboration was based on a small professional learning network consisting of two pre-service teachers and two teacher educators. Two questions were posed: (1) What learning and circumstantial needs had to be considered for materials design and for the process of making the materials accessible to a diverse group of Year-9 EFL learners? (2) What were the benefits and challenges for this networked learning system when searching for solutions? Findings: The combination of different access modes to materials, including paper-based worksheets and social networking, and the provision of internet access to facilitate video conferences, helped to overcome some but not all of the limitations caused by the lack of political commitment to offer solutions at a macro level. Based on a framework that combined principles of Differentiated Instruction, Universal Design for Learning, multimodality and bilingual support, the team developed materials at an appropriate level for most students. However, difficulties regarding differentiation between different learner levels persisted. Value: This study sheds light on the affordances and challenges of a collaborative materials design process in which educators join perspectives to provide materials for greater educational justice in FL classrooms.;"[Glas, Katharina; Catalan, Erica; Donner, Marcel; Donoso, Carla] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Av El Bosque 1290,Ed ILCL,Of 7-9, Vina Del Mar, Chile";;Glas, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Av El Bosque 1290,Ed ILCL,Of 7-9, Vina Del Mar, Chile.;katharina.glas@pucv.cl;;Glas, Katharina/0000-0002-8214-1725;Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [PMI UCV1897];This work was supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (PMI UCV1897).;;40;0;0;5;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-1229;1750-1237;;INNOV LANG LEARN TEA;Innov.

Researching this age group is relevant given that adolescence is a key period in people's civic socialization. This study explores how 13 to 17 year old Chileans consume news, in a multiple-platform, convergent and mobile media context. There are few studies that focus on the information habits of this particular age group. Using a quantitative self-administered questionnaire applied to 2,273 high school adolescents from four different regions in the country, this paper analyses participants' news consumption habits, their interest in news, their perception about the importance of different topics, and their motivations to being informed. The results show that surveyed teenagers access information mainly via social media like Facebook, to the detriment of traditional media. These adolescents are least interested in traditional politics, but they think this is the most prominent topic in the news. Their motivations to consume news have to do with their wish to be able to defend their points of view and deliver information to others. Also, they think that their portrayal in the news agenda is both inadequate and negative. These findings suggest that the news industry has a pending debt with young audiences.;"[Condeza, Rayen; Bachmann, Ingrid; Mujica, Constanza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Commun, Santiago, Chile";;Condeza, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Commun, Santiago, Chile.;"rcondeza@uc.cl; ibachman@uc.cl; mcmujica@uc.cl";;;;;;47;22;23;2;49;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JUL 1;2014;22;43;;;;;55;64;;10.3916/C43-2014-05;;;10;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";AK0UB;WOS:000338130200007;;Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;
J;Marini, G;;;;Marini, Guillermo;;;Aristotelic Learning Through the Arts;STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Aristotle; Poetics; Learning; Poiesis; Mimesis; Possible";"EDUCATION; PHILOSOPHY; EXPERIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; MIMESIS";"The field of Philosophy and Education seems to be experiencing a renewed interest in the work of Aristotle. As recently reviewed by Curren (Oxf Rev Educ 36(5):543-559, 2010), most of this attention aligns with the virtue ethics movement where themes like moral development in education, and the inquiry on human flourishing as the aim of education are prevalent. For sources, this scholarship relies heavily and extensively on the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics' Book VIII where Aristotle develops his single, clearly defined account of education. Among the short list of scholars who include Poetics in their research, their work seems to return to issues of morality and education (Carr in J Aesthet Educ 44(3):1-15, 2010; Gupta in J Aesthet Educ 44(4):60-80, 2010). This paper is an attempt to rediscover Aristotle's insights on the peculiar type of learning that the arts seem to favor. In order to carry on this investigation, I will first guide my argument towards Aristotle's remarks on poiesis. Then, I will focus on what constitutes the heart of poiesis, that is, mimesis. I will pay special attention to Aristotle's consideration of both poiesis and mimesis as ultimately dealing with what he calls possibility. I will argue that learning in the arts entails the coming together of these three qualities. This would be a way of learning characterized by seeing human likenesses emerge as such in our interactions with artworks.";Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile;;Marini, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile.;gmarini@uc.cl;;Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151;;;;16;6;6;0;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0039-3746;1573-191X;;STUD PHILOS EDUC;Stud.

Amid the increasing research on mindsets in the L2 field, two issues warrant further research to improve our understanding of how mindsets affect L2 learning. First, research has largely been product-oriented and mindsets' impacts on learning processes are under-investigated. Second, the research has rarely examined actual behaviors, especially in an interactional context. Participants were university-level EFL learners in Chile (N = 42). They were paired according to their mindsets, resulting in three pairing patterns and seven pairs for each pattern: Growth-Growth (G-G), Growth-Fixed (G-F), and Fixed-Fixed (F-F). During regular classes, the pairs engaged in decision-making tasks. Two propensities were focused upon. First, problem-solving behaviors were operationalized as language-related episodes (LREs) in which learners worked together to solve linguistic issues. Second, collaborative learning was analyzed using Storch's framework of the degree of collaboration. In total, 384 LREs were identified. The comparisons among the three pairing patterns showed that (a) growth-mindset learners tended to initiate LREs, (b) F-F pairs engaged in the least number of LREs, and (c) G-G pairs resolved the most LREs proportionally. However, growth-mindset learners did not necessarily engage in collaborative interaction and some exhibited negative behaviors (e.g. negative perfectionism). Together, the study suggests that while growth-mindset positively contributes to problem solving, the individually-held beliefs do not necessarily translate to social contexts such as peer interaction in the classroom.;[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile;;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.;masatoshi.sato@unab.cl;;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; PIA from the the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CIE160009]";This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) awarded to the author.;;35;0;0;2;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1750-1229;1750-1237;;INNOV LANG LEARN TEA;Innov.

In addition to self-reported motivational variables, the study examined the intervention's impact on L2 production during teacher-student interactions. Two intact university-level classes were assigned to the experimental (n= 26) and control (n= 24) groups. The vision intervention focused on entrepreneurship to trigger and enhance vision of the business-major students and incorporated group work relating to future L2 use in the global market. The results show that the intervention positively affected theideal L2 selfandinternational posture,but theought-to L2 selfandintended effortwere not affected. Also, the experimental group increased target language use over time. The correlational analyses of the motivational and behavioral variables showed that only after the intervention was target language use positively correlated with the ideal L2 self, but negatively with the ought-to L2 self.

Lately, researchers have given increased attention to digital texts. Although progress on these topics has been made as reported in published research, there is yet incomplete information regarding readers' habits and opinions at university and professional levels. This study describes the self-reported habits of university students belonging to two disciplinary domains (Human Sciences and Economic and Business Sciences) regarding reading on paper or on digital media for three purposes: academic, entertainment, and information seeking. The results reveal that the readers' preferences vary according to the three purposes. These readers reported using different media but had a clear preference for paper; they also reported distinguishing between cognitive processes (memory, comprehension, and learning), with the discipline to which they belonged having no radical effect on their preferences. All of this leads us to conclude that currently there exists a generation in transition, a 'Gutenberg-Google' generation, which still recognizes the relevance of paper, in particular for academic purposes.";"[Parodi, Giovanni; Moreno-de Leon, Tomas] Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Julio, Cristobal] Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Linguist, Valparaiso, Chile; [Burdiles, Gina] Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Concepcion, Chile";;Parodi, G (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;"giovanni.parodi@pucv.cl; tomas.moreno.d@mail.pucv.cl; cristobal.julio@pucv.cl; gburdiles@ucsc.cl";"Julio, Cristóbal/P-7265-2019; Moreno-de León, Tomás/AAA-4036-2022";"Julio, Cristóbal/0000-0002-4723-0271; Moreno-de León, Tomás/0000-0003-4931-971X; Burdiles Fernandez, Gina/0000-0001-5164-8382";FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170623];Research Project FONDECYT 1170623 (2017-2020) Are there different routes for reading multi-semiotic texts in professionals of different disciplinary backgrounds: Philosophy and economics?

On a conceptual level, it outlines a model for understanding how TV operates as a social mediator in the event of natural disasters, and at the practical level, it recommends measures that can be used to optimize the role of TV and its ideal social function in contexts of crisis. This model views TV intervention as both self-centered, that is, driven by its reproduction as a media consumption company; and socially-centered, designed to respond swiftly and accurately to the social requirements that emerge in crisis situations. The suggested model is to be contrasted with the results of a research study conducted by the National TV Council of Chile that explored the role of TV broadcasting after the earthquake in February 2010. According to the results of the study, audiences value the amount of information broadcasted by TV networks but perceive that the predominance of its self-centered function creates a problem: the logic of the 'spectacle' is prevalent and exacerbates the audience's emotions. The primary purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy to recommend how TV and its associate services can respond to a crisis situation while respecting the tragedy of natural disasters.";"[Dolores Souza, Ma] Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile; [Dolores Souza, Ma] Programa Televis Educ Novasur Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Martinez, Victor] Univ Chile, Dept Psicol, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile";;Souza, MD (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile.;"msouza@cntv.cl; vimartin@vtr.net";;;;;;7;5;5;0;13;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2011;18;36;;;;;69;76;;10.3916/C36-2011-02-07;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";716RY;WOS:000286992400009;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

This study was undertaken with the aim of establishing whether this kind of exposure precludes the reutilization of questions in future years. In all, 197 questions were used more than once from 1994 to 1998. Considering the first and last time they were included in a test, 50 (25%) increased their difficulty, 39 (20%) diminished it, and 108 (55%) remained unchanged. The correlation coefficient between the percentage of students that answered correctly each question the first and last time they were used was 0.51 (p < 0.001). It is concluded that the kind of exposure students are given by our course to MCQs, seems not to preclude their future reutilization.;Univ Chile, Dept Pediat, Hosp Ninos Luis Calvo Mackenna, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile;;Herskovic, P (corresponding author), 8644 Principe Gales, Santiago 6871619, Chile.;herko@cmet.net;;;;;;4;1;1;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-159X;1466-187X;;MED TEACH;Med.

In particular, the previous literature has compared student effort under relative and absolute grading systems, but the results are mixed and the implications of the models have not been empirically tested. In this paper, I build a model where students maximize their utility by choosing effort. I investigate how student effort changes when there is a change in the grading system from absolute grading to relative grading. I use a unique dataset from college students in Chile who faced a change in the grading system to test the implications of my model. My model predicts that, for low levels of uncertainty, low-ability students exert less effort with absolute grading, and high-ability students exert more effort with absolute grading. The data confirm that there is a change in the distribution of effort.;[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile;;Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.;vparedes@fen.uchile.cl;;;"CEPPE, project Conicyt [CIE-01-4]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PAI 7912010032]";I would like to thank CEPPE, project CIE-01-4 Conicyt, for providing financial support.

J;Marini, G;;;;Marini, Guillermo;;;An Introduction to Everyday Aesthetics in Education;STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Sensory perception; Everyday aesthetics; School aesthetic matrixes; Space and place in school; Pedagogical experience";;The purpose of this paper is to introduce everyday aesthetics in education. First, it presents everyday aesthetics as a subdiscipline within philosophical aesthetics, that revisits sensory perception as the backdrop of all experience, claims ordinary life is a proper venue for aesthetic inquiry, and problematizes the impact aesthetic preferences have on habitual decisions. Second, the paper argues that among the diverse matters students learn in school, they learn-explicitly or implicitly-what and how to perceive, as well as the pedagogical purposes of daily perception. School models the relationships that students will develop between what they perceive, what they think about it, and how they act accordingly. Next, the paper elaborates on the notions of school aesthetic matrixes and space and place in school. School aesthetic matrixes refer to perceptual patterns that allow characterizing relationships between daily perception and the pedagogical project of a school. They manifest through expressions such asprison school,home school,mall school, etc. Space and place in school allude to concomitant experiences, of corporeal basis, that allow describing how we inhabit the world. What distinguishes them is the approach each one gives to the senses and the body. The paper concludes by calling attention to the comprehension and role of perception in education, urging to mind the aesthetic-pedagogical character that students develop throughout 12 years of schooling. Ultimately, the key relationships we develop with ourselves, others, and the world, entail a basic perceptual dimension that can be educated to become more purposefully and integrally present in life.;[Marini, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile;;Marini, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;gmarini@uc.cl;;Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151;Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT [1210808];This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT Regular 1210808.;;27;2;2;2;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0039-3746;1573-191X;;STUD PHILOS EDUC;Stud.

These are mostly conducted by Catholic teachers who form their own professional identity from internal demands (imposed by the Catholic Church) and external demands (imposed by the school culture, social media, students and their families). This paper presents a reference framework for the professional teacher identity and analyses the linguistic structures and persuasion strategies present in three documents that directly question this group of teachers, building an identity profile of them. Discursive mechanisms are identified which legitimise identity traits. The way in which said productions influence the thoughts and actions of their readership is also analysed. A documentary study design is used based on critical documentary analysis. The investigation shows breaks in the discourse and an existing tension between the mission and the profession, underlining that the Catholic religion teacher is first and foremost an evangeliser. The performance capacity of this discourse on the listeners is discussed along with the effect of the almost complete absence of references to teaching professionalism and the possible influence on the development and results of the subject.;"[Vargas-Herrera, Francisco; Moya-Marchant, Loreto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ecclesiast Theol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Vargas-Herrera, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile";;"Vargas-Herrera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ecclesiast Theol, Valparaiso, Chile.; Vargas-Herrera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile.";francisco.vargas@pucv.cl;"Vargas-Herrera, Francisco/L-8516-2018; Moya-Marchant, Loreto/Y-3997-2018";"Vargas-Herrera, Francisco/0000-0002-0718-6616; Moya-Marchant, Loreto/0000-0003-4123-579X";Stipendienwerk Lateinamerika-Deutschland (Icala, Consejo Valparaiso, Chile);This work was supported by Stipendienwerk Lateinamerika-Deutschland (Icala, Consejo Valparaiso, Chile).;;36;3;3;0;16;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0141-6200;1740-7931;;BRIT J RELIG EDUC;Brit.

Those students were being exposed to the same curricular experience, but they were in different stages of medical training by this time. At the moment of the study they were at the end of the first, third, fifth and seventh year of medical training. The assessment was done using the Lancaster Inventory of Learning Approach. It was answered by a total of 143 students (100%). The four groups showed very similar scores without significant differences between them. According to the final results the meaning orientation was predominant in all the groups. This orientation corresponded, to the deep approach to learning of Newble & Entwistle (1986).

J;Cardenas-Claros, MS;;;;Stella Cardenas-Claros, Monica;;;Spontaneous links between help option use and input features that hinder second language listening comprehension;SYSTEM;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Help options; Computer-based listening; Reflection; Input text characteristics";;As more second language (L2) learners autonomously attend to authentic online input, L2 researchers are examining the mediating role of technology in the listening process. This qualitative multiple-case study explored the links between spontaneous use of help options and identification of input text characteristics of dissemination talks. Working with authentic video clip segments in six individual sessions, 13 high-intermediate learners of English from Chile interacted with pre-, while-, and post-listening exercises hosted in a purpose-built listening environment that supports a range of help options. Data was collected through an entry-survey, task-directed listening questionnaires, screen capturing software, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the use of help options was instrumental for participants producing informed responses, and allowed for the identification of general lexis, technical vocabulary, and fast speech rate as comprehension-impeding characteristics of dissemination talks. In particular, transcripts were the most helpful ancillary element. The article presents pedagogical implications and discusses avenues for further research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Between 2002 and 2011 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1282 schools closed -roughly one-tenth of the current stock- and 2350 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which contains individual students' academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 49 and 68% (1.8 and 2.5 percentage points). Also, school exit implies between 3.9 and 4.4 percentage points increase in the probability of grade retention in fifth grade.;"[Grau, Nicolas; Hojman, Daniel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile";;"Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.; Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.";amizala@dii.uchile.cl;"Hojman, Daniel A/N-4178-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013";"Hojman, Daniel A/0000-0001-7768-0065; Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677";"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; PIA-CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003]";We thank the Chilean Ministry of Education for providing the data.

The classroom intervention was designed to promote collaborative learning and to train learners to provide CF to each other. Participants were university-level learners in 4 required English classes in Japan (N=167), each assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions. While all experimental classes were given peer interaction instruction, 2 classes were given CF training (prompts or recasts). Another class served as the control group. Questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention and selected learners (n=36) were interviewed. The quantitative (factor-analysis and matched-samples t-tests) and qualitative (grounded theory methodology) analyses revealed that, while learners held positive beliefs about peer interaction and peer CF from the onset, the intervention facilitated trust in their classmates as learning resources, and those who were given CF training displayed an increased willingness to and confidence in providing CF. Also, 2 classroom-specific variables emerged for the intervention to be effective on language development: a collaborative classroom environment and positive social relationships between learners.;Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile;;Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile.;masatoshi.sato@unab.cl;Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019;Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406;;;;116;53;53;10;115;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0026-7902;1540-4781;;MOD LANG J;Mod.

This article is based on a study designed to identify the relationship that exists between teaching styles and their varying effects on anxiety levels among non-native pre-service EFL teachers (NNPSETs). Teaching styles were identified according to the Grasha-Riechmann Teaching Style Survey (1996) while learner anxiety was measured through the Foreign Language Class Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986). Results suggest that certain teaching styles or style clusters seem to provoke more anxiety, especially when accompanied by other factors such as gender, grade point average and past performance. This article discusses the need for an increased awareness among teachers concerning LA and how particular teaching styles can either hinder or facilitate language learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J;"Cancino, M; Panes, J";;;;"Cancino, Marco; Panes, Jaime";;;The impact of Google Translate on L2 writing quality measures: Evidence from Chilean EFL high school learners;SYSTEM;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Online translators; Writing quality; EFL learning; Google translate; Linguistic complexity";"FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; MACHINE TRANSLATION; STUDENTS; ENGLISH; STRATEGIES; ACCURACY";Over the last 30 years, English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms have been consistently nurtured by technology. An important breakthrough in this respect has been Google Translate (GT), one of the most widely used online translators (OTs). Research suggests that when teachers are aware of the limitations of OTs and provide adequate guidance to use them, they can become effective pedagogical devices. However, most of the studies conducted in EFL settings focus on adult learners' perceptions toward OTs or rely on holistic rubrics to assess writing quality. Thus, the present study sought to apply a linguistic approach to the analysis of writing output produced by high school learners using GT. Sixty-one high-school EFL learners were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (GT without instruction, GT with instruction, and a group with no access to GT). Writing quality was assessed in terms of T-unit length, syntactic complexity, and accuracy in a narrative task. Results suggest that syntactic complexity and accuracy scores were higher in the groups that had access to GT. The possibilities for GT as an effective learning tool are discussed, while emphasizing the need for learners to receive adequate instruction on how to utilize it. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to analyze the factors associated with postretirement work in Chile, a country characterized by a strong persistence of a male-breadwinner model endorsed by deeply-rooted traditional gender roles, and at the same time characterized by a dual-earner model strongly encouraged by a neoliberal system. Relying on a gendered life course perspective and using a nationally representative survey, we conducted logistic regression analyses to explore how a number of cumulative advantages and disadvantages (such as work trajectory, job satisfaction, and caregiving duties) shape working beyond legal retirement age and the intrinsic motivation to continue working among economically active older adults in Chile. One of the main findings of the present study is that intrinsic motivation to continue working was a remarkably significant predictor of postretirement work among older Chilean adults, especially among women. The results also suggest that even though older women are motivated to continue working, the national labor market is unlikely to offer such possibility. The findings of this study have implications for practice in the sense that they demonstrate the imperative need for organizations to focus on intrinsic motivation-related factors in striving to improve employees' willingness to stay within the company after the state pension age.;"[Galkute, Milda; Herrera, M.

The objective was also to determine whether there are differential profiles in the use and consumption of media related to the future role of these profiles in the audiovisual literacy of the students. To do this, a non-random sample was used comprising 881 Pedagogy students of both genders studying at seven universities in southern and central Chile. The media consumption questionnaire was used for data collection. In general, the distribution of preferences by gender and degree course falls short of representing idiosyncrasy in terms of the media, and reflects outside realities that do not permit participation in citizenry processes to be strengthened in media consumers. In short, the biggest problem is that future teachers do not seem to have the tools that allow them to manage the work of audiovisual literacy since they themselves have difficulties in differentiating between information and persuasion in advertising messages.;"[del Valle, Carlos] Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Languages Literature & Commun, Temuco, Chile; [Denegri, Marianela] Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Psychol, Fac Educ Social Sci & Humanities, Temuco, Chile";;del Valle, C (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Languages Literature & Commun, Temuco, Chile.;"delvalle@ufro.cl; mdenegri@ufro.cl; d.chavez02@ufromail.cl";"LI, Yun-lu/AAO-3325-2020; Chávez, David/AAT-4412-2020; Denegri, Marianela/AAU-9898-2021";"Chávez, David/0000-0003-4700-0588; ";;;;49;5;5;2;36;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2012;19;38;;;;;183;191;;10.3916/C38-2012-03-10;;;9;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";895MX;WOS:000300501400022;;Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Forty-four Grade 3 students (8-9 years old) from two intact classes participated in the study. The learners in Class A (n = 23) engaged in a series of activities designed to increase their metacognition in relation to WTC, while Class B (n = 21) served as the control. Three outcome measures were explored in the pre-post design: (1) WTC questionnaire; (2) second language (L2) production during group work; and (3) empty WTC pyramids that the participants drew before and after the intervention. In addition, post-intervention interviews were conducted to understand the learners' metacognitive knowledge of oral communication. The results showed that the intervention did not have an observable impact on the learners' WTC. However, their metacognitive knowledge of oral communication was heightened after the intervention. The behavioral data showed that the experimental participants produced the target language more and that group members started to share turns more evenly.

This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission rules that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu's conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families' advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes.;"[Carrasco, Alejandro; Hernandez, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Honey, Ngaire; Oyarzun, Juan de Dios] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;ajcarras@uc.cl;;Oyarzun, Juan de Dios/0000-0002-8168-076X;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile, ANID PIA [CIE160007];This article was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile, ANID PIA CIE160007.;;47;3;3;6;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-5692;1465-3346;;BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC;Br.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of students and personnel at a Chilean dental school during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods This phenomenological descriptive qualitative study reported staff and students' experiences during the pandemic through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. These were recorded on audio and video with a digital platform. Three researchers then transcribed and analyzed the recordings and codified the answers into categories to determine the emerging topics until a saturation point was reached. Results The core emerging themes among the staff group were (1) change in the personal/professional life balance, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) staff perceptions of students' learning experiences, and (4) concerns about the future. For students, the themes were (1) changes in the learning process, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) interpersonal relationships, and (4) concerns about the future. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of learning for our dental school staff and students. Even though online learning has been a useful tool for delivering didactic (theoretical) concepts, it has been unable to replace conventional education, including skills training. Students and teachers reported being overwhelmed at the beginning of the pandemic, but they have shown remarkable adaptability and resilience during this period.;"[Prieto, Diego; Tricio, Jorge; Caceres, Felipe; Param, Fernanda; Melendez, Catalina; Vasquez, Pamela; Prada, Pamela] Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Av Mons Alvaro Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile";;Prieto, D (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Av Mons Alvaro Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile.;djprieto@mluandes.cl;"Prieto, Diego/AAJ-4600-2021; Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013";"Prieto, Diego/0000-0002-3691-0212; Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828; Caceres, Felipe/0000-0003-1276-8212; VASQUEZ, PAMELA/0000-0003-0573-2975";;;;17;3;3;4;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1396-5883;1600-0579;;EUR J DENT EDUC;Eur.

We present qualitative empirical evidence on the use of mass media and digital technologies from the digital convergence of media, the industry and the resulting complementary formats. Television, in particular, has experienced a process of changing its formats and expressive content by delivering interactivity, facilitating the expression of subjects by means of different technological devices. So from the perspective of the subject, it is observed that the new technological devices and their new grammars are utilized provided they contribute with meaning to his daily practice and biographical trajectory. Nevertheless, digital inclusion policies have focused only on maximizing access to equipment and digital literacy associated to technology applications and not to the narrative skills of the subjects. It is therefore necessary to generate new concepts that allow new methodological guidelines, in communication and education academic processes, to promote the use of new emerging digital spaces for communicational empowered citizens, that is, from competent to tell (expressive skills) to more specifically, tell oneself (as an individual) and tell us (collectively). Finally, these will be the expressive spaces of the new television with citizen's expressions, fostered by converging elements of digital technology.;"[Phillippi, Alejandra; Avendano, Claudio] Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Escuela Periodismo, Santiago, Chile";;Phillippi, A (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Escuela Periodismo, Santiago, Chile.;"alejandra.phillippi@udp.cl; claudio.avendano@udp.cl";Phillippi, Alejandra/AAB-6164-2022;;;;;27;9;9;0;16;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2011;18;36;;;;;61;68;;10.3916/C36-2011-02-06;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";716RY;WOS:000286992400008;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2022-04-06;

A report from a Latin American panel based on a qualitative approach;MEDICAL TEACHER;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"HEALTH; INEQUALITIES";Background: Latin America is a region with huge health inequalities and a tremendous growth in the number of medical schools during the last decades. The role of the medical schools in reducing health inequality has not been systematically explored.Methods: A qualitative framework method was used to explore the meaning, barriers, and facilitators of the concept of the social accountability of medical schools in Latin America. Twenty nine Latin American academic leaders from seven countries participated in an expert panel discussion. The Atlas ti.7 software was used to analyze the information.Results: Social accountability was identified as a core dimension of the mission of medical schools. The panel identified a gradient of three dimensions associated with social accountability. First, a formative dimension related to student selection, curricular structure and community based learning initiatives. Second, a societal dimension associated with institutional mission, community partnerships, and social research projects. Third, a political dimension related with involvement in health policies and primary care engagement. Lack of accreditation standards was identified as a main barrier to improve social accountability.Conclusions: Latin American leaders consider that medical schools should develop specific formative, societal, and political initiatives in order to be socially accountable.;"[Puschel, Klaus; Riquelme, Arnoldo; Moore, Philippa; Rojas, Viviana; Perry, Andres; Sapag, Jaime C.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile";;"Sapag, JC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago 8330077, Chile.; Sapag, JC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago 8330077, Chile.";jsapag@med.puc.cl;;;School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile;This work was supported by School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.;;25;5;5;0;9;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0142-159X;1466-187X;;MED TEACH;Med.

To this end, the concepts of the doctor-patient relationship and doctor-patient communication are revisited to explore their therapeutic dimensions. The concept of TP is defined, and existing literature about the relationship between that concept, the therapeutic alliance, and mindfulness is reviewed, alongside an examination of related concepts that have developed within nursing and medicine. We conclude that TP emerges as a transtheoretical concept that can be integrated into our understanding of the doctor-patient encounter to improve both doctor-patient communication and the doctor-patient relationship. The way in which the biomedical model may limit a present medicine is discussed, and the means of integrating such a model of doctor-patient encounter into medical training and practice is analyzed.;"[Krogh, Edwin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Krogh, Edwin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Psychodynam Psychotherapy, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro; Schmidt, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Valdivia, Chile; [Schmidt, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Clin Psychol, Valdivia, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Funct Anal Clin & Hlth Contexts, Valdivia, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Millennium Inst Res Depress & Personal MIDAP, Santiago, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies Nervous Syst CISNe, Valdivia, Chile";;"Krogh, E (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.; Krogh, E (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Psychodynam Psychotherapy, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.";edwin.krogh@uach.cl;Hubsher, Marshall/Q-1825-2019;"Hubsher, Marshall/0000-0002-9775-0400; Hubsher, Marshall/0000-0002-7315-8947; Krogh, Edwin/0000-0002-2042-3137";Innovation and Competitiveness (FIC) of the Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, through the Millennium Scientific Initiative [IS130005];A.L. is partially supported for Innovation and Competitiveness (FIC) of the Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, through the Millennium Scientific Initiative, Grant No. IS130005.;;60;4;4;17;111;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0894-1912;1554-558X;;J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH;J.

Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing non-explicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization No+APF. From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students. 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headiness and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media's brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization No+APF. The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between critical-thinking abilities and having a defined opinion.;"[Vernier, Matthieu; Scheihing, Eliana] Univ Austral Chile Valdivia, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile; [Carcamo, Luis] Univ Chile Valdivia, Inst Comunicac Social, Valdivia, Chile";;Vernier, M (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile Valdivia, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile.;"mvernier@inf.uach.cl; lcarcamo@uach.cl; escheihi@inf.uach.cl";"Carcamo-Ulloa, Luis/L-5545-2019; Vernier, Matthieu/W-9620-2019; Ulloa, Luis/AAE-8751-2019; Cárcamo-Ulloa, Luis/ABF-6797-2020";"Vernier, Matthieu/0000-0002-3265-4709; Ulloa, Luis/0000-0002-7702-7549; Cárcamo-Ulloa, Luis/0000-0003-0633-9606; Scheihing, Eliana/0000-0003-1801-9167";;;;35;8;9;3;24;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN 1;2018;26;54;;;;;101;110;;10.3916/C54-2018-10;;;10;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";FS2GD;WOS:000419595900005;;Green Accepted, gold, Green Published, Green Submitted;;;2022-04-06;

However, the physical presence of the subjects and the body remain something primordial and irreplaceable in traditional educational processes. Thus, it is often assumed that virtuality is opposed to the corporeal reality of the subjects involved in teaching, learning and studying. In this paper we aim to critically challenge this assumption by addressing the phenomenon of virtuality in a more original sense: as a fundamental dimension of corporeality itself. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological insights, we argue that the experience of the virtual is inherently embodied and fully real. We understand corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena. At the same time, this leads us to rethink the digital as only one possible medium in which virtuality can appear as inherent to embodied experience. We develop our phenomenological approach in three instances. First, we question and bracket two common assumptions about corporeality. From our critical perspective, assumptions about a disembodied digitality and a devirtualized corporeality represent extremes within which educational discourses currently move. Second, we address the inherent virtuality of embodied experience. We outline the heuristic concept of the virtual body (Merleau-Ponty) to describe corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena that encompass extension, intercorporeality and intermediality. Finally, we make some remarks on the relationships of corporeality and virtuality considering the challenges of digital education.;"[Willatt, Carlos; Manuel Flores, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Theory & Policy, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile";;Willatt, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Theory & Policy, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile.;cjwillat@uc.cl;;Willatt, Carlos/0000-0003-3357-5073;Chilean National Agency for Research and Development [3200018];This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT Postdoctoral 3200018.;;73;0;0;5;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0039-3746;1573-191X;;STUD PHILOS EDUC;Stud.

The use of this tool has benefits for both the producer of the movie, as well as for brands and/or products. There is currently no consensus in the academic world on how to measure the effectiveness of this communication tool. There is scarce scientific evidence in Latin America, and in Chile this format has been used in television programs, and only recently in movies. The objective of this research is to study the influence of placement in movies on explicit memory (unaided recall and brand awareness) and implicit memory (purchase intention) through the implementation of an experiment performed on a sample of 205 Chilean college students, according to the different types of placement in movies: brands as part of the background, used by a main character, and connected with the plot. The results indicate that the higher the degree of integration of the brand with the plot of the film, the higher the probability of stimulating the explicit memory of participants and thereby unaided recall and brand awareness, providing empirical evidence regarding the learning of consumer behavior through placement as a communication tool.;"[Valenzuela-Fernandez, Leslier; Martinez-Troncoso, Carolina; Yanez-Wieland, Felipe] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile";;Valenzuela-Fernandez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.;"lvalenzuela@unegocios.cl; cmartinezt@uft.cl; fyanezw@fen.uchile.cl";;Martinez Troncoso, Carolina Andrea/0000-0001-8467-4317;;;;39;7;7;1;19;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;JAN 1;2015;22;44;;;;;169;176;;10.3916/C44-2015-18;;;8;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";AX8KR;WOS:000347158900018;;Green Accepted, gold;;;2022-04-06;

Given the importance of coping to optimal mental health, healthy ways of coping with losses related to the aging process are identified and characterized. Thirty-six semistructured in-depth interviews were carried out with adults aged 65 years and older in order to understand experiences that they assessed as losses associated with aging. Their ways of coping and their levels of subjective well-being were documented. The qualitative analysis yielded was complemented by quantitative analysis. Six types of losses were identified: health and/or physical capacity, quality of emotional relationships, death of loved ones, social integration, quality of life in a material sense, and quality of life in a cognitive sense. As determined by both the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the way of coping most strongly linked with high levels of subjective well-being was that of accommodation, followed by different ways of coping consistent with each type of loss. Healthy ways of coping are essential to maintaining subjective well-being in old age, with the most effective being identified. The mode of observation employed may be applied and improved in future research studies.

They also suggest that parents largely ignore the results of standardized tests. We use a novel data-set which includes precise measures of the distance between homes and schools to analyze the determinants of school choice in Chile. Economic theory suggests, and the estimations confirm, that parents consider quality and the location when choosing schools. The paper quantifies the relevant trade-offs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, the discussion concerning local culture and ELT materials has not yet reached textbooks designed for children in their first years of English language learning. This study aims to explore whether the ELT materials used in the first two years of compulsory English language education in Chile, 5th- and 6th- grades, include representations of the local culture, and whether these materials are being localised by the teachers. Through a content analysis of a corpus of four ELT materials approved and distributed in public schools from 2013 to 2016 and from 2017 to 2019 and the examination of 63 teachers' perceptions on localisation of ELT coursebooks, the article argues that the ELT materials analysed include representations of local culture specifically associated with 'national geography' and 'stereotypes and national identity'. Although teachers reported that they were unsure about whether the cultural representations of the materials facilitated learning, they claimed to include representations of local references when adapting the textbooks. The article concludes by suggesting that the ELT materials locally produced demand urgent review. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J;Herskovic, L;;;;Herskovic, Luis;;;The Effect of Subway Access on School Choice;ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"TRANSIT; IMPACT";One of the goals of school choice is to allow parents to send their children to higher-performing schools. Several studies have shown that distance to school is one of the main determinants of school choice, but challenges to address endogeneity issues remain. To address these concerns, in this paper I take advantage of the construction of a new subway line in Santiago, Chile, that crosses a large area of the city previously unconnected to the subway network. I provide convincing evidence to show that the introduction of the subway line was arguably exogenous for families living close to the new subway stations. With rich administrative data, which includes all high-school seniors that registered to take a national university entrance exam, I use a repeated cross-section difference-in-differences analysis and find that (i) students near the new subway stations travel significantly farther to school than students who live in nearby areas with no subway stations, and (ii) that students near the subway are willing to travel slightly farther to attend schools that perform better in standardized tests, although this effect is small and only significant for language test scores. This set of results is particularly informative in the context of the broader school-choice debate, contributing causal evidence on the effects of transit access on school-choice.;[Herskovic, Luis] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile;;Herskovic, L (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.;luis.herskovic@uai.cl;;Herskovic, Luis/0000-0002-8761-1669;Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [ANID/FONDAP/15130009];I am very grateful to Ofer Malamud, Anjali Adukia and Dan Black for all their comments and suggestions.

However, the digital revolution has transformed the ways to encourage reading and learning about books. People who generate and share content about books on social networks are the so-called booktokers, influencers on TikTok who have become an emerging phenomenon in this connected society. However, there is scarce research that studies them in depth. Therefore, it is crucial to explore booktokers to understand them better and to assess why they accept and use technologies to generate and share content about books on TikTok. This paper intends to explore the acceptance and use of TikTok to generate and share content about books on this social network as a booktoker. For this, a qualitative methodology of semi-structured interviews with thirteen Latin American booktokers was used. The analysis was developed through a thematic analysis based on the UTAUT2 theory to explain the findings. The results indicated the categories: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, price value, and a new identified category related to the generation of community and networks. This study constitutes one of the pioneering works in the exploration of the booktoker phenomenon.;"[Guinez-Cabrera, Nataly; Mansilla-Obando, Katherine] Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile";;Guinez-Cabrera, N (corresponding author), Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.;;;Mansilla Obando, Katherine/0000-0003-4273-4259;;;;46;0;0;15;15;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;APR;2022;30;71;;;;;;;;10.3916/C71-2022-09;;;12;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";YO1WE;WOS:000747736200009;;Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted;;;2022-04-06;

However, there are social, contextual and individual variables that influence students' decisions to speak up or remain silent when the situation calls for spoken participation in class. This mixed-methods study investigates L2 use and classroom participation practices of German-as-foreign-language learners; their predictions and expectations regarding their own participation during the foreign language class; and the reasons behind their actions according to their own accounts. Students answered an in-class survey administered at different points during four lessons sampled throughout an academic semester. Using stimulated recall interviews, focal participants were asked to explain their reasoning for speaking or remaining silent at specific moments in the class meetings. Findings revealed a link between predicted and self-reported participation that developed progressively as a result of a combination of factors, such as alignment with classroom norms, the teachers expectations, students-speaking goals, and motivation among others. These findings provide a new understanding of WTC and bear pedagogical implications for teaching. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the underlying mechanisms that explain this effect have not been empirically explored. This paper studies the impact of same gender teachers on academic achievement for a large sample of 8th graders in Chile. I provide evidence that girls benefit from being assigned to female teachers, while there is no negative effect on boys. More importantly, I provide evidence that the positive effect is due to role model effects and not to teacher bias effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the time and dedication of planning a lesson and its importance in the teaching and learning process, understanding and acknowledging teachers' cognition while planning at different stages of their careers is needed. The objective of this study was to examine in-service and pre-service teachers' cognitive processes while lesson planning with the use of the think-aloud protocol. Frequency and content analysis were used as data analysis techniques. A total of 28 English teachers and 86 student teachers had to plan a lesson verbalizing their thoughts while being recorded. After this task was fulfilled, the recordings were transcribed and the transcripts analyzed and coded. This data was later organized into categories and subcategories, and counted to analyze how often various cognitive processes appeared. The findings show that while both groups of participants (in-service and pre-service teachers) displayed a wide range of cognitive processes while planning, pre-service teachers were more likely to plan every aspect of the class in detail. However, in-service teachers were more concise at the moment of planning. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This discussion seeks to complement the functionalist perspective of communication studies in the field of advertising content analysis by incorporating a discursive focus, taking into account contextual issues that may condition the interpretation of messages. Firstly, discourse analysis was used as a means of exploring social representations, identifying stereotypes employed in children's advertising in order to establish the possible functions of the message. To contrast these findings, group interviews were conducted with 10 and 11 year-old boys and girls from middle-income families in Santiago, Chile. A comparison of both findings reveals a complex and relational notion of childhood. Children see themselves as burdened by parents, and adulthood as an effective lack of liberty, where the archetypes reveal an image of the adult world as a state of loss with respect to the exercise of creativity, imagination and freedom. These archetypes correlate to children's television output, where a number of shows ridicule the image of adults through irony and parody, presenting them as incompetent in their roles as parents and in their moral authority.;"[Vergara, Enrique] Diego Portales Univ, Commun & Arts Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Ana] Diego Portales Univ, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile";;Vergara, E (corresponding author), Diego Portales Univ, Commun & Arts Fac, Santiago, Chile.;"enrique.vergara@udp.cl; ana.vergara@udp.cl";;vergara del solar, ana cecilia/0000-0001-7823-3769;;;;32;7;7;0;16;GRUPO COMUNICAR;HUELVA;APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN;1134-3478;1988-3293;;COMUNICAR;Comunicar;MAR 1;2012;19;38;;;;;167;173;;10.3916/C38-2012-03-08;;;7;"Communication; Education & Educational Research";Social Science Citation Index (SSCI);"Communication; Education & Educational Research";895MX;WOS:000300501400020;;gold;;;2022-04-06;

In 2011, Chile experienced massive mobilizations for seven months. These were perhaps the most important social protests in Chile's recent history, where young people played a leading role in the discussion over education. During these events, Facebook was one of the digital social networks most widely used by the mobilized organizations. In FECH's case, it utilized Facebook mainly to call for protest actions, to highlight the achievements of the movement, and to indicate their opponents. However, most of the content published on this Facebook page was produced by traditional media, showing that conventional communication strategies of social movements are interrelated with new innovative practices.

The study was underpinned by an appraisal of the effects of the visual on students' lives and the importance for them to critically navigate these experiences. Aotearoa New Zealand's bicultural educational policies - based on Maori and European views - and flexible curriculum emerged as a rich conceptual vantage point from which to examine critical thinking.

Evidence from GPA-based university admission in Chile;ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;"College admissions; Rankings; Incentives; Moral hazard";AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION;"The use of students' within-school grade point average (GPA) ranking has emerged as a means to increase admission rates of both segregated minorities and high-performance individuals. Based on that idea, Chile's centralized university admission system introduced, in 2012, a GPA-ranking score variable. In contrast to other ranking-based criteria, the Chilean version ostensibly avoids classmate competition by basing scores on past cohorts' GPAs. Also, the GPA-ranking is similar to an added bonus to the GPA score, and it does not replace the national admission exam. Such design incentivizes both academic effort and GPA inflation. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the Chilean reform on GPA and achievement. Our results, based on difference-in-differences and simulated instruments methods, suggest that: (i) GPA increased across the entire distribution of students; (ii) GPA increases were larger in schools where the new variable presented greater incentives; and (iii) GPA increases were unrelated to improvements in achievement. We interpret the results as evidence that the Chilean ranking variable caused GPA inflation rather than increased learning.";"[Fajnzylber, Eduardo; Leon, Tomas] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile";;Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile.;"eduardo.fajnzylber@uai.cl; blara@utalca.cl";;Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741;;;;16;3;3;2;9;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0272-7757;1873-7382;;ECON EDUC REV;Econ.

I build a rank-order tournament model where high school students decide their level of effort and whether or not to take the college admissions test, considering how those decisions affect their future university admissions chances. Using administrative Chilean data for the 2009 college admissions process, I structurally estimate the parameters of the model. Two affirmative action policies are simulated: (a) SES-quota system, which imposes the population's socioeconomic group (SES) distribution for each university; (b) increasing the weight of high school GPA in the admission final score. These simulations support the claim that affirmative action in college admission may boost the amount of academic effort exerted by high school students. I also find that while increasing the weight of high school GPA is more effective in boosting students' academic effort in high school, the SES-quota system is more efficient in allocating the best students to the best universities.";[Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile;;Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile.;ngrau@fen.uchile.cl;;;Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009];I thank Diego Amador, Sina Ates, Garth Baughman, Flavio Cunha, Hanming Fang, Tzuo Hann Law, Andres Hojman, Daniel Hojman, Zehao Hu, Tomas Rau, Minchul Shin, Petra Todd, Juan Pablo Torres-Martinez and Kenneth I.

We carried out an experiment with university students to determine if this HLT contributed to the expected learning of these concepts. We contrast this HLT with the actual learning trajectory (ALT) of two students showing approximation to key phases of the designed HLT. The results show that the notion of set is useful for the construction of the concept of span.

International scholarship has emphasized the unequal conditions for minority groups to access higher education, but attention also needs to be given to the ways students forge new identity pathways for themselves within these racialized environments. Our analysis utilizes LatCrit studies to emphasize how marginal and hybrid identities enable forms of resistance and counter-narratives to dominant (white) ideologies and assimilatory practices. We focus on the concept of community cultural wealth and the empowerment that aspirational and resistant capital can give to Indigenous youth, providing alternative motives for their studies in relation to the Indigenous communities to which they belong.

His appearance was that of a normal person but variations in light greatly influenced his vision. During his first two years at a university in Australia, Tom had particular difficulty making sense of assessment and feedback. His perceptions, struggles and strategies are presented here as a narrative, primarily in his own words. Tom's interactions with academics were strong contributors to his mostly negative perceptions about assessment and feedback. Key influencers were his cultural background, his approach to feedback, and his own expectations of the role feedback should play. An analysis of four in-depth interviews and a written response of this student's attitudes, needs and issues demonstrate how academics, university stakeholders and experts in assessment and feedback can develop a raised awareness of, and sensitivity to, specialised ways of assisting international students with disabilities. A greater exploration and unpacking of these students' individual needs and difficulties is suggested in the process of understanding feedback and assessment in a new academic context.;"[Olave-Encina, Karen] Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Olave-Encina, Karen] Univ Amer, Fac Educ, Vina Del Mar, Chile";;Olave-Encina, K (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;karen.olave@uqconnect.edu.au;Olave-Encina, Karen/A-9739-2019;Olave-Encina, Karen/0000-0002-7596-6091;School of Education at The University of Queensland;Dr Karen Olave-Encina holds a fellowship in the School of Education at The University of Queensland and is also working as a casual lecturer in the School of Languages and Cultures at the same university.

Most of the prior literature on peer effects focuses on the characteristics of peers rather than examining the structure of peer networks. We attempt to measure not only the impact of peers but also the structure of the peer network. In particular we are interested in the characteristics of students' study groups along several dimensions: quality, heterogeneity, size and cohesion. Using pre-college characteristics of students and a random assignment into sections in their first year, we construct instruments of the study group measures to control for endogeneity of the network formation. Our OLS and IV estimates suggest that peer quality improves student performance, and that the breadth and cohesion of students' network positively affects student outcomes. We also find significant heterogeneity of the results depending on network characteristics.

Purpose: This study investigated the perceptions and experiences of some student teachers and their supervisors who used a video application during one practicum period. Student teachers recorded each other's lessons with the video app, and supervisors oversaw student teachers online, via a portal. The study aimed to explore how far the app constituted a useful tool for student teachers' professional development and for the supervision of student teachers' practice. Sample, design and method: The data were collected by gathering the experiences of 12 student teachers and 9 supervisors. Data included focus groups, interviews and video diaries. Analysis was undertaken using principles of content analysis and phenomenographic analysis such as thematising, coding and categorising. Results: Findings suggested that student teachers in general felt that the video app supported their self-reflection. The influence on their professional development may have been limited by factors including lack of guidance for individual and collaborative reflection. Using the video app as a supervisory tool was regarded as challenging in some ways, particularly because video clips taken out of context were unable to capture the classroom's atmosphere, environment and culture. Conclusions: The study highlights that video excerpts in themselves do not provide a sufficient basis for lesson observation. However, the study's results draw attention to the app's potential for guiding individual and collaborative video-based reflection. Consideration should be given to the changes that video-elicited reflection encourages with respect to supervision and its effects on the roles of supervisor and student teacher.;"[Korkko, Minna; Kyro-Ammala, Outi] Univ Lapland, Fac Educ, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Morales Rios, Sandra] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Korkko, M (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Fac Educ, Rovaniemi, Finland.;minna.korkko@ulapland.fi;;Korkko, Minna/0000-0002-4248-1434;European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [2015-1-UK01-KA201-013414];This work was supported by the European Commission under Grant 2015-1-UK01-KA201-013414.;;27;6;6;1;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0013-1881;1469-5847;;EDUC RES-UK;Educ.

However, the interaction between the levels has not been elaborated. Furthermore, it is known that people may draw either from intrinsic or extrinsic experiences to construct their identities depending on their cultural environment. Thus, affective individual and interindividual levels seem to interact with culture. In this study we focus on the significance of and the interaction between the individual and the interindividual levels of affect. This is done with respect to 2 different types of countries (Finland and Chile) to include cultural effect. We use questionnaire-based data and pupils' drawings of their mathematics class to find out about their individual and interindividual experiences. By using mixed data, we are not only getting a wider picture of pupils' affect but we can also avoid the most typical errors made in the cross-cultural comparisons as the pupils' own voice is strengthened. The main finding in the study is that the 2 affective levels are not congruent and that the incongruence appears differently in different types of cultures.;"[Tuohilampi, Laura; Laine, Anu; Hannula, Markku S.] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Varas, Leonor] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Tuohilampi, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.;"laura.tuohilampi@helsinki.fi; anu.laine@helsinki.fi; markku.hannula@helsinki.fi; mlvaras@dim.uchile.cl";"Hannula, Markku/AAF-6362-2020; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Laine, Anu/AAE-7083-2020";"Laine, Anu/0000-0003-3881-8134; Hannula, Markku/0000-0003-4979-7711; Tuohilampi, Laura/0000-0002-8117-4269";;;;41;3;3;0;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the functioning and effect of the SINs strategy as perceived by principals and curriculum coordinators across the country. Design/methodology/approach An adapted version of the Educational Collaborative Network Questionnaire was applied to a sample of 1,723 participants from 1,375 schools distributed in 398 networks. Descriptive, factor and sub-group statistical analyses by school performance categories and by different roles within these schools and networks are presented. Findings Results indicate that school leaders perceive SINs as an opportunity to work effectively in shared projects that can later be implemented in their own schools. Participants indicate that they can share knowledge in their networks and use it to solve problems in their own schools, which is especially relevant for secondary school leaders who work in difficult circumstances. Results suggest that it is important to facilitate greater autonomy for school leaders in their networks, especially regarding decision making about network goals and activities that are more significant to their contexts. Originality/value This is a national study of a recent school improvement strategy, which provides evidence, from the perspective of school leaders, of its strengths and improvement areas. This study shows that despite being in a competitive context, principals and curriculum coordinators value the opportunities to learn from and with others. These results can be of value for other contexts attempting to promote school networks as a means for school and system improvement.;"[Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Lideres Educ, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez Parrao, Constanza] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Leadership Ctr Sch Improvement, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile";;Pino-Yancovic, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Lideres Educ, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile.;"mauricio.pino@pucv.cl; c.gonzalez.14@ucl.ac.uk; luis.ahumada@pucv.cl; alvaro.gonzalez@pucv.cl";González, Álvaro/ABA-3272-2021;"González, Álvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio/0000-0002-4340-7519";;;;53;3;3;0;8;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0957-8234;1758-7395;;J EDUC ADMIN;J.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate advice-seeking patterns around the issue of supporting the learning and wellbeing of vulnerable students, among professional staff in six English secondary schools. The paper focuses on investigating variation in advice-seeking patterns among schools, exploring the association between these patterns and staff perceptions of the school climate for collaboration, and examining how these informal advice-seeking patterns relate to formal support arrangements in the schools. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach that combined findings from social network analysis with in-depth interviews was used. Findings It was found that advice-seeking patterns among staff vary substantively, even among similar schools. Furthermore, schools with more cohesive and reciprocal advice networks also showed a stronger climate for collaboration (i.e. mutual respect and distributed leadership). Also, formal organizational structures and informal advice-seeking structures showed coherence in the sample, as formally designated leaders, such as the Headteacher and the Special Educational Needs Coordinators, were generally highly central to their schools' advice network. Originality/value This study advances the field as there is little research that examines the social networks of educators in England, and no previous studies that explore teacher advice-seeking networks in relation to supporting vulnerable students, internationally.;"[Ortega, Lorena] Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Thompson, Ian; Daniels, Harry] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England";;Ortega, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.;lorena.ortega@ciae.uchile.cl;Ortega, Lorena/P-1879-2018;Ortega, Lorena/0000-0002-6471-0277;"Oxford University John Fell Research Fund [EPD07450]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]";This work was funded by Oxford University John Fell Research Fund EPD07450.

We identify assets that the students brought to their work-assets that can remain invisible and underused in modal classrooms-as well as the work the teacher did to support these SLPs through cueing, modeling, scaffolding, providing feedback, and defining the practice. We found that as the teacher taught these SLPs, she attended to individual student understandings, grounded the work in the subject-matter domain, and was equitable and ambitious in her instruction.

A total of 123 Chilean secondary students (52 girls and 71 boys; 13.5 +/- 0.7 years old) participated in this study. Physical activity was registered by GT3X accelerometers during an entire week. Results showed that there was a significant increase in the proportion of adolescents achieving the daily recommendation of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on physical education days (23.6%) than on non-physical education days (14.6%) (p <= 0.05). Boys and older adolescents presented statistically higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on physical education days than on non-physical education days. No differences were found in weight status comparison. Physical education has been found to be a crucial element in achieving the daily recommendations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

Research shows that service-learning has positive effects on the professional and personal development of future teachers. Since future teachers, in turn, influence the education of the next generation, it is important to understand how service-learning may influence the life purposes of student-teachers themselves, specifically, how emotions influence this development process. Statistical analyses of 198 Madrileno student-teachers' responses to online questionnaires suggested that service-learning involves positive emotions like interest, enthusiasm, inspiration and determination. Surprisingly, these positive emotions decrease during service, except for the 53 student-teachers whose purposes changed. Most reported positive changes in all dimensions of life purpose, with some also noting strengthened relationships between 10 pairs of dimensions, such as between stronger impetus to help others and a clearer understanding of who would benefit.

The results show a greater convergence of the teachers' and school principals' views regarding the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, with more divergence when it comes to the implementation process. More specifically, these differences were related to two points: (1) how appropriate the conditions were for using and learning how to use the new resources within the context of the school, and (2) who should be held accountable for integrating ICT resources within the school organization. Furthermore, the qualitative results revealed that school principals only had vague information on the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools.

We examine the extent to which teacher perceptions of school cohesion and intrinsic motivators stemming from two theoretical traditions contribute to the intent to leave one's school. We find that elementary teachers report higher levels of organizational cohesion within their schools along with stronger intrinsic motivation compared with peers teaching at the high school level, drawing on data from 548 teachers in Los Angeles schools. Teacher perceptions of school cohesion are moderately correlated with intrinsic motivators. However, views of strong leadership and teacher cohesion, not one's own intrinsic motivation, more strongly predict the likelihood of remaining at one's school, based on structural equation estimation with IRT-adjusted measurement models. We discuss implications for shaping interventions to strengthen the social cohesion of schools rather than simply rewarding individual teachers.;"[Fuller, Bruce] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Waite, Anisah] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Irribarra, David Torres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, MIDE, Santiago, Chile";;Fuller, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;;;;Spencer Foundation;We thank Justo Avila and Paul Miller for their steady leadership of this project, along with Cynthia Lim and her research staff, at the Los Angeles Unified School District.

This article describes and analyzes the last twenty years of education policies implemented to support the kinds of schools that welcome underachieving children from vulnerable sectors. The targeted programmes implemented between 1990 and 2007 included the Programme for Improving the Quality of Primary Schools in Poor Areas (P900), the Programme for Improving the Quality of Rural Education (PRural), the Intercultural Bilingual Programme, the Critical Schools Programme and the Priority Schools Programme. Analysis highlights the programmes' limitations (traceable to their failure to consider non-academic factors) and stresses the need to assimilate a pro-fairness education policy that includes positive discrimination. A study and critical analysis of current education policy, the School Grant Preference (SEP) Law, is the focus of the second part of the paper. The conclusion is that there is a need to continue implementing targeted compensatory policies and actions framed within broader strategies that take on the comprehensive formation of individuals in relation to their context, history, community and culture, policies for democratic citizenship, where systems and schools establish the patterns for and promote inclusive, supportive, tolerant, egalitarian socialization, of a sort that can make every child's and every young adult's life aspirations a reality, but which is also relevant for the acquisition of a civic education that is both lever and fulcrum for fair, egalitarian, participatory societies.;"[Roman Carrasco, Marcela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, CIDE, Santiago 1825, Chile; [Murillo Torrecilla, F.

For this, a quasi-experimental experiment was designed, and a quantitative methodology was used through pretest and posttest in a control and experimental group in which the effectiveness of two teaching models was compared, one more traditional based on exercises written on paper and another based on interaction with a chatbot. Subsequently, the perception of the experimental group in an academic forum about the educational use of the chatbot was analyzed through text mining with tests of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), pairwise distance matrix and bigrams. The quantitative results showed that the students in the experimental group substantially improved the results compared to the students with a more traditional methodology (experimental group / mean: 32.1346 / control group / mean: 28.4706). Punctuation correctness has been improved mainly in the usage of comma, colon and periods in different syntactic patterns. Furthermore, the perception of the students in the experimental group showed that they positively value chatbots in their teaching-learning process in three dimensions: greater support and companionship in the learning process, as they perceive greater interactivity due to their conversational nature; greater feedback and interaction compared to the more traditional methodology and, lastly, they especially value the ease of use and the possibility of interacting and learning anywhere and anytime.";"[Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Mengual-Andres, Santiago] Univ Valencia, Sch Philosophy & Educ, Dept Comparat Educ & Hist Educ, Valencia, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Pablo Olavide, Fac Social Sci, Dept Educ & Social Psychol, Seville, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Atacama, IICSE, Dir Ext & Relac Int, Atacama, Chile";;"Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.";evazquez@edu.uned.es;"López-Meneses, E./G-1307-2011; Mengual-Andrés, Santiago/E-8045-2011";"López-Meneses, E./0000-0003-0741-5367; Mengual-Andrés, Santiago/0000-0002-1588-9741; Vazquez-Cano, Esteban/0000-0002-6694-7948";"I + D + I Project; FEDER (European Regional Development Fund)European Commission [RTI2018-099764-B-100]; Ministry of Science, Innovation";This research has been developed with the support of the I + D + I Project entitled: ``Gamification and ubiquitous learning in Primary Education.

The intent is to employ this policy without sacrificing predictive validity of college success. This study explores the theory of action of the high school ranking policy, as well as the high school ranking's ability to predict students' persistence in higher education system and in Chile's higher education institutions using logistic regressions with fixed and random effects (intercepts) and country-wide data. The theory of action shows a main focus on access and a less intense emphasis on the goal of predicting academic success. The access goal is addressed through considerations during the admission process, and there are few efforts geared toward recruitment and graduation. Results also suggest that the high school ranking marginally helps predict college persistence at the institutional level, but only among students attending traditional universities. In light of results, it is recommended that traditional institutions keep working collaboratively to provide new admissions processes that are transparent, equitable, efficient and predict college success.;"[Veronica Santelices, Maria; Catalan, Ximena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Horn, Catherine] Univ Houston, Coll Educ, Stephen Power Farish Hall,3657 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Venegas, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Matemat, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile";;Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;vsanteli@uc.cl;"HORN, CATHERINE L./B-4520-2015; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015; Catalan, Ximena/H-3252-2017";"HORN, CATHERINE L./0000-0003-4959-5810; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047; Catalan, Ximena/0000-0003-1408-7621";Chile's Ministry of Education [F811363, FONDECYT 1160871];This research was funded in part by Chile's Ministry of Education through research Project F811363 and through Project FONDECYT 1160871.

Authentic assessment aims to replicate the tasks and performance standards typically found in the world of work, and has been found to have a positive impact on student learning, autonomy, motivation, self-regulation and metacognition; abilities highly related to employability. Despite these benefits, there are significant barriers to the introduction of authentic assessment, particularly where there is a tradition of testing' decontextualised subject knowledge. One barrier may be the lack of conceptualisation of the term authentic assessment sufficient to inform assessment design at the individual course level. This article tackles that omission by a systematic review of literature from 1988 to 2015. Thirteen consistent characteristics of authentic assessment are identified leading to the classification of three conceptual dimensions: realism, cognitive challenge and evaluative judgement. These dimensions are elaborated and used to propose a step-based model for designing and operating authentic assessment in individual higher education subjects.";"[Villarroel, Veronica; Bruna, Daniela] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Ctr Res & Improvement Educ CIME, Concepcion, Chile; [Bloxham, Susan] Univ Cumbria, Fac Educ, City Of Carlisle, England; [Bruna, Carola] Univ Concepcion, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Concepcion, Chile; [Herrera-Seda, Constanza] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Concepcion, Chile";;Villarroel, V (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Ctr Res & Improvement Educ CIME, Concepcion, Chile.;vvillarroel@udd.cl;;"villarroel, veronica/0000-0002-3000-2248; Bruna, Carola/0000-0003-0554-7147";;;;89;61;63;7;34;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0260-2938;1469-297X;;ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU;Assess.

International partnership has been an essential part of these strategies. Partnerships help institutions in creating practices that are costly, as well as enhancing reputation by partnering with prestigious schools. Moreover, different spectrums of partnerships require varying degrees of commitment. Noting that the motivation for and engagement in partnerships is particularly strong in business, and the region of Latin America as well as Asia and Oceania, this study attempts to depict how institutions engage internationalisation, revealed as the exchange network and dual degree network of the 20 best MBA programmes in the two regions. Employing social network analysis, we found that schools have different levels of engagement in building partnerships and the region and reputation of schools matter for partnerships. Top-ranked MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners and have a higher level of popularity in the exchange network. The dual degree network was more restricted in terms of the number, country, and prestige. Asian and Oceanian MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners but are less likely to engage in dual degree partnerships, compared to the Latin American MBA programmes. Some institutions focus their dual degree network on a particular region. As higher education institutions actively engage in various types of collaborations, the findings provide meaningful implications for understanding the patterns of international partnership among higher education institutions.;"[Kim, Jeongeun] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Sch Sci & Engn, Beauchef 850, Santiago 8370448, Chile";;Kim, J (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;;Kim, Jeongeun/N-9390-2019;"Kim, Jeongeun/0000-0002-3736-1446; Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608";;;;83;3;3;3;53;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

The financial aid policy for students in Chile has undergone major changes over the last decade, which has allowed individuals from usually underrepresented income groups to enroll in higher education institutions. This analysis combines information from four public administrative agencies, obtaining a sample of over 75 % of all high school graduates for the period 2007-2010. Methods include descriptive statistics, logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Both continuous persistence and reentry were studied at the system and at the institutional level for all four cohorts. Descriptive results show that short- and long-term dropout rates at the system level are high, and dropout rates are even higher at the level of institutions. Findings from the PSM show that the non-subsidized state loan is the instrument that displays the strongest correlation with persistence and it holds homogeneously across students from different socioeconomic groups. Among grants, we find consistently positive effects of need-based grants targeting low-income students attending technical institutions.

Within these rankings, Ibero-American journals have had little-to almost no-presence. This raises awareness on the current state of journal indexes and on what these indexes do and how they have been used in constituting sites of exclusion within the mathematics education community. We contend that ranking systems are perceived as the philosopher's stone of academia, in the sense that they have the ability to convert any material (an article, a journal, the academic production of a scholar) into a precious material within the academic world. This alchemic move not only exacerbates exclusion, but also configures a point system that constitutes places for enjoyment and fetishistic disavowal within researchers. Thus, we want to challenge the assumption that mainstream journal rankings are able to accurately reflect the quality, impact, and reputation of mathematics education journals by taking as empirical data the Ibero-American journals in the field of mathematics education. In problematizing journal ranking effects in the production, dissemination, and socialization of knowledge, we seek to open a discussion regarding the economic-political dynamics that govern publishing practices in mathematics education and that are entangled in the production of knowledge in our discipline.;"[Andrade-Molina, Melissa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile; [Montecino, Alex] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Escuela Invest & Postgrad, Gen Jofre 462, Santiago 8330225, Chile; [Sanchez Aguilar, Mario] Inst Politecn Nacl, Programa Matemat Educ, CICATA Legaria, Calzada Legaria 694, Mexico City, DF, Mexico";;Andrade-Molina, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile.;"melissa.andrade@puev.el; alex.montecino.em@gmail.com; mosanchez@ipn.mx";Aguilar, Mario Sánchez/Q-9569-2018;"Aguilar, Mario Sánchez/0000-0002-1391-9388; Andrade-Molina, Melissa/0000-0003-1535-3194; Montecino, Alex/0000-0002-2412-8290";;;;22;2;2;0;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

Access to high-quality provision of early education and care is not implemented. Against this background, the paper explores young children's everyday life practices in these specific centres. This paper presents findings from an explorative ethnographic research project in refugee accommodation centres in Germany. Researchers accompanied 12 children aged three to seven years old in their daily play and family activities through participant observation in different refugee centres. Against the constraints of their life circumstances, refugee children's activities are discussed as children's unique ways of appropriation, demonstrating social actor-ship. In outlook, the paper highlights co-operative work with refugee parents and the use of ethnographic research findings to inform programmes in Early Childhood Education and Care.;"[Wihstutz, Anne] Protestant Univ Appl Sci Berlin, EHB, Berlin, Germany; [Wihstutz, Anne] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile";;"Wihstutz, A (corresponding author), Protestant Univ Appl Sci Berlin, EHB, Berlin, Germany.; Wihstutz, A (corresponding author), Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile.";Wihstutz@eh-berlin.de;;;;;;52;4;4;0;4;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1350-293X;1752-1807;;EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC;Eur.

School improvement is a complex endeavoura complexity that is intensified for newly appointed principals, particularly when placed in a high-poverty, ineffective school. This article explores changes introduced by newly appointed principals placed in elementary public schools that were struggling (n = 4) and in schools that were sinking (n = 5). Findings show that all participants converged on actions to promote changes in: staffing, redesigning the organisation, and managing instruction. The quality of the actions, however, differed by type of school, highlighting the importance of defining policies for strengthening school leadership that take into account differences among schools. Induction will provide needed support at the individual level, but it might be insufficient support if other measures at the district level fail to create conditions, such as staffing, so the arrival of a new principal is indeed an opportunity to reverse a downward trajectory of an ineffective, high-poverty school.;"[Galdames, Sergio] UCL Inst Educ, Educ Leadership, London, England; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Campos, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Veronica Leiva, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl;", CIAE/R-5423-2017; galdames, sergio/P-5604-2019";"galdames, sergio/0000-0001-6836-7595; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848; Leiva Guerrero, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-7641-0087";"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140906]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 0003]";The authors are grateful for the financial support provided, at different stages of the study, by FONDECYT Grant # 1140906 and by CONICYT FB 0003.

However, international evidence consistently shows that the prevailing modes of classroom talk are monologic. The problem is how to transform science education into dialogic and argumentative spaces. One way to do this is through the use of curriculum materials that support and scaffold dialogic practices. Although there is growing interest in promoting argumentation through curriculum materials, their effect on students' learning and the relationship between curriculum-supported argumentation and learning are still not clear.PurposeThe aim of this study was to contribute to this knowledge gap. We replicated research conducted in the UK as part of the epiSTEMe project, in which curriculum materials supporting dialogic classroom talk were developed and evaluated through a randomised experimental study.SampleA total of 220 students (aged 10-11 years) from 18 classrooms participated in the study, with the classrooms spread across 18 public schools all located in Santiago, Chile.Design and methodWe conducted an experimental study randomised at school level. Eleven teachers delivered science lessons following a teaching programme especially developed to foster dialogic and argumentative classroom talk (the intervention group), and seven teachers delivered lessons in their usual way (the control group). Students were assessed individually using pre- and post-measures of science content knowledge and argumentative skills.ResultsThe results showed that the intervention group obtained significantly higher pre- to post-gains on science content knowledge. Although the control group engaged in significantly more whole-class argumentative dialogue than the intervention group, this did not predict content knowledge learning in the control group. By contrast, in the intervention group the frequency of whole-class argumentative dialogue had a strong and positive effect on the delayed content knowledge post-test, controlling for initial measures.;"[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England";;Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago, Chile.;alarrain@uahurtado.cl;"; Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017";"Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231; Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516";Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11100181];This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) project no 11100181.;;57;8;9;3;33;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0263-5143;1470-1138;;RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC;Res.

However, despite the multiplicity of educational applications using paper-based computing, their deployment in authentic settings is still marginal. To better understand this gap between research proposals and everyday classroom application, we surveyed the field of augmented paper systems applied to education, using the notion of classroom orchestration as a conceptual tool to understand its potential for integration in everyday educational practice. Our review organizes and classifies the affordances of these systems, and reveals that comparatively few studies provide evidence about the learning effects of system usage, or perform evaluations in authentic setting conditions. The analysis of those proposals that have performed authentic evaluations reveals how paper based-systems can accommodate a variety of contextual constraints and pedagogical approaches, but also highlights the need for further longitudinal, in-the-wild studies, and the existence of design tensions that make the conception, implementation and appropriation of this kind of systems still challenging.;"[Prieto, Luis P.; Wen, Yun; Dillenbourg, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CHILI Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Caballero, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Prieto, LP (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CHILI Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;"luis.prieto@epfl.ch; yun.wen@epfl.ch; dccaball@uc.cl; pierre.dillenbourg@epfl.ch";"Wen, Yun/D-8156-2019; Prieto, Luis P./V-5313-2019; Prieto, Luis P./K-4236-2015";"Wen, Yun/0000-0002-6334-9790; Prieto, Luis P./0000-0002-0057-0682; Prieto, Luis P./0000-0002-0057-0682";;;;78;19;19;0;18;INT FORUM EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOC-IFETS;DOULIU CITY;NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

This paper examines this issue as it is exemplified by the Teachers of Teachers Network (TTN), a program developed by Chile's Ministry of Education. As a program designed to identify and reward high quality teachers, it draws from New Public Management's version of professionalism, which promotes managerial cultures based on individual, test-based incentives. TTN members are granted the opportunity to become entrepreneurs, offering professional development (PD) services to other teachers. As a program designed to develop high quality teachers, it draws from a sociocultural version of teacher professionalism based on the development of interpersonal relations that enhance the collective capacity to solve problems. The results of the current study highlight limitations of implementing teacher quality policies that simultaneously draw from contrasting ideas of professionalism. The five TTN teachers participating in the current study resolved these contradictions by concealing their TTN status and (re)presenting themselves as members of the regular teaching force (peers). Through these discursive moves they subverted the possibility of trust, a key nutrient for collegial learning. These findings are interpreted through Hargreaves' capital theory of school effectiveness and improvement.;"[Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen] Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Campos-Martinez, Javier] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pino, Mauricio] Univ Illinois, Global Studies Educ Div, Urbana, IL USA; [Dominguez, Rosario] St Margarets British Sch Girls, Lomas De Montemar Concon, Chile";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ave Brasil 2950, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@ucv.cl;"PINO, MAURICIO/V-3439-2018; Campos-Martinez, Javier/AAQ-1351-2020; Carreño-Durán, Claudia-Inés/H-6488-2016; , CIAE/R-5423-2017";"Campos-Martinez, Javier/0000-0002-2695-8896; Carreño-Durán, Claudia-Inés/0000-0001-5021-3344; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848";;;;50;12;14;1;37;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

Reasons for this include the mismatch between the methods used to measure the effects and the type of learning promoted, the absence of information regarding the specific types of ICT used, and the scarce attention paid to the monitoring and evaluation of ICT for Education (ICT4E) programs. A monitoring and evaluation scheme would provide qualitative and quantitative data to refine, adjust and improve an ICT4E project, to learn from the experience gained, and to determine whether the program has served its client communities and how it might be replicated. In this paper we present a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) scheme for a specific ICT4E program that supports teaching and learning using mobile computer supported collaborative learning (MCSCL). Using the information provided by the scheme, we analyze the program's impact on student attainment in terms of teacher adoption of innovation. It was found that there were statistically significant positive differences in students whose teachers showed higher adoption levels when compared both to lower adoption cases and other defined control groups. We conclude that an M&E scheme supports the intervention process by providing real-time information for decision making through the application of assessment instruments according to a monitoring plan. This enables intervention activities to be adjusted so as to ensure an adequate level of adoption.;"[Rodriguez, Patricio; Nussbaum, Miguel; Sepulveda, Marcos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy";;Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;"patricio@ing.puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; marcos@ing.puc.cl; mxlopez@uniroma3.it";"Sepulveda, Marcos/C-4007-2011; Rodríguez, Patricio/F-8606-2015; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";"Rodríguez, Patricio/0000-0002-7361-5132; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983";;;;34;17;18;0;19;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

An Augmented Reality app to analyze digital current (DC) in resistive circuits was developed was developed to enhance students' understanding of electricity. The app allows the manipulation of circuit elements, computes the voltage and amperage values using the loop method by applying Kirchhoff's voltage law. A model with the following variables was theoretically conceived: subjective norms, technology optimism, technology innovativeness, attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use. The study considered a sample of 173 engineering students and was carried out using structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that subjective norms have a positive effect on technology optimism and technology innovativeness. Further, attitude toward using was found to depend on a medium range of students' characteristics, such as technology optimism and technology innovativeness. The results suggest that the academic environment can influence a student's beliefs concerning new technologies. Understanding how the educational environment can affect students' attitudes toward the use of new technologies can help higher education institutions establish policies for their adoption to facilitate the learning process.;"[Alvarez-Marin, Alejandro] Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Ind, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Velazquez-Iturbide, J.

The MOBAK battery is designed to assess basic motor competencies in primary education. It differentiates by the stage in the curriculum, and proposes a two-factor structure corresponding to the basic motor competencies of object movement and self-movement. This study has three objectives: to determine the construct validity of three test instruments of the MOBAK battery for assessing motor competencies; to determine how gender, BMI, and age covariates relate to motor competencies; and to examine the level of basic motor competencies of primary school children in Chile. A total of 1,785 children (45.7% girls) were assessed, divided into 1st and 2nd grade (MOBAK 1-2; 559 children; 50.6 % girls), 3rd and 4th grade (MOBAK 3-4; 496 children, 39.3 % girls), and 5th and 6th grade (MOBAK 5-6; 730 children, 46.3 % girls). The construct validity of each section was analysed using the confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA). The results confirm the two-factor structure in all sections of the MOBAK battery, they confirm the relationship between motor competencies and the covariates gender, BMI, and age, and they show that Chilean primary school children have low levels of motor competence, especially in 5th and 6th grade.

To that end, we have administered the instrument to 95 in-service Spanish teachers and we have also analysed the presence of mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections and representation) in teaching practice. The descriptive statistics obtained through a quantitative study show that all the items perform similarly in each of the processes, obtaining medium to high scores. A change in this trend is only detected in some of the items of the mathematical process connections, which measure if mathematical knowledge is related to other disciplines. The results obtained from the exploratory factor analysis show a high coefficient for all the processes (higher than 0.72), as well as a significant p value, and the results obtained from the confirmatory factor analysis show an internal consistency of the items of each construct, with values greater than 0.8.;"[Alsina, Angel] Univ Girona, Dept Specif Didact, Placa St Domenec 4, Girona 17004, Spain; [Maurandi, Antonio; Ferre, Elvira] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain; [Coronata, Claudia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Alsina, A (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Specif Didact, Placa St Domenec 4, Girona 17004, Spain.;angel.alsina@udg.edu;Alsina, Angel/E-5347-2010;"Alsina, Angel/0000-0001-8506-1838; Maurandi Lopez, Antonio/0000-0002-4292-8312";;;;51;5;5;2;6;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1571-0068;1573-1774;;INT J SCI MATH EDUC;Int.

Several of these aspects can be categorised within the framework of the nature of science, or NOS. We warn that a possible misinterpretation of the common view of NOS tenets can lead to epistemic relativism. We pay special attention to the empirical and objective nature of science because these important features, properly understood, can help eliminate subjective flaws and protect against relativism. Some of the epistemological concepts that are relevant to this discussion are disambiguated in an attempt to prevent the temptation to take views to an extreme, as has occurred in some cases.

This study addressed this issue for the Chilean national teacher evaluation system. Mathematics teachers (N = 51) from the 2 middle adjacent performance categories, and their students, were examined by videotaping classroom practice and coding the videos with the Classroom Assessment Scoring System for Secondary School, measuring students' perceptions of their teachers' practices and assessing student learning on standardized grade-level and unit-specific tests. Findings show that on almost all criterion variables, competent teachers outperformed basic teachers, but differences were usually small. Teachers evaluated as competent obtained consistently better results regarding their teaching practices, as assessed by trained observers, as well as based on reports by their own students. However, there was only weak indication of differences between the 2 groups in terms of student learning.;"[Taut, Sandy; Jimenez, Daniela; Palacios, Diego; Godoy, Maria Ines; Manzi, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Puente-Duran, Sofia] Ryerson Univ, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada";;Taut, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile.;staut@ucla.edu;Palacios, Diego/F-2243-2015;"Palacios, Diego/0000-0001-6840-0068; Godoy, MI/0000-0003-2497-9404; Puente, Sofia/0000-0001-5948-3498";;;;50;1;1;5;20;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

The present study centres on secondary history teachers' teaching conceptions as a precursor to the ways in which they use computing technology in the classroom. The research is a qualitative study examining the theoretical assumption that teachers' conceptions of teaching and learning guide their pedagogical action. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 Chilean history teachers, and their didactic sequences were filmed extensively. The research found patterns among educational uses of technology in relation to teaching conceptions (defining the latter based on three conceptual groups: direct instruction or individual or social construction of knowledge) in terms of the allotment of time and the manner of teacher technology use, and less sharply defined patterns were also noted in student technology use and teacher-student-technology interactions.";"[Arancibia Herrera, Marcelo] Southern Univ Chile, Inst Educ Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Badia Gargante, Antoni] Open Univ Catalonia, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Soto Caro, Carmen Paz] San Sebastian Univ, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Lee Sigerson, Andrew] Southern Univ Chile, Inst Linguist & Literature, Valdivia, Chile";;Sigerson, AL (corresponding author), Southern Univ Chile, Inst Linguist & Literature, Valdivia, Chile.;andrew.sigerson@uach.cl;Badia, Antoni/K-2640-2017;"Badia, Antoni/0000-0003-1294-8061; Arancibia-Herrera, Marcelo/0000-0002-4314-4253";;;;37;5;6;0;26;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1475-939X;1747-5139;;TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC;Technol.

The specialized literature has defined three predominant regulatory models: the traditional bureaucratic professional model, the quasi-market model inspired by neoliberal thought, and the evaluative state model linked to the notion of new public management. This paper seeks to contribute to this line of analysis by studying the evolution of the Chilean education system since 1980. We describe and analyze the models of regulation that have governed Chilean education and their expression in educational reforms and policies; we assert that Chile has adopted all three mentioned models. We also identify some of the principal consequences of these policies: a highly atomized, privatized, and socioeconomically segregated school system; an improvement in access to education and the conditions for the educational process; and an increase in learning outcomes, despite starting from very low levels and stalling during the past decade while remaining highly unequal in character. Thus, we propose some hypotheses to interpret those changes, relating them to the models of regulation as well as the policies previously analyzed. Overall, we affirm that the market and evaluative state models have achieved modest positive effects while producing relevant undesirable consequences. We conclude the paper with a reflection on the character of the particular hybridization of regulatory models developed in Chile, and the types of policy we believe should be prioritized to improve quality, increase innovation, and diminish inequity.";"[Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain";;Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl; gonzalo.munozs@mail.udp.cl";"; Bellei, Cristian/D-9921-2015";"Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841; Bellei, Cristian/0000-0001-6963-7809";"ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Becas Chile Program";Support from ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.

Based on the revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT-2), a theoretical model adapted to the study context was proposed. The impact of the attitude towards PowerPoint, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, and habit, in the intention to use and actual use of PowerPoint was evaluated. A survey was applied to 106 university professors from two Spanish universities, and the theoretical model was subsequently tested using a path analysis. The results suggest the existence of a direct non-critical path consisting of social pressure and habit, and an indirect critical path consisting of performance expectancy via the attitude towards PowerPoint. This research highlights the importance of critical reflection in the use of technological tools such as PowerPoint in classrooms.

Most evidence is based on small- and medium-scale studies from developed countries, with results that cannot be generalized. We explore which areas of mathematics are the most important predictors of future performance by considering the sociodemographic and academic factors of Chile. Scores from a standardized test for eighth-grade mathematics and fourth-grade language arts were analyzed for a sample of 158,818 students, together with data on different areas of fourth-grade mathematics. The results reveal that the association of future performance in mathematics with number skills is as strong as the association of future performance in mathematics with attending an elite private school, in comparison to attending a state-subsidized school. Literacy skills also proved to be an important predictor of future performance in mathematics.;"[Santana, Macarena; Cabezas, Veronica; Nussbaum, Miguel; Claro, Magdalena; Maldonado, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Cabello-Hutt, Tania] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA";;Santana, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.;;;;"CONICYT-PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL [21151531]; CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180024]; CONICYT/FONDECYT INICIACIONComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150341]; Millennium Nucleus of Social Development - Millennium Scientific Initiative";"This work was funded by CONICYT-PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL 21151531, CONICYT/FONDECYT 1180024, and CONICYT/FONDECYT INICIACION 11150341.

These approaches have diminished teaching staff engagement with continuous curriculum improvement, without necessarily improving student outcome attainment. To illustrate mechanisms that engage and disengage teaching staff, we present a case study of a 3-year continuous improvement process implemented in a selective university in Chile. Throughout the process, 61 teaching staff members were involved in outcome assessment tasks and curriculum discussions. By triangulating three sources of evidence (97 assessment plans, 27 meeting minutes and 11 interviews), we identified engagement mechanisms that were related to staff members' motivation to improve student outcomes, and disengagement mechanisms that were related to their reticence towards misaligned and externally imposed policies. Teaching staff's perspectives on continuous improvement were discussed for further generalization of these mechanisms.;"[Hilliger, Isabel; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, Sch Engn & Sci, FCFM, Almirante Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France";;Hilliger, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.;ihillige@ing.puc.cl;Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022;Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608;;;;30;0;0;2;10;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;0952-8733;1740-3863;;HIGH EDUC POLICY;High Educ.

Educators, schools and corporations are increasingly driving these initiatives. This article makes the argument that a narrow vision of digital technology, which both ignores the complexity of education and wastes valuable public resources, is becoming an obstacle to significant improvement and transformation in education. Utilising our research and experience in the field of educational technology, this paper problematises the common elision of 'technology' and 'digital technology'. From this basis, we then critically reflect on various common approaches to introducing digital technology in education under the guise of promoting equality and digital inclusion. These include national government-led programmes, more recent trends for local school-led initiatives, and the role of non-formal education initiatives led by corporations/foundations. Amidst the varying surface-level 'failure' and/or 'success' of these approaches, we point to limited underpinning 'information and knowledge society' logics in framing the application of digital technology to education. As such we conclude by considering the educational challenges for future Ed-Tech initiatives.;"[Sancho-Gil, Juana M.; Rivera-Vargas, Pablo; Mino-Puigcercos, Raquel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Educ Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Santiago, Chile";;Sancho-Gil, JM (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Educ Management, Barcelona, Spain.;jmsancho@ub.edu;"Puigcercós, Raquel Miño/I-1995-2015; Vargas, Pablo Rivera/AAL-9231-2021; Sancho-Gil, Juana M/L-3047-2014; Pimentel, Priscilla/AAG-6402-2019; Napierala, Joanna/AAU-1256-2020";"Vargas, Pablo Rivera/0000-0002-9564-2596; Mino Puigcercos, Raquel/0000-0002-5391-4637; JUANA MARIA, SANCHO-GIL/0000-0002-2941-5619";"ESBRINA - Contemporary Subjectivities, Visualities and Educational Environments [2014SGR 0632]; REUNI+D - University Network for Educational Research and Innovation; Social Changes and Challenges to Education the Digital Age (MINECO) [EDU2015-68718-REDT]";ESBRINA - Contemporary Subjectivities, Visualities and Educational Environments (2014SGR 0632) http://esbrina.eu REUNI+D - University Network for Educational Research and Innovation.

Within the last decade, economic migrants from Ukraine, Russia, Romania and Moldova set up a number of supplementary schools across the country. No academic attention has been given to the phenomenon of supplementary ethnic schools in Portugal, whilst there is a growing interest in and beyond Europe in the ways they serve as cultural, social and political sources for identity negotiation, and structures for social capital formation in migrant communities. This study addresses this gap in knowledge. Drawing on a survey completed by 184 students between the ages of 12 and 20, attending eight Ukrainian supplementary schools, this paper contributes to wider international research through its mapping of the population of Ukrainian schools in Portugal and examining students' reasons for attendance, highlighting both positive and negative aspects of their experiences.

UNESCO's SERCE (Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study) database was mined for information about 2,580 principals from 16 Latin-American countries. Data indicate that just 57.7% of school principals in the region are occupied full-time by their school job, and on average they spend 80% of their school time on managerial work and the other 20% on classroom teaching. Of the time allocation directly related to management, principals spend an average of 25% on administrative tasks, 16% on activities related with instructive leadership and 16% on tasks pertaining to supervising and advising the teaching staff (although this varies widely among countries). It was also found that the principal's age, the school's size and the situation of the zone where the school is located are factors that influence time distribution. Lastly, the percentage of time principals spend on educational leadership tasks has a positive influence on the performance of the school's students. School management policies in Latin America should be reformulated to free principals from administrative tasks in order to enable them to devote themselves to activities related with educational leadership.;"[Murillo Torrecilla, F.

Interviews were held with academics at both public and private well-established universities and new private universities. The analysis shows a consensus regarding the production of certain public goods such as knowledge, wider access and the promotion of a public sphere. It also reveals a dissensus such that academics at well-established universities tend to maintain a statist view of the public university in which the state plays a key role while academics at new private universities characteristically adopt an individualist view in which the university is detached from the state and more focused on securing social mobility. Drawing on an Archerian framework, it is suggested that these perceptions have been shaped by global, national and especially institutional factors.

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December).

Design/methodology/approach - Graduates of professional psychology and teaching programs from three Chilean universities responded to a questionnaire asking their perception of different aspects of their degree program and experiences in their first employment. The three universities differ significantly in the proportion of applicants admitted, and in their prestige. Findings - Salary levels are highly related to profession, but unrelated to graduates' ratings of quality of curriculum or teaching methods. Overall satisfaction with the university experience is not linked to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction, on the other hand, is highly influenced by salary and secondarily by instructional practices and perceived work relevance of the degree program. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on data from 3 of Chile's 60 universities, and graduates of two programs. Most employment in the two professions is regulated by labor agreements. Generalizability of results is limited. Graduates may not have been employed enough to demonstrate their capacities. Practical implications - The findings offer more evidence that prestige ratings are an unreliable indicator of the quality of formation offered by universities. If the government seeks to reduce income inequality, public subsidies of higher education should be based on program quality rather than on institutional prestige. Originality/value - The findings are directly relevant to the current debate in Chile about what might and what might not help to reduce severe economic inequality.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar; Gonzalez, Luis; Castillo, Dante] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, Swampscott, MA USA; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Santiago, Chile";;"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile.; Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile.";"pirata14@hotmail.com; nmcginn@igc.org; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; dcastillo@estudiospiie.cl";"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019";"McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Sandoval, Luis/0000-0001-9452-4945; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980; Castillo, Dante/0000-0002-5648-0627";Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151016];This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt) under Grant No. 1151016.;;77;2;2;1;4;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0040-0912;1758-6127;;EDUC TRAIN;Educ.

The aim of this paper is to show how SDG can be used to improve the way resources are used in schools, allowing students to work simultaneously on individual problems at a shared display, and achieve personalized learning with individual feedback within different cultural contexts. We used computational fluency to apply our concept of One Mouse per Child. It consists of a participatory approach that makes use of personal feedback on an interpersonal computer for the whole classroom. This allows for N simultaneous intelligent tutoring systems, where each child advances at his or her own pace, both within a lecture and throughout the curricular units. Each student must solve a series of mathematical exercises, generated according to his or her performance through a set of pedagogical rules incorporated into the system. In this process, the teacher has an active mediating role, intervening when students require attention. Two exploratory studies were performed. The first study was a multicultural experience between two such distanced socio-economic realities as Chile and India. It showed us that even in different environmental conditions, it is possible to implement this technology with minimal equipment (i.e. a computer, a projector, and one mouse per child). The second study was carried out in a third grade class in a low-income school in Santiago de Chile. The students were asked to solve mainly addition exercises. We established statistically relevant results and observed that the software proved most beneficial for the students with the lowest initial results. This happens because the system adapts to the students' needs, reinforcing the content they most need to work on, thus generating a personalized learning process.;"[Alcoholado, C.; Nussbaum, M.; Tagle, A.; Gomez, F.; Denardin, F.; Susaeta, H.; Villalta, M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Toyama, K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";;Nussbaum, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;mn@ing.puc.cl;"Villalta, Marco/B-9555-2012; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013";"Villalta, Marco/0000-0002-7553-925X; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Gomez Zaccarelli, Florencia/0000-0003-0916-0062; Toyama, Kentaro/0000-0002-9128-2255";;;;31;22;22;1;21;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

About 980 active academic staff from 43 Spanish public universities participated. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as a theoretical framework for the operational definition of the variables. Through the use of data mining techniques (clustering and decision trees), groupings were made based on the b-learning adoption stage and a subsequent predictive model of these stages. The results show that the intention to use BL is the most important predictor variable in all models applied. In addition, the relationship between higher frequency of use and experience in digital educational environments with higher stages of implementation of the BL methodology was verified. Regarding the socio-demographic variables included in the study, it was observed that they exert effects that are marginal in all cases. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many universities and higher education institutions are designing strategic plans and diverse actions to implement and spread the use of BL methodologies. TAM has been widely used to study the behaviour and the intention of using a wide variety of specific technologies in the classroom. The study of BL from the perspective of TAM has generally been carried out using inferential analysis techniques. What this paper adds Analysis of complex systems such as the BL methodology from the TAM approach. Groups of adopting teachers can be analysed using the TAM approach according to the stage of use of this innovation. In contrast to traditional inferential techniques, this paper proposes a methodological procedure based on decision trees, which facilitates a more refined analysis of the relationship and interactions between the set of TAM predictor variables (PU, PEOU, BI, etc.) and the criterion variable (stages of adoption). The obtaining of more complete and adjusted trees leads to better prediction and identification of the concrete actions that could be implemented by higher education institutions as protective or motivating factors for the diffusion of the BL methodology. Implications for practice and/or policy Interest in focusing attention on a complex system such as the one represented by the BL methodology from the perspective of models of technological acceptance reinforces an interesting line of research that can enrich the approach and scope of the TAM theory and generates knowledge that helps promote strategic actions to optimise the institutional diffusion of the BL training modality in higher education contexts.;"[Victor Martin-Garcia, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Salamanca, Spain; [Martinez-Abad, Fernando] Univ Salamanca, Educ Fac, Salamanca, Spain; [Reyes-Gonzalez, David] Metropolitan Univ Educ Sci, Fac Chem, Nunoa, Chile";;Martin-Garcia, AV (corresponding author), Fac Educ, Paseo Canalejas 169, Salamanca 37008, Spain.;avmg@usal.es;"Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/L-4931-2014; Martínez-Abad, Fernando/H-3129-2015; Moreira, Juan Pablo Hernández/AAL-9552-2021";"Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/0000-0002-0216-2754; Martínez-Abad, Fernando/0000-0002-1783-8198; Moreira, Juan Pablo Hernández/0000-0001-7110-6054; Reyes-Gonzalez, David/0000-0002-1731-5784";;;;44;7;9;3;55;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0007-1013;1467-8535;;BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL;Br.

For this study, qualitative research was undertaken using interviews with 39 secondary school teachers, grouping their interpretations into three types of thinking: positive-mythical, positive-critical and negative-critical. The results show that most teachers expressed some kind of critical interpretation by developing a complex thinking of historical argumentation and analysis. The age variable age did not show remarkable results, but differences were observed with respect to the geographical variable, predominating the critical-negative view in regions where independence movements are developed. However, in relation to the purposes of history teaching, we find an important distance between the ideal discourse and the concrete examples with which they argue their position. That is, many of the teachers with a conception of critical history and connected with the present, found the value of their teaching in an exemplary and closed story of the past, rarely interpretive or critical.;"[Martinez-Rodriguez, Rosendo; Sanchez-Agusti, Maria] Univ Valladolid, Segovia, Spain; [Munoz Labrana, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";;Martinez-Rodriguez, R (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Fac Educ Segovia, Plaza Univ 1, Segovia 40005, Spain.;rosendo.martinez@uva.es;"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/F-2103-2015; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/R-5186-2018";"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/0000-0001-7163-3276; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/0000-0003-3816-0432";;;;48;4;5;3;9;MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;MADRID;SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN;0034-8082;1988-592X;;REV EDUC-MADRID;Rev.

It also studies the extent to which teacher observable characteristics, such as teacher training variables, are associated to better performance on either of these measures and whether any of these two assessments is able to effectively measure teacher quality isolated from the effect of the context where teachers work. Context in this article is defined as any variable that is not under the direct control of the teacher but plays an important role on student learning and we believe is captured by school and municipal variables. The study uses hierarchical linear models and information from national and standardized assessments from Chile, specifically from the municipal education sector. Results show a small correlation between the two measures of teacher quality, in the lower end of results from previous studies conducted in the USA, and suggest that there is only a limited relationship between both measures of teacher quality. Teacher initial education type and professional development were statistically associated only to the standard-based measure of teacher quality. Context (both the school and municipal levels) plays an important role in the teacher effect measure, and in the standard-based measures, therefore, we conclude that neither of these measures are context-free. We expect that these results will contribute to the discussion about how to best measure teacher quality and how to evaluate teacher performance both in Chile and other parts of the world.;"[Veronica Santelices, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Veronica Santelices, Maria] Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Valencia, Edgar] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Matemat, Dept Estadist, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile; [Taut, Sandy] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile";;"Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.";"vsanteli@uc.cl; envalenc@gmail.com; jorge.gonzalez@mat.puc.cl; staut@uc.cl";"Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019; González, Jorge/R-7652-2019";"Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272; Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795";"Chilean government through the Fondecyt [11110262, SOC1107]; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile";This research was funded by the Chilean government through the Fondecyt Grant No. 11110262, Grant Anillo SOC1107, and by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile through internal research funding.

SILP includes a network learning setting involving a cluster of three schools supported by university partners that conduct peer reviews and a school learning setting involving school teams in conversations to mobilise new leadership for learning practices. The notions of joint practice development and multivoicedness in professional conversations are the essence of these processes. Data produced through the review process, understood as voices, enabled participants to incorporate the perspectives, conceptual horizon, and intentions of administrators, students, and teachers who need to collaborate for teaching to produce learning. Across schools we observed common learning as well as important differences. These differences show that by taking an active role in making sense of their participation in a professional development programme, learners achieve outcomes that may be much more meaningful than what program designers prescribed.

The objective of this study is to measure the effect of incorporating a variable of predisposition to mathematical tasks to a complex model, which also considers the student's formal and inductive logical reasoning skills regarding academic mathematics performance. Our aim is to assess to what extent success in mathematics provides feedback to students and how it influences overall academic achievement. In order to do so, different instruments were used, such as TOLT (Test of Logical Thinking), TILS (Test of Higher Logical Thinking) and a Likert-type scale to measure the predisposition for mathematical tasks. The interaction between variables was modeled using structural equations. The results show the important role that predisposition for mathematical tasks plays in academic performance. They also show how this predisposition interacts and modulates the effect of cognitive factors on overall academic performance, and how it also mitigates the strength of their univariate relationships.

One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4. It is recommended that further research be undertaken towards identifying effective competency-based syllabus design.";"[Jerez, Oscar; Hasbun, Beatriz; Valenzuela, Gabriela; Orsini, Cesar] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Leslier] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Santiago, Chile; [Pizarro, Veronica] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management Control & Informat Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, Cesar] Univ Glasgow, Sch Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";;Jerez, O (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile.;ojerez@fen.uchile.cl;"Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Jerez, Oscar/J-2947-2016";"Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Jerez, Oscar/0000-0003-0869-5938";;;;59;3;3;2;37;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND;1354-0602;1470-1278;;TEACH TEACH;Teach.

This paper documents answers for those questions using data for thirteen Latin-American countries circa 1997 and circa 2007. After controlling the earnings differentials by observable characteristics we find that teachers are underpaid vis-a-vis other professionals and technicians in Latin America both, circa 1997 and circa 2007; and both, at their main and secondary jobs. We document a decrease in the earnings gap during the decade of analysis, mostly attributed to a general trend in gap reduction rather than as a result of teachers' improvements on their observable characteristics. The earnings gap shows important heterogeneities, across countries and along the earnings distributions. Additionally, using information from the main and secondary jobs we find that individual penalties for teachers go beyond their observable characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings indicated that preservice teachers' skill to identify effective teaching interactions in others related to the effectiveness of the emotional support and instructional support exhibited in their observed classroom interactions. In addition, the study investigated the relationship between these skills and the teacher program characteristics. This study provides further evidence that the skill of noticing effective teaching interactions in others is related to implementing one's own effective classroom interactions. Thus, enhancing preservice teachers' noticing skills serves as an important target for current and future teacher training.;"[Wiens, Peter D.] Univ Nevada, Dept Teaching & Learning, Teacher Educ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [LoCasale-Crouch, Jennifer] Univ Virginia, Ctr Adv Study Teaching & Learning, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Cash, Anne Henry] Univ N Carolina, Reading & Elementary Educ, Charlotte, NC USA; [Escudero, Francisca Romo] Univ Diego Portales, Early Childhood Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Wiens, PD (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Teaching & Learning, Box 453005,4505 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.;peter.wiens@unlv.edu;LOCASALE-CROUCH, JENNIFER/R-2800-2018;"LOCASALE-CROUCH, JENNIFER/0000-0002-9965-472X; Wiens, Peter/0000-0002-1138-5079";;;;77;4;4;6;30;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0022-4871;1552-7816;;J TEACH EDUC;J.

In the mathematics education research field, arguments have been made that the conceptualization of Mathematics Identity (MI) is inconsistent and this makes the literature as a whole incoherent. This study aims to summarize how the concept has been employed and to develop an integrative model for analyzing concept-definitions and concept-operationalizations of MLI. An analysis of 69 papers revealed 3 main dimensions that characterized how identity is conceptually defined in any research literature (social/subjective, enacted/representational and change/stability) and 5 main categories that describe how the literature has implemented these dimensions operationally (identity as individual attributes; identity as narratives; identity as a relationship with specific practices; identity as ways of acting; and identities as afforded and constrained by local practices). An emphasis on representational aspects of identities, particularly during higher education, and enacted and practice-related identities during primary and secondary education research was found. The discussion shows how the field would be clarified if studies made their choices of conceptualization clear in terms of these dimensions and categories, and if research as a whole becomes more aware of restrictions/limitations in identity research, particularly at different points of the educational trajectory of students.";"[Radovic, Darinka] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Black, Laura; Williams, Julian] Univ Manchester, Sch Educ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Salas, Christian E.] Univ Diego Portales, Lab Neurociencia Cognit & Social LaNCyS, Escuela Psicol, Vergara 275, Santiago, Chile";;Radovic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.;dradovic@dim.uchile.cl;;"Williams, Julian/0000-0003-0161-0532; Black, Laura/0000-0002-3845-0459";"National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT); Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM); Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS [2807]";The work of the first author was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT) and by the Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM) and Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.;;101;23;23;9;37;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0013-1954;1573-0816;;EDUC STUD MATH;Educ.

We studied the interactions of one group of two teachers, who worked collectively in posing and solving a modeling problem through a closed group on the social network Facebook. The research question guiding this paper was how the development of mathematical modeling occurs from an Activity Theory perspective, recognizing tensions that occur, and its evolution in the process of posing and solving a modeling problem. The researchers took a qualitative approach, analyzing discursive manifestations in the modeling process. In the discussion, contradictions emerged in the group through events such as dilemma and conflict. The results indicate that the modeling task acted as an artifact that brought to light inner contradictions, and thus, allowed teachers to move from a conflict to the formulation of an open problem, and from a dilemma to the construction of a model and a pedagogic strategy.;"[Galleguillos, Jeannette] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [de Carvalho Borba, Marcelo] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil";;Galleguillos, J (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.;"jeannette.galleguillos@uv.cl; mborba@rc.unesp.br";;"Galleguillos, Jeannette/0000-0003-1089-0900; Borba, Marcelo/0000-0003-3101-5486";;;;43;3;3;2;16;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-9690;1863-9704;;ZDM-MATH EDUC;ZDM-Math.

The diversity of both entities intervening in the articulation, as well their nature, make possible to identify modeling as a recurrent practice in different communities. Modeling practice allows building bridges between what is done in school and in communities outside schools. In this practice, the model doesn't exist independent of the human activity. It manifests as model while intervening in the other entity, at this moment it is called the modeled entity. Despite the interaction with the entity to be modeled is necessary, its adequacy comes about with the intervention on it, through carrying out activity with the model. It is through this intervention that the modeling act is established.

Evaluation addressed topic mastery and opinions about the topic and the manner in which it was taught.

The research developed in a qualitative methodology manner; the data used for this article were collected through the solving of five robotic problems and an open-ended question that had to be answered by each of the 25 participants individually. The results showed that, in general, the most frequent error appeared in problems in which movements were set in a Euclidean space of two dimensions.

One of the stated objectives of the new policy was to increase the access of secondary school graduates from families with lower levels of education. To answer that concern, we analyzed administrative data from more than 800,000 students seeking university admission in 2012, 2015, and 2019. Our objective was to determine whether an increased proportion of first-generation students had been admitted to selective universities. The results show that between 2015 and 2019, the impact of the gratuity on first-generation admissions was marginal. It was of some importance only for those secondary school graduates from public schools and those who had been enrolled in the technical-professional track. The enrollment rate of these groups increased 2.2 and 2.7%, respectively. In sum, the effect of the introduction of gratuity on enrollment of first-generation students was not as impressive as expected. It has acted principally as an alternative source of finance, reducing use of other forms such as bank loans and scholarships. These results challenge directly the hypothesis that inequity in access to university is primarily attributable to financial difficulties.;"[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ PIIE, Ricardo Matte Perez 0510, Santiago, Chile; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, San Ignacio Loyola 160, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, 38 Sheridan Rd, Swampscott, MA 01907 USA; [Corradi, Bruno] Univ Tarapaca, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile";;Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.;"oespinoza@academia.cl; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; nmcginn@igc.org; bruno-corradi@hotmail.com";"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019";"Corradi, Bruno/0000-0002-4217-0900; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980";National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT [1200343];This research was supported by the National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT Project No1200343.

In the present study, academics in two public universities are seen to hold strong views in favour of public universities playing public roles and they identify several public goods that they value. These academics also hold ambivalent perceptions of the relationships between the state and the market. On the one hand, the market and the state's role in it are accorded a limited legitimacy. On the other hand, it is felt that the state does not sufficiently enable its public universities to realise their potential. The paper proceeds to argue that in this ambivalence can be detected four juxtapositions. It is suggested that these juxtapositions together open a space for a new settlement between the state and its public universities such that Chilean public universities might more fully realise their public possibilities.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Zavala, Ricardo; Morales, Karimme] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile.;cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile [AYV028/01-19]; Economic and Social Research Council [Centre for Global Higher Education] [ES/M010082/1]";Support from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and the Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile, codigo proyecto AYV028/01-19 are gratefully acknowledged.

The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which Chilean university graduates' satisfaction with their professional training is associated with experiences during the degree program they pursued, employment experiences including salary level, or the prestige level or image of the university they attended. Survey questionnaires were used to collect data from recent graduates of professional programs in Primary-Secondary Teaching and Psychology in three universities that differ in prestige.

To this aim, the results of a multiple case study are presented which prove that when teachers are faced with the task of evaluating processes of instruction, they employ-either implicitly or explicitly-the OSA criteria of didactical suitability (epistemic, cognitive, affective, mediational, interactional and ecological). Therefore, the explicit application of said criteria in teachers' education cycles contributes to the development of the didactic analysis competence that is necessary for teachers to be able to reflect on their own practices.;"[Breda, Adriana; Roberto Pino-Fan, Luis] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile; [Font, Vicenc] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain";;Pino-Fan, LR (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Exact Sci, C Lord Cochrane 1039, Osorno, Chile.;luis.pino@ulagos.cl;"Breda, Adriana/D-7124-2017; Pino-Fan, Luis R./Q-5687-2019; Breda, Adriana/X-5445-2019; Font, Vicenç/H-1598-2015";"Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Pino-Fan, Luis R./0000-0003-4060-7408; Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Font, Vicenç/0000-0003-1405-0458";"MINECO/FEDER, UE [EDU2015-64646-P]; ICE-UB [REDICE16-1520]; FONDECYT (CONICYT-Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150014]; PDSE program CAPES/Brazil [99999.004658/2014-00]";This work has been developed as part of the Research Projects on teacher training EDU2015-64646-P (MINECO/FEDER, UE), REDICE16-1520 (ICE-UB), FONDECYT No 11150014 (CONICYT-Chile), and the PDSE program CAPES/Brazil process number 99999.004658/2014-00.;;56;33;43;1;11;MODESTUM LTD;LONDON;STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND;1305-8215;1305-8223;;EURASIA J MATH SCI T;Eurasia J.

This difficulty is linked to the fact that they have not coordinated the processes involved in terms of the quantifier.

A patterning of narratives of time can be glimpsed in which academics are trading slots of time: they surrender part of their time to service institutional demands in return for time spaces in which they can pursue their own academic interests. Accordingly, the concept of time-markets may be helpful in understanding the evolution of higher education systems in neoliberal environments more generally.;"[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England";;Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Ave Brasil 2140, Valparaiso, Chile.;carolina.guzman@uv.cl;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020;Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;;;;33;29;33;0;13;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0307-5079;1470-174X;;STUD HIGH EDUC;Stud.

The data source was 73,050 students who completed the College Student Experiences Questionnaire. The results from multiple regression and effect size analyses showed that the frequency of involvement in these good practices did not change over time. Variation in the scores of the three indicators across years and types of institution (doctoral-granting universities, comprehensive universities, liberal arts colleges) was minimal indicating a stable pattern with only random fluctuations during this 15 year period.;"Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA";;Koljatic, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.;;;;;;;41;30;31;1;22;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;;;HIGH EDUC;High.

Findings from a thematic analysis of 68 publications show that attention to prospective principals increased after the year 2000 and this was driven by four main concerns: underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities, principal supply and demand, the principalship as a school improvement lever, and the expansion of leadership posts in schools. Selected articles addressed three dimensions of the pathways before a person is first appointed to this post: (a) micro (individual's agency), (b) meso (preparation of prospective principals), and (c) macro (policies shaping access to the post). Across time and countries, pathways to the principalship are resourced by individuals' professional orientations and by contextual factors, formal pre-service preparation may be desirable but not always available or required, and policies frame a conceptualisation of the principalship that shapes the two previous dimensions. The internationalization of research on pathways to the principalship has brought to the forefront normative assumptions that should be critically challenged when considering how to recruit, develop, and support prospective school principals.;"[Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Educ Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flessa, Joseph] Univ Toronto, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada";;Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.;carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl;;;" [FB 003];  [1210762]";The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the ANID (grant number FB 003, Grant #1210762).;;126;0;0;0;0;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

It offers insights into students' voices, while uncovering what they want to learn and the drivers behind this decision. Semi-structured interviews revealed the power of the school socialisation process; for the majority of students, core curriculum subjects are fundamental. The factors that drive their decisions are life in, outside and beyond school, where the family context and socioeconomic inequality are ever-present. This study reinforces our understanding of the importance of listening to student voices when developing school curricula. It also furthers our understanding of what students want to learn in terms of school subjects.

This study analyses trends of socioeconomic segregation in Chile (1999-2018), considering a period with an absence of policies aimed at reducing segregation (1999-2007) and a later stage (2008-2015) when measures were implemented with the potential to affect the socioeconomic composition of schools. Results show that the segregation of both disadvantaged and wealthy students increased to extremely high levels during the first period, and has not shown signs of any significant decrease since then. The slight reduction observed in the second period is associated with changes regarding school fees in the private subsidised education sector rather than the selectivity status of the schools.

This study focuses on the contribution of school placement, controlling by motor functionality and receptive vocabulary, over several domains of participation. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 123 preadolescents and adolescents with CP, from both special and regular school systems of Chile. A quantitative approach was employed using standardised instruments (i.e. Life habits questionnaire, Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised, and Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised). Results suggest that preadolescents' participation is significantly predicted by motor functionality and receptive language in all domains of participation, but for interpersonal relationship and community. For adolescents, school placement explained a significant amount of the variance for mobility, responsibility, and community participation, besides the variability explained by motor functionality and receptive language. Attending special schools exerts a negative influence on some participation domains, including mobility, responsibility, community life and recreation. Our findings support the importance of considering inclusive educational programmes as a critical aspect to improve wellbeing of people with CP, while also furthering their rights of participation.;"[Perez-Salas, Claudia Paz] Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Barrio Univ S-N,2 Piso, Concepcion, Chile; [Ortega, Alonso] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Escuela Fonoaudiol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Ortega, Alonso] Univ Valparaiso, CIDCL, Valparaiso, Chile; [Parra, Victoria] Univ Catolica Temuco, Dept Infancia & Educ Basica, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile; [Rosenbaum, Peter] McMaster Univ, CanChild Ctr Childhood Disabil Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada";;Perez-Salas, CP (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Barrio Univ S-N,2 Piso, Concepcion, Chile.;cperezs@udec.cl;Rosenbaum, Peter/AAW-7913-2021;"Rosenbaum, Peter/0000-0001-6751-5613; Ortega, Alonso/0000-0001-8671-2735; Parra, Victoria/0000-0001-8870-2629";National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT), Proyecto Fondecyt [11110358];This research was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT), Proyecto Fondecyt 11110358.;;44;0;0;2;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1360-3116;1464-5173;;INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC;Int.

This article examines the effect of parental involvement on the Language and Mathematics performance of third grade students attending low-SES schools in Santiago de Chile. Multilevel linear regression models are used (individuals and school) along with variables related to academic performance. Results show that parents' educational expectations and perceived self-efficacy have a positive and significant effect on academic performance in Language and Mathematics. Parental involvement practices at home only affect performance in Language, although this finding is not conclusive. Estimates revealed that involvement practices at school are not statistically significant. The implications of these results are discussed considering their context: a country with the highest levels of family income inequality and one of the most segregated school choice models in the world.;"[Gubbins, Veronica] Univ Finis Terrae, Escuela Ciencias Familia, Santiago, Chile; [Otero, Gabriel] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Sociol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Otero, Gabriel] Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands";;Gubbins, V (corresponding author), Pedro de Valdivia 1509, Santiago 7500000, Chile.;"vgubbins@uft.cl; gabriel.otero@uva.nl";;"Otero, Gabriel/0000-0001-9768-5699; Gubbins, Veronica/0000-0003-2175-2941";"Fondecyt/Conicyt Program under Universidad Alberto Hurtado [11150098]; CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2017 [72180515]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]";We are grateful for the support of the Fondecyt/Conicyt Program under Project No 11150098, under the sponsorship of the Universidad Alberto Hurtado (2015-2016), the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009), and CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2017 - 72180515, in the production of this article.;;55;5;5;9;34;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-5698;1465-3400;;EDUC STUD-UK;Educ.

Gender and educational leadership practices in urban primary schools in Chile;EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Leadership; gender; schools; Chile";"INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERSHIP; MANAGEMENT; PRINCIPALS";What differences are there, according to teachers' opinions, in school leadership practices between male principals (MPs) and female principals (FPs) in urban primary schools in Chile? A national survey has been done to address this topic, which was answered by the principal and five teachers in 381 urban primary schools. Following Leithwood's school leadership four-category model, 14 practices were considered and measured. Data were analysed by statistical procedures, including the decision tree technique, chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID). Findings showed that in 9 out of 14 practices, FPs have a significantly more favourable evaluation from teachers. Data confirmed that, when compared to other personal traits of principals or school features, gender is the strongest independent variable related with leadership practices. Nonetheless, this advantage occurs in an overall scenario in which both FPs and MPs engage unevenly with the leadership practices across the dimensions of the model. This study does not aim to explain the female advantage, but to show the shape of leadership differences by gender regarding theoretically relevant practices. Nevertheless, its data allow ruling out some possible hypotheses for interpreting those differences. The article suggests that further research is needed to theoretically explain the reasons behind differences in leadership practice by FPs and MPs.;"[Weinstein, Jose; Sembler, Matias] Univ Diego Portales, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile; [Weinstein, Marisa] ECLAC Div Gender Affairs, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Valenzuela, Paulina] Datavoz, Providencia, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Providencia, Chile";;Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile.;jose.weinstein@gmail.com;;"Marfan, Javiera/0000-0002-4627-8820; weinstein, jose/0000-0002-4193-4550; Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841";;;;61;0;0;1;4;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

J;"Carrasco, A; Gunter, HM";;;;"Carrasco, Alejandro; Gunter, Helen M.";;;The private in the privatisation of schools: the case of Chile;EDUCATIONAL REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Privatisation; Chile; voucher schools; Inclusion Law";;Privatisation of public services education is a key feature of the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM), where policy convictions, ideas, and strategies are integral to the spreading and mutating of reforms. While there are important projects that seek to describe and explain major changes to restructuring, ownership and funding, what has not been given sufficient attention is the role of the private in privatisation. By private, we mean the decisions and choices regarding educational services of (a) individuals and families and (b) school providers, and how issues that have traditionally been in the public domain (e.g. through government systems, on the agendas of local community/municipal schools) are no longer there (e.g. government systems have been dismantled and replaced with new providers, and local community/municipal schools either no longer exist or provide safety nets for those who fail in the market). What we intend focusing on is depoliticised privatism, where the role of the private in the supply and demand for school places illuminates a shift in the identification and addressing of educational matters from the politicised public to the depoliticised private domain. We report specifically on intellectual and empirical work regarding how supply and demand works in the provision of education services in Chile, particularly by looking at how those who own and work in schools view current reforms.;"[Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gunter, Helen M.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Educ, Manchester, Lancs, England";;Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackena 4860, Santiago, Chile.;ajcarras@uc.cl;;;"ESRC Newton Fund [ES/N000676/1]; CONICYT-ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/N000676/1] Funding Source: UKRI";We are grateful to ESRC Newton Fund for supporting The new private educational sector in Chile: entrepreneurialism and competition project (ES/N000676/1) from which this article derived, as well as to CONICYT-Chile for supporting this collaborative interchange.

Most scholars recommend addressing these problems by awarding individual grades, computing some kind of individual weighting factor (IWF) from peer and (sometimes) self-assessments, which is then multiplied by the group grade to generate an individual grade. Several variants of the IWF method have been proposed, sometimes with complex algorithms. However, theory suggests they are inaccurate and their accuracy has not been evaluated. This article uses Monte Carlo experiments to assess the accuracy of the original IWF method and variants proposed in the past decade. Findings show that the earlier, simpler methods work best and that self-assessments should definitely be avoided.;"[Guzman, Sebastian G.] West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, W Chester, PA 19380 USA; [Guzman, Sebastian G.] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile";;"Guzman, SG (corresponding author), West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, W Chester, PA 19380 USA.; Guzman, SG (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.";sguzman@wcupa.edu;;;Universidad Andres Bello [DI-798-15/JM];This work was supported by Universidad Andres Bello [grant number DI-798-15/JM].;;24;0;0;1;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0260-2938;1469-297X;;ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU;Assess.

The results question previous evidence about a common repertoire of effective leadership practices and suggest that local context will affect the type of leadership that is required for a specific educational system to improve, and therefore the definition of principals' effective practices. For Chile, the article points out that the principals' leadership practices that contribute the most to improve teacher performance are those related to ensuring that teachers' work and professional development are in accordance with the teaching goals of the school, as well as monitoring student work and classroom activities. Nevertheless, Chilean principals are more likely to get involved in the former practices (related to the school teaching goals) than in those related to teachers' work in the classroom, resulting in their actions being more powerful in mobilizing teachers' attitudes and professional practices than their teaching, which reduces their potential to promote teachers' performance. The results have implications for educational leadership research and policy making, especially in non-Anglo-American countries.;"[Marfan, Javiera; Pascual, Javier] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Minist Educ Chile, Gen Educ Div, Sch Leadership, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera; Pascual, Javier] Fdn Chile, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Santiago, Chile; [Pascual, Javier] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Pedag Dept, Res Grp Divers & Inclus Complex Soc, Barcelona, Spain; [Pascual, Javier] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain";;Marfan, J (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 1371,Of 500, Santiago 8340523, Chile.;javimarfan@gmail.com;pascual, javier/M-5964-2019;"pascual, javier/0000-0002-1900-7099; Marfan, Javiera/0000-0002-4627-8820; Pascual, Javier/0000-0001-6850-7391";Fund for Research and Development in Education (FONIDE) by the Ministry of Education of Chile [FE11140];This work was supported by the Fund for Research and Development in Education (FONIDE) No FE11140, provided by the Ministry of Education of Chile.;;40;8;8;2;17;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1741-1432;1741-1440;;EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD;Educ.

The empirical strategy is based on the fact that schools are ranked according to their position on a set of thresholds. We used a generalization of the traditional regression discontinuity design for the case where treatment assignment is determined by n variables. To gather information on teacher policies and practices, we conducted a survey of 4th-grade teachers in the Greater Santiago area. The results indicate that low-performing schools responded to the treatment by implementing policies that seek to improve their results in the short term. We also found no significant effects on teaching practices, suggesting that many of these changes are implemented top down from the school administrators, without involving teachers in the process.;"[Elacqua, Gregory; Martinez, Matias; Santos, Humberto] Univ Diego Portales, Publ Policy Inst, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Urbina, Daniela] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Urbina, Daniela] Princeton Univ, Off Populat Res, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";;Elacqua, G (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Publ Policy Inst, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.;gregory.elacqua@udp.cl;Martinez, Matias/AAI-9738-2020;Martinez, Matias/0000-0001-9838-1013;"Fund for Research in Education of PREAL (Programa de Promocion de la Reforma Educativa en America Latina y el Caribe); Proyecto de Iniciacion en Investigacion FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11121650]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)";This research was supported by the Fund for Research in Education of PREAL (Programa de Promocion de la Reforma Educativa en America Latina y el Caribe) and Proyecto de Iniciacion en Investigacion FONDECYT No 11121650, Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT).;;65;5;7;0;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0924-3453;1744-5124;;SCH EFF SCH IMPROV;Sch.

First, it presents the distraction and focus of attention problems that arise while using computer technology with off-the-shelf software for supporting different activities which take place in usual lectures. Examples of these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion, individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion of CiC. The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage of both this system and standard software are compared and research results are presented.

The study advances the hypothesis that emotional competences and classroom climate are mediators in school achievement. For this purpose, 420 students from secondary and further education were selected with an average age of 14.29 +/- 1.52. In emotional competence, the results showed differences according to gender and educational level, while in classroom climate, differences were only found according to educational level. The mediational analysis showed that classroom climate is an influential variable in the predictive value of emotional competence in relation to school achievement. Likewise, emotional competence acts as a mediating influence on classroom climate and school achievement. This study thus highlights the need to implement training processes to help teachers to promote positive socio-emotional contexts and programmes to develop students' emotional competence, which will improve their school achievement.;"[Lopez-Gonzalez, Luis] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Oriol, Xavier] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile";;Lopez-Gonzalez, L (corresponding author), Av Bellamar 12-14,Bloque C,Escalera 1,1-1a, Barcelona, Spain.;luislopez@programatreva.com;Granado, Xavier Oriol/AAO-3112-2021;Granado, Xavier Oriol/0000-0001-7130-7729;;;;82;24;25;25;165;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC;Cult.

The strategy aimed at generating conditions fostering individual and collective learning in educational complex adaptive systems, and led the design of the course through an iterative and adaptive process informed by evidence emerging from course dynamics. The data collected indicate that collaboration was initially challenging for students, but collective learning emerged as the course developed, positively affecting individual and team performance. Even though challenged, students felt highly motivated and enjoyed working on course activities. Their perception of progress and expertise were always high, and the academic performance was on average very good.

We see an emergent opportunity to contribute to the current discussion on transdisciplinarity and its institutionalization at universities. Our specific interest in this paper is to disentangle the conditions under which transdisciplinarity is developed in Latin American contexts and how it can be better implemented within those contexts. Our study focuses on the context of Latin American Public Universities. We examine the following research questions: (i) How is transdisciplinarity conceptualized in university policy and what are the conditions for its institutionalization? (ii) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006-2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of situated transdisciplinarity that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes. We conclude that the concept of situated transdisciplinarity can orient transdisciplinary research policy, by problematizing discourses and perceptions.;"[Salvador Riveros, Pablo; Merino, Jaqueline; Crespo, Francisco] Univ Chile, Unidad Redes Transdisciplinarias Vicerrectoria In, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Baptista, Bianca Vienni] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Transdisciplinar Lab, Univ Str 16,CHN K76-2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland";;Riveros, PS (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Unidad Redes Transdisciplinarias Vicerrectoria In, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.;"priveros@uchile.cl; jaqueline.merino@uchile.cl; francisco.crespo@uchile.cl; bianca.vienni@usys.ethz.ch";;Vienni Baptista, Bianca/0000-0003-1282-4288;;;;95;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

In the last few years, the University of Santiago de Chile has implemented a program of English Blended Learning in arcareers of eight faculties, whose objective is to develop linguistic and communicative skills at an intermediate level. For this purpose, the program consists of three pedagogical components: classrooms lessons, tutoring and an on-line platform. At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, a process evaluation was carried out that sought to know, from the perspective of those immediately involved, how the program had been implemented, emphasizing the progress towards the fulfillment of its objectives. The data collection considered three techniques: a survey about the learning experience of the students (N = 780), a focus group with the teachers of the program and semi-structured interviews with coordinators or heads of the University. The main findings show a positive evaluation of the program when each component is observed by itself. However, the analysis of the integration between these reveals four critical tensions related to: the guidance on autonomous work, the managing of the assignment of tutorials, the transition from the pedagogical contents of the platform to the class and the functional differentiation between the components of the program.;"[Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Univ Santiago Chile, Polit Equidad & Programas Inclus Educ Super, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Linguist & Literatura, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Univ Santiago Chile, Area Evaluat VRA, Santiago, Chile; [Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Perpetua Freire 821, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Pica 1031, Santiago, Chile";;"Lenta, RM (corresponding author), Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France.; Lenta, RM (corresponding author), 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France.";"rodolfo.martinic@gmail.com; sergio.urzua@usach.cl; ricardo.ubeda@usach.cl; roxana.aranda@usach.cl";;;;;;31;0;0;5;9;ASOC IBEROAMERICANA EDUCACION SUPERIOR DISTANCIA;MADRID;UNED, FAC EDUC, C/ JUAN DEL ROSAI, 14, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1138-2783;1390-3306;;RIED-REV IBEROAM EDU;RIED-Rev.

It firstly offers an overview of the considerable empirical literature around teaching-especially conceptions of teaching, approaches to teaching and teaching practices-and goes on to pose some philosophical and social theoretical considerations that open further the territory around teaching in university. Against this background, we propose the concept of 'horizons of teaching'. Horizons of teaching provide a context in which it makes sense for teachers to give themselves to the teaching enterprise and to go on giving themselves to teaching. Horizons include diverse and intricate layers at both micro- and macro-levels that interact in a permanent and dynamic way; they involve persons and collectivities; and they concern structures and agency. The paper concludes by proposing that horizons of teaching configure and delineate curricula and the pedagogical relationship in a way that might contain a revolutionary potentiality in recasting teaching in higher education.";"[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.;"r.barnett@ioe.ac.uk; carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl";", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020";Guzmán-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X;"PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]";We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

The results indicate that being a bully or a bully-victim increases the probability of being a low performing student. For the case of victims, our results suggest a heterogeneity according students' ability, decreasing academic achievement for students with below average ability, but increasing it for very high achieving students. We also found that students claiming to belong to a subculture characterized by a defiant attitude towards authority have lower academic achievement. Our results support anti-bullying policies and those attempting to promote student's identities associated with higher academic achievement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This report compares the development and impact of those policies within three main areas in both countries, namely: (1) trends and characteristics of the growing private higher education sector, (2) commercialisation and business-like trends that private academia is experiencing and, finally, (3) it discusses how all this has created tensioning situations with assessment and accrediting agencies to ensure quality in their private higher education systems. This study shows that private higher education is facing the following challenges in both nations: (1) an uncritical implementation of neoliberal policies, (2) that there is a very unregulated legislation that has allowed many private institutions to profit within loopholes in the law, (3) that quality has become a central concern and some of the mechanisms applied to correct it have not been effective, showing a lack of a comprehensive system of quality assessment, and (4) that enrolment has grown but with several mismatches that challenge the initial goal of advancing economic development through human resources capacities.

However, neither of these perspectives gives much consideration to the teaching framework in which the computer is actually used. In order to address this issue, a case study was designed to explore teachers' concepts and beliefs about computers. In this case study two teachers were involved in a software development process, and observation of their discussions during this process was used as a technique to uncover the teachers' beliefs about using computers. The case study led to a model of how teachers use computers in classroom teaching. This model conceptualizes the computer as a teaching resource that helps teachers to develop their teaching strategy, replacing the teachers in their role of managing students' rehearsal of materials and serving as a classroom management tool. This model of using computers demonstrates significant links between teachers' teaching strategies and the use of computers in education and thereby provides a support for a view of computers as professional tools for educators.;"Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, London WC1H 0AL, England; Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile";;Mellar, H (corresponding author), Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.;;"Hinostroza, J.

Drawing on Freidson's work on professionalism in the field of sociology of professions, our typology highlights four models of regulation - the 'market', the 'rules', the 'training', and the 'professional skills' models. We discuss how these models, embedded in a bureaucratic, market-oriented or professional approach, shape the regulation of the teaching profession and teachers' work in different contexts.

A survey was administered to a representative sample of 672 parents and guardians of students attending primary schools located in Santiago, Chile. The analyses conducted, based on OLS regression models with municipality-level fixed effects, reveal that parents' educational expectations and perceived self-efficacy behave as relevant predictors of their degree of involvement at home and at school respectively, even attenuating the importance of socioeconomic status (SES). However, results stress the importance of the information provided by the school, especially due to its impact on parents' involvement at home and on their participation in curricular school activities.

Currently, resources for ensuring the quality of service-learning experiences are scarce and often not validated. This paper describes the procedure followed for the design of the Questionnaire for Self-Assessment of University Service-Learning Experiences and its validation using the modified Delphi method online, which is a qualitative technique that aims to provide a reliable group response. In this study, two rounds of consultation were conducted by email, involving 16 academic experts who assessed the relevance and clarity of the items. While the first round of consultation aimed to analyze the relevance and clarity of all items, in the second round the clarity of the items which had been reformulated was analyzed. Results on the construct and content validity suggested the elimination or reformulation of some of the initial items. The final questionnaire was composed of 41 relevant and clear items, which are estimated through a 5 point Likert scale. Finally, two possible ways of giving continuity to this work are presented: to the opinion of experts who participate in service-learning but are not academic in the validation process; and to undertake a psychometric validation of the questionnaire through intra-test and inter-test methods.";"[Lopez-de-Arana Prado, Elena] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Educ & Deporte, Dept Didact & Org Escolar, Juan Ibanez Sto Domingo 1, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Aramburuzabala Higuera, Pilar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Formac Profesorado & Educ, Dept Didact & Teoria Educ, Francisco Tomas & Valiente 3, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Opazo Carvajal, Hector] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Ctr Estudios Educ & Aprendizaje Basado Comunida, Gen Jofre 462, Santiago, Chile";;Prado, ELDA (corresponding author), Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Educ & Deporte, Dept Didact & Org Escolar, Juan Ibanez Sto Domingo 1, Vitoria 01006, Spain.;"elena.lopezdearana@ehu.eus; pilar.aramburuzabala@uam.es; hopazo@ucsh.cl";;;;;;65;1;1;4;22;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

This study analysed the explanations provided by student teachers in STEM areas from a socio-materiality perspective focused on verbal and nonverbal language and representations. The study was conducted in a hybrid research format by scholars and a preservice teacher. First, the study compared the representational elements used by 86 student teachers to construct explanations about various concepts in a roleplay setting. Next, a positioning analysis was done by a preservice teacher, to a selection of five of these explanations focused on the concept of force. The positioning analysis highlighted the embedded voices in the construction of explanations, with a focus on the intersection between science and language. The results showed that the student teachers created explanations as static artefacts, mainly using examples, graphs and images to clarify the concepts. The voices of learners and scientists were mostly absent from the explanations, which led to the presentation of explanations in STEM areas as finished and unquestionable artefacts, with references neither to nature nor to the history of science. We reflect on the meanings attributed to learning to be a practitioner in the context of interconnecting science and language through explanations, as a process of meaning (re)production within the classroom. Implications for teacher education are discussed in order to enhance student teachers' awareness about constructing knowledge by enacting explanations in the science classroom.;"[Cabello, Valeria M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Real, Constanza] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile; [Impedovo, Maria Antonietta] Aix Marseille Univ, ADEF, Marseille, France";;Cabello, VM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.;"vmcabello@uc.cl; constanza.real@ug.uchile.cl; maria-antonietta.IMPEDOVO@univ-amu.fr";"Cabello, Valeria M./AAA-1012-2019; impedovo, maria/L-6471-2016";"Cabello, Valeria M./0000-0001-6190-9187; impedovo, maria/0000-0003-2172-7105";"CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional [REDES180109]; Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion";This work was financially supported by CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional REDES180109, Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion.;;67;0;0;1;27;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0157-244X;1573-1898;;RES SCI EDUC;Res.

MOOCs represent an evolution towards the production and offering of structured quality OER. Many institutions that were initially reluctant to providing OER have, however, joined the MOOC wave. Nevertheless, MOOCs detractors strongly criticize their high dropout rates. The dropout rate is a commonly accepted metric of success for traditional education, but it may not be as suitable when dealing with OER, in general, and with MOOCs, in particular, since learners' motivations to take a course are very diverse, and certain selfregulated learning strategies are required to tackle the lack of personalized tutoring and keep pace in the course. This paper presents an empirical study on the motivation and learning strategies of MOOC learners. Six thousand three hundred and thirty-five learners from 160 countries answered a selfreport 7-point Likert-type questionnaire based on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) as part of a MOOC titled Introduction to Programming with Java. Results indicate that learners were highly motivated and confident to do well in the course.

The research is embedded in the theoretical framework of Anthropological Theory of Didactics (Chevallard 1999), particularly important is its concept of << praxeology >>. Based on the result of the analysis, the article establishes a didactical phenomenon to be named << the demathematisation of recommendations for the teaching of high-school physics >> in Chile.

It arises from a line of research at the University Pablo de Olavide (Seville) and developed at the Laboratory for Computational Intelligence (LCI). (R) EduTool is developed under the auspices of the UNE 66181 standard, while at the LCI, the significance of the sub-factors for each of the dimensions (recognition of training, learning methodology and levels of accessibility) of this standard for Quality Management of Virtual Training for MOOC have been analyzed using fuzzy logic. In this sense, aggregation of the linguistic variables of 10 experts was performed using the probabilistic OR function and they were defuzzyfied using the centroid method to calculate these weights. To measure the quality of the courses, we proceded to find and select relevant MOOC platforms: Udacity, EDX, MiriadaX and Coursera. Subsequently, the most relevant MOOCs related to computers and computer science categories were selected by intentional non-probability sampling. For this data collection method, two engineers accessed these MOOC platforms to code and assessing the quality of these courses using EduTool (R). In general, the analytical and graphic results show that the quality of the average MOOCs analyzed in each platform is located above the score that describes the required minimum (50 %). In this sense, a higher average quality was appreciated in Coursera (66.34%) and EDX platform (62.62 %), intermediate in the Udacity platform (54.92%) and somewhat lower in the MiriadaX platform (50.40%).;"[Baldomero Ramirez-Fernandez, Miguel; Salmeron Silvera, Jose Luis] Univ Pablo Olavide Sevilla, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Salmeron Silvera, Jose Luis] Univ Autonoma Chile, Temuco 4810101, Novena Region D, Chile";;Ramirez-Fernandez, MB (corresponding author), Univ Pablo Olavide Sevilla, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.;"mbramfer@upo.es; salmeron@acm.org";;;;;;35;2;2;0;49;UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA;MADRID;PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN;1139-613X;2174-5374;;EDUC XX1;Educ.

In the first part we define and characterise the concepts of teachers' identity and self together with critical incident, which is optimum to reach the teacher's self. In the second part, we present a descriptive case study dealing with the relationships between the identity and self of two university teachers. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the existing level of coherence between the characteristics of the teacher's identity and his/her real teaching performance (self). On the other hand, the study presents evidence on how teachers act when faced with critical incidents and how they change to adjust to the conflict situation. Finally, we address the potential and limitations of using critical incidents as a methodological research tool in this study field and in teacher training.;"[Monereo, Carles] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Dep Psicol Basica Evolut & Educ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Badia, Antoni] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Bilbao, Gilda] Univ Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; [Cerrato, Maria; Weise, Crista] Univ Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain";;Monereo, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Dep Psicol Basica Evolut & Educ, Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.;carles.monereo@uab.cat;"Badia, Antoni/K-2640-2017; Monereo, Carles/AAN-9824-2021; weise, crista/M-9855-2019; Monereo, Carles/J-9844-2017; Font, Carles Monereo/ABF-5247-2020";"Badia, Antoni/0000-0003-1294-8061; Monereo, Carles/0000-0001-7447-985X; weise, crista/0000-0003-2491-554X; Cerrato Lara, Maria/0000-0002-3253-9866";;;;29;13;21;0;17;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1135-6405;1578-4118;;CULT EDUC;Cult.

Given that dozens of countries across the world are purchasing computers for their students, we ask which elements are necessary to improve learning when introducing digital resources into the classroom. Understood the orchestration as the coordination of conventional and digital resources, we examine whether effective resource orchestration improves student learning. To do so, an 8-month study was undertaken across 17 schools in Uruguay, involving 544 fourth grade students. A treatment group worked under an orchestrated strategy, while a control group followed the national strategy, which includes the One Laptop per Child Computer (XO). Our study confirmed that the national strategy alone is capable of producing significant progress in student learning. However, we also found that the orchestration produces a statistically significant improvement in the results when compared to the control group. The main finding indicates that when teachers have an orchestrated strategy to integrate digital and non-digital resources, student learning is enhanced in relation to the curricular objectives. Finally, we discovered that learning is improved in the treatment group when there is systematic use of resources, and when the school's infrastructure facilitates the use of the technology.;"[Diaz, A.; Nussbaum, M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Varela, I.] Univ Catolica Uruguay, Fac Ciencias Humanas, Montevideo, Uruguay";;Diaz, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comp Sci, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile.;akdiaz@puc.cl;Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013;"Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Varela, Isabel/0000-0002-4007-9388";"Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice from Chile [CIE01-CONICYT]; Proyecto Ceibal of the Government of Uruguay; Universidad Catolica de Uruguay";The research was supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Grant CIE01-CONICYT, from Chile, Proyecto Ceibal of the Government of Uruguay and Universidad Catolica de Uruguay.;;22;4;4;2;17;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4909;1365-2729;;J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR;J.

In particular, it examines the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on track placement (general or vocational), and gaps in higher education access between graduates from both tracks. Result suggests that in a highly socially differentiated education system such as the Chilean one, within-school tracking diminishes SES segregation between tracks. However, the study does not provide evidence that this specific form of tracking mitigates inequalities between tracks, as measured by access to higher education. Considering only the direct effects of tracking operating through instructional and institutional mechanisms, the access gap between general and vocational tracks increases instead of narrowing. The implications for future research are discussed in light of these finding.;"[Sevilla, Maria Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Polesel, John] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Vocat & Educ Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";;Sevilla, MP (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.;msevilla@uahurtado.cl;;"Polesel, John/0000-0003-1752-0849; Sevilla, Maria Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272";"ANID/FONDECYT Iniciacion [11170547]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [ANID/FONDAP/15130009]";We thank the comments of generous reviewers, who provided us with essential insights.

Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to the social class background of university faculty and how it might affect their pathways to the professoriate and their opportunities to access high-paying positions. We attempted to address this gap in the literature by looking at a sample of faculty working at Chilean universities. We used a path analysis approach to estimate not only the direct effects of social class of origin on income but also the indirect mechanisms through which social class of origin influences faculty income. We posed two alternative conceptual perspectives with regard to the effects of social class on income-social reproduction and human capital. We found that faculty who come from the upper social class have access to higher-quality undergraduate education and to more prestigious PhD-granting universities and they report higher earnings as compared with those who come from a low social class. These findings resemble a dynamic of cumulative educational advantages that provides grounds to the theory of social reproduction. Although it could be argued that the positive effect of prestige of the PhD-granting university on income is in line with the human capital theory, we claim that such effect cannot be analyzed independently from the direct and indirect relationships that exist between social class of origin and the prestige of the university from which faculty obtained their doctorate degrees.;"[Chiappa, Roxana] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Miller Hall,2012 Skagit Ln, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Perez Mejias, Paulina] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile";;Mejias, PP (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.;"rchiappa@uw.edu; paulina.perez@ciae.uchile.cl";"Mejias, Paulina Perez/AAV-3206-2021; Perez Mejias, Paulina/O-7600-2017";"Chiappa Baros, Roxana/0000-0002-3523-1197; Perez Mejias, Paulina/0000-0002-8024-4843";;;;85;2;2;0;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0018-1560;1573-174X;;HIGH EDUC;High.

However, there are students who, despite living in impoverished conditions, achieve solid academic performance. How they do so is a question of central importance. The present study uses the concept of resilience as a theoretical framework that can help us to answer it. It investigates various characteristics common to the students, families, and schools of Chile, and places emphasis on understanding resilience as it relates to the academic achievement of students with low SES. Multilevel models and comparisons reveal performance determinants associated with resilience, such as reading engagement and schooling conditions. This study highlights resilience as a framework for addressing the obstacles that face disadvantaged youth in developing educational systems.;"[Vera, Gabriela Gomez; Vlenzuela, Juan Pablo; Sotomayor, Carmen] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Vera, Gabriela Gomez] Univ Bourgogne, F-21004 Dijon, France; [Vlenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Fac Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Sotomayor, Carmen] Univ Chile, Fac Philosophy & Humanities, Santiago, Chile";;Vera, GG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile.;"gabriela.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl; jpvalenzuela@ciae.uchile.cl; csotomayor@ciae.uchile.cl";, CIAE/R-5423-2017;Gomez Vera, Gabriela/0000-0002-6842-3953;"PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy [79112008]; University of Chile";The authors would like to thank CER editors and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript.
