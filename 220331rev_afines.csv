These effects were studied using a sample of 1274 students from economically disadvantaged schools in Chile. The videogames were specifically designed to address the educational goals of the first and second years of school, for basic mathematics and reading comprehension. The sample was divided into experimental groups (EG), internal control groups (IC) and external control groups (EC). Students in the EG groups, used the experimental video games during an average of 30 h over a 3-month period. They were evaluated on their acquisition of reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematical skills, and on their motivation to use video games. Teachers' expectations of change due to the use of video games, their technological transfer, and handling of classroom dynamics, were assessed through ad hoc tests and classroom observations. The results show significant differences between the EG and IC groups in relation to the EC group in Math, Reading Comprehension and Spelling, but no significant differences in these aspects were found between the EG and the IC groups. Teacher reports and classroom observations confirm an improvement in motivation to learn, and a positive technological transfer of the experimental tool. Although further studies regarding the effects of learning through videogame use are imperative, positive effects on motivation and classroom dynamics, indicate that the introduction of educational video games can be a useful tool in promoting learning within the classroom. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,,"98-1552; 1000520, C-13595; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1980573","The study presented in this article forms part and was financed by the following research and development projects: FONDEF D9611016, FONDECYT 1980573, FONTEC 98-1552, Fundación Andes C-13595 and FONDECYT 1000520.

This article reports the results of an extended collaborative action research project in which teachers attempted to create the conditions for such dialogue by adopting an inquiry approach to the curriculum. A quantitative comparison between observations made early and late in the teachers' involvement in the project showed a number of significant changes in the characteristics of teacher-whole-class discourse, with a shift toward a more dialogic mode of interaction. Nevertheless, the initiation-response-follow-up (IRF) genre continued to be pervasive. Despite this, when the same observations were examined qualitatively, there was clear evidence of an increase over time in the teachers' adoption of a ""dialogic stance."" The article concludes with a consideration of the relationship between the choice of discourse formats and the enactment of a dialogic stance.

In affective computing, affect is often taken to be another kind of information-discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computational systems and back. While affective computing explicitly challenges the primacy of rationality in cognitivist accounts of human activity, at a deeper level it often relies on and reproduces the same information-processing model of cognition. Drawing on cultural, social, and interactional critiques of cognition which have arisen in human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as anthropological and historical accounts of emotion, we explore an alternative perspective on emotion as interaction: dynamic, culturally mediated, and socially constructed and experienced. We demonstrate how this model leads to new goals for affective systems-instead of sensing and transmitting emotion, systems should support human users in understanding, interpreting, and experiencing emotion in its full complexity and ambiguity. In developing from emotion as objective, externally measurable unit to emotion as experience, evaluation, too, alters focus from externally tracking the circulation of emotional information to co-interpreting emotions as they are made in interaction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This supports the theorization of learning as a socio-cultural practice, framed by Vygotsky and developed by other researchers such as Rogoff, Lave and Wenger. However, there is also evidence that working collaboratively may not be a spontaneous response to working in a group, and that teaching learners how to collaborate, and in particular how to work together to negotiate meaning, is a necessary part of the process of learning collaboratively which can enhance outcomes further. A question for the computer supported collaborative learning community then arises as to whether learning to collaborate can be scaffolded through the use of digital tools, and what such tools might look like. This paper reports on the design of a digital system that aims to support the practice of face-to-face collaboration on open-ended tasks. Findings from trials of the system in classrooms in the UK and Chile show that the model is welcomed both by teachers and pupils, and met its objectives of ensuring greater interaction between class members who did not normally work together, and involvement of all individuals in discussion based activities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil","In this paper, we initially discuss the relationships among physical, mathematical, and mental models in the process of constructing and understanding physical theories. We adopt the assumption that comprehension in a particular field of physics is attained when it is possible to predict a physical phenomenon from its physical models without having to previously refer to the mathematical formalism. The physical models constitute the semantic structure of a physical theory and determine the way the classes of phenomena linked to them should be ""perceived."" Within this framework, the first step in order to understand a phenomenon or a process in physics is to construct mental models that will allow the individual to understand the statements that compose the semantic structure of the theory, being necessary, at the same time, to modify the way of perceiving the phenomena by constructing mental models that will permit him to evaluate as true or false the descriptions the theory makes of them. When this double process is attained concerning a particular phenomenon, in such a way that the ""results"" of the constructed mental models (predictions and explanations) match those scientifically accepted, one can say that the individual has constructed an adequate mental model of the physical model of the theory. Then, in the light of this discussion, we attempt to interpret the research findings we have obtained so far with college students, regarding mental models and physics education under the framework of Johnson-Laird's mental model theory. The difficulties faced by the students to achieve the understanding of physical theories did not seem to be all of the same level: some are linked to the constraints imposed to the construction of mental models by students' previous knowledge and others, linked to the ways individuals perceive the world, seem to be much more problematic. We argue that teaching should focus on them, at least at introductory level, considering the explicit teaching of the modelling process - or at least its systematic practice - as a tool that might be appropriate to facilitate this process. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036116586

The IIRM are educational software components, specializing in mathematical concepts, presented through recreational mathematics, conceived as interactive, recreation-oriented learning objects, integrated within the environment. We present the architecture of the learning environment which integrates communication services that support the interaction processes of the learning community, through instant messaging, chat rooms, and multi-player math games. Through the environment's interface of their personal workspace, students have access to several easy-to-use mechanisms that allows them to customize its content, its layout, and its appearance. At internal levels, the functionality of IIRM is enhanced with features supported by the environment infrastructure. We evaluated different aspects of the learning environment in three short, motivation-oriented math courses given to Mexican high-school students. The results indicate that the use of the IIRM-based electronic learning environment, positively affects student attitudes towards mathematics. We believe that this approach has the potential to promote the mathematics learning process, basically on its motivational aspects. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared group and individual feedback, using two technologies: (1) Technology-mediated, Peer-Assisted Learning (TechPALS), which uses wireless handheld technology to structure feedback in small groups as they solve fractions problems and (2) a popular desktop product, which provides feedback to individual students as they solve fractions problems individually. Three elementary schools participated in a randomized controlled experiment conducted in the 2007-2008 school year. Students in the TechPALS condition learned more than did the control group students, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.14 to d = 0.44. Analysis of observational data confirmed that students in the TechPALS condition participated socially in questioning, explaining, and discussing disagreements, whereas students in the individual condition did not. We conclude that an integration of technology, cooperative activity designs and broader educational practices can lead to impact on students' mathematics learning. © 2009 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Cooperative learning; Feedback; Fractions; Group feedback; Handheld computers; Mathematics; Wireless networking",,"D04T2036; U.S. Department of Education, ED; Institute of Education Sciences, IES; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica, FONDECYT: 1080100","Acknowledgements The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education.

In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed that assists in the design and classroom integration of educational games. The framework addresses both the educational dimension and the ludic dimension. The educational dimension employs Bloom's revised taxonomy to define learning objectives and applies the classroom multiplayer presential game (CMPG) pedagogical model while the ludic dimension determines the gaming elements subject to constraints imposed by the educational dimension. With a view to validating the framework, a game for teaching electrostatics was designed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An evaluation based on pre/post testing found that the game increased the average number of correct answers by students participating in the experiment from 6.11 to 10.00, a result found to be statistically significant.

The resulting dissatisfaction with quantitative physical textbook problems seems to influence the attitude towards the role of mathematics in physics education in general. Mathematics is often seen as a tool for calculation which hinders a conceptual understanding of physical principles. However, the role of mathematics cannot be reduced to this technical aspect. Hence, instead of putting mathematics away we delve into the nature of physical science to reveal the strong conceptual relationship between mathematics and physics. Moreover, we suggest that, for both prospective teaching and further research, a focus on deeply exploring such interdependency can significantly improve the understanding of physics. To provide a suitable basis, we develop a new model which can be used for analysing different levels of mathematical reasoning within physics. It is also a guideline for shifting the attention from technical to structural mathematical skills while teaching physics. We demonstrate its applicability for analysing physical-mathematical reasoning processes with an example. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; European Social Fund, ESF; Freistaat Sachsen","Acknowledgments We would like to thank Ulrike Böhm for fruitful discussions, Edward Redish for his valuable remarks, as well as Brian Danielak and Eric Kuo for their help concerning language issues.

The research used a design experiment in which researchers significantly modified a secondary science methods course. The multiple data sources included: audiotaped conversations of two focus pairs of participants as they interacted with the software; written pre- and posttests on concepts of natural selection of the 21 prospective teachers; written pre- and posttests on views of the nature of science; three e-mail journal questions; and videotaped class discussions. Findings indicate that prospective teachers initially demonstrated alternative understandings of evolutionary concepts; there were uninformed understandings of the nature of scientific inquiry; there was little correlation between understandings and disciplines; and even the prospective teachers with research experience failed to understand the diverse methods used by scientists. Following the module there was evidence of enhanced understandings through metacognition, and the potential for interactive software to provide promising context for enhancing content understandings. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Evolutionary process; Metacognition; Scientific knowledge; Teachers; Computer software; Information analysis; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Research; Students; Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-23844462905

In the last decade, growing controversies and conflict have arisen in the region regarding the adoption of genetically modified crops and the growing use of glyphosate-based herbicides. Even if the industry and the World Health Organization claim that glyphosate is a product of low-toxicity, an increasing body of scientific research shows severe health problems for villagers and farmers. In Argentina, many peasants, neighbors, environmental activists, as well as rural physicians, scientists, agronomic engineers and lawyers have asked for a ban or strict limits on the use of glyphosate-based herbicides. Using a case study, I focus on collective action between 1996 and 2011 aimed at changing "" science-based regulations"" for the commercialization and use of agrochemicals. I demonstrate that by implementing diverse and innovative collective strategies as well as promoting the creation of new scientific data, affected populations can achieve some degree of influence on decisions regarding risk. Even if social and scientific disagreements over regulatory frameworks for biotechnology in Latin America have been acknowledged in the literature, regulatory science has rarely been thought of as a field of social struggle where social movements can participate and promote change.

We conjectured that these two different emphases could be fruitful combined in a research and development process aimed at producing effective CSCL practices. We explored this possibility in a project that adapted a CSCL tool from Chile to serve as the basis of an effective 3-week classroom module for primary school mathematics in the United States. To go from tool to module, we addressed curricular fit, training materials, pedagogical guidance, formative and summative assessments, and logistical support. In conducting the project, we found that effectiveness and contextual research could be conducted simultaneously and yielded complementary insight to this design process, which enabled our project to rapidly move from the base tool towards complete classroom modules. An experiment we conducted after our design iterations showed that students who used the modules learned more about the target content, fractions.

These defects in procedural knowledge have been described as functional fixedness and functional reduction. This article assesses the procedural difficulties of students (grade 12 and first and third year of university) based on common sense reasoning in two areas of chemistry, chemical equilibrium and geometry and polarity of molecules. In the first area, the theme of external factors affecting equilibria (temperature and concentration change) was selected because the explanations given by the students could be analyzed easily. The existence of a functional fixedness where Le Chatelier's principle was almost exclusively applied by rote could be observed, with this being the cause of the incorrect responses given to the proposed items. Functional fixedness of the Lewis structure also led to an incorrect prediction of molecular geometry. When molecular geometry was correctly determined by the students, it seemed that other methodological or procedural difficulties appeared when the task was to determine molecular polarity. The students showed a tendency, in many cases, to reduce the factors affecting molecular polarity in two possible ways: (a) assuming that polarity depends only on shape (""geometric functional reduction"") or (b) assuming that molecular polarity depends only on the polarity of bonds (""bonding functional reduction""). © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, the impact varies depending on whether students were enrolled in public or private schools. The authors designed an augmented reality application for students to practice the basic principles of geometry, and a similar application which encompasses identical learning objectives and content deployed in a Web-based learning environment. A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design was employed with 93 participants to investigate the effect of type of technology (web, augmented reality), type of school (private, public), and time of assessment (pre, post) on motivation, and declarative learning. The results show that: (1) there is an interactive effect of type of technology, type of school, and time of assessment when students' achievement scores are measured; (2) students using the augmented reality-based learning environments scored higher in post-test than those using the web-based application; (3) the augmented reality learning environment was more learning effective compared with the web-based learning environment in public schools, but not in private schools; (4) there is not an interactive effect of type of technology, type of school and time of assessment when students' motivation is measured; (5) students from private schools reported higher levels of motivation compared with those from public schools when using the augmented reality learning environment.

Previous research brought to light the multidimensional structure of reflective practice in medicine. It comprises at least five sets of behaviours in response to complex medical problems encountered in professional practice. Factors associated to reflective practice among physicians have, as far as we know, not yet been explored by empirical study. Purpose: To study factors correlated to reflective practice among physicians. Methods: A questionnaire exploring characteristics of professional practice and educational experiences was administered to primary health care physicians. Measurements were related to scores on a reflective practice measuring instrument developed previously. Associations between variables were examined by statistical analysis with tests of correlation and analysis of variance. Results: Reflective practice is negatively correlated to physician's age and number of years of clinical practice. Working mainly in hospitals and attendance to medical residency programmes in some specialties apparently have a positive effect on reflective practice. Conclusion: Reflective practice tends to decrease with experience. Findings are consistent with the literature on medical expertise that shows a decline of analytical reasoning in proportion to the increase in experience.

Frequency of computer use had, in general, a negative effect on the test results, and the negative effect increased for younger and poorer students. Computer ownership had, in general, a small positive effect on the test results for older students, and no effect for 4th graders. Internet access had a negative effect for younger and poorer students, and a positive effect for 11th graders.

The work devoted to excellence and deep learning by several authors has been carefully followed and considered. This communication reports research work on chemistry teaching, associated with those developments for first-year students. The work included the design of strategies and the adoption of teaching and learning activities exploring ways to stimulate active learning by improving the quality of classroom interactions. In addition to regular lectures, large classes' teaching based on student-generated questions was explored. In order to improve students' motivation and stimulate their curiosity, conference-lectures were adopted to deal with selected topics of wide scientific, technological and social interest. Quantitative analysis and discussion of selected case studies, together with the organization of laboratory classes based on selected enquiry-based experiments, planned and executed by students, stimulated deep learning processes.

In class B, the relationships were constructed in a friendly way from the very beginning. The positive emotions that contributed to raising positive background feelings occurred in a high number and frequency. In class A, the picture was completely different, with a higher number and frequency of negative emotions.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests - are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional competencies have been observed. Data and results are limited by structural bottlenecks in the educational and social system.

Hence, learning a manipulative task is generally more effective when watching animations that show natural motions of the task, rather than equivalent static pictures. The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found. Follow-up analyses indicated that females benefited more than males from using animated presentations.","Animation vs. static picture; Cognitive load theory; Embodied cognition; Gender differences; Technology-based learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948162700

The historical reconstruction of the periodic table showed that the periodicity of the elements could be construed as an inductive generalization or as a function of the atomic theory. There is considerable controversy with respect to the nature of Mendeleev's contribution, and various alternatives are discussed: ordered domain; empirical law; and a theory with limited explanatory power. Accommodation of the elements according to their physicochemical properties is considered to be the major contribution of the periodic table by all textbooks, followed by contra-predictions of previously unknown elements (30 textbooks), and novel predictions (corrections of atomic mass) of known elements (10 textbooks). The relative importance of accommodation and prediction within an HPS framework is generally ignored. Few textbooks have attempted to explore the possible cause of periodicity in the table and very few textbooks have explored the nature of Mendeleev's contribution. The development of the periodic table as a sequence of heuristic principles in the form of a convincing argument has been ignored. The textbook approach of emphasizing that the development of the periodic table was an inductive generalization, and that Mendeleev had no model or theory, does not facilitate the spirit of critical inquiry that led the scientists to grapple with alternative interpretations, conflicts, and controversies. It is concluded that the development of the periodic table went through a continual critical appraisal (conflict and controversy), in which scientists presented various tentative theoretical ideas to understand the observed phenomena. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Electrons; Heuristic methods; Mathematical models; Philosophical aspects; Physical chemistry; Societies and institutions; Textbooks; Atomic theory; Chemistry textbooks; History and philosophy of science (HPS); Periodic table; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444255188

The navigation problem consists of the four subproblems: world perception, path planning, path generation, and path tracking. This software based on ant colonies has two operational modes: virtual and on-line. In virtual mode, is able to achieve path generation, path planning and virtual path tracking at once, since the virtual mobile robots ""ants"" searches for the objective point generating feasible paths, then generate a set of subgoals to obtain the optimal path, since the optimal path was obtained using a cost function that considers the robot architecture, the optimal trajectory for the robot also is obtained. In on-line mode, the robot is able to sense the world using stereoscopic vision, the map is updated using epipolar geometry, and the on-line navigation problem is handled similar to the virtual mode. The software has many educational skills, since students can learn about path generation, optimal planning and path tracking using the heuristic methodology known as Ant Colony Optimization that recently has had good acceptance for solving discrete optimization planning problems.

Of all the participants in an MOOC, top contributors are the ones who more actively contribute via social tools. This article analyses and reports empirical data from five different social tools pertaining to an actual MOOC to characterize top contributors and provide some insights aimed at facilitating their early detection. The results of this analysis show that top contributors have better final scores than the rest. In addition, there is a moderate positive correlation between participants' overall performance (measured in terms of final scores) and the number of posts submitted to the five social tools. This article also studies the effect of participants' gender and scores as factors that can be used for the early detection of top contributors. The analysis shows that gender is not a good predictor and that taking the scores of the first assessment activities of each type (test and peer assessment in the case study) results in a prediction that is not substantially improved by adding subsequent activities.

When factors such as appeal, media, realism, size, and interaction are not tightly controlled between statics and animations, researchers may often be comparing apples with oranges. In this review, we provide a categorization of these confounding variables and offer some possible solutions to generate more tightly controlled studies.

However, the lack of tools supporting the authoring and automatic checking of exercises for specifics topics (e.g., geometry) drastically reduces advantages in the use of e-learning environments on a larger scale, as usually happens in Brazil. This paper describes an algorithm, and a tool based on it, designed for the authoring and automatic checking of geometry exercises. The algorithm dynamically compares the distances between the geometric objects of the student's solution and the template's solution, provided by the author of the exercise. Each solution is a geometric construction which is considered a function receiving geometric objects (input) and returning other geometric objects (output). Thus, for a given problem, if we know one function (construction) that solves the problem, we can compare it to any other function to check whether they are equivalent or not. Two functions are equivalent if, and only if, they have the same output when the same input is applied. If the student's solution is equivalent to the template's solution, then we consider the student's solution as a correct solution. Our software utility provides both authoring and checking tools to work directly on the Internet, together with learning management systems. These tools are implemented using the dynamic geometry software, iGeom, which has been used in a geometry course since 2004 and has a successful track record in the classroom. Empowered with these new features, iGeom simplifies teachers' tasks, solves non-trivial problems in student solutions and helps to increase student motivation by providing feedback in real time. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we examine the effect on student performance of the manipulation of the logical structure as well as of the M-demand of these problems. In addition, we study the relationship between student performance on the problems and a number of cognitive variables, viz., developmental level, working memory capacity, functional M-capacity and disembedding ability of students. In addition, we test the validity of the Johnstone-El-Banna model. Nine problems of varying number of operative schemata, as well as of varying number of M-demand, were used. The number of schemata varied from a minimum of two, to a maximum of four, while within each logical schema we had specific mental demand (M-demand), varying from four to six. As basic molecular-equilibrium schemata in these problems, we considered the following: (1) the process of establishment of chemical equilibrium; (2) the condition of chemical equilibrium; (3) the case of gaseous systems, with use of partial and total pressures as well as of Kp; and (4) the disturbance of equilibrium and the establishment of a new equilibrium. The correlation between student performance in the schemata and the steps of the problem solutions is low when the number of schemata is low, but high when this number is high. Of the cognitive factors studied, developmental level plays the most important role, especially as the logical structure of the problem increases. The other three cognitive variables also have an effect, with working memory capacity leading. The findings are mainly attributed to the fact that the problems were rather algorithmic exercises for the students, because of familiarity and training. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032372135

It is plausible to suggest that if the information is presented in differing formats, the cognitive demand of a problem changes. The main objective of this study is to investigate the degree to which cognitive variables, such as developmental level, mental capacity, and disembedding ability explain student performance on problems which: (1) could be addressed by algorithms or (2) require conceptual understanding. All conceptual problems used in this study were based on a figurative format. The results obtained show that in all four problems requiring algorithmic strategies, developmental level of the students is the best predictor of success. This could be attributed to the fact that these are basically computational problems, requiring mathematical transformations. Although all three problems requiring conceptual understanding had an important aspect in common (the figurative format), in all three the best predictor of success is a different cognitive variable. It was concluded that: (1) the ability to solve computational problems (based on algorithms) is not the major factor in predicting success in solving problems that require conceptual understanding; (2) solving problems based on algorithmic strategies requires formal operational reasoning to a certain degree; and (3) student difficulty in solving problems that require conceptual understanding could be attributed to different cognitive variables. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","cognitive variables; conceptual understanding algorithms; problem solving",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038846631

However, there is limited prior research investigating how to facilitate such integrated STEM learning in formal classrooms that go beyond a simple combination of the different subject areas and instead enable teaching and learning of disciplinary concepts infused with scientific inquiry, engineering design, mathematical reasoning, and 21st century technological skills. In this paper, we investigate the affordances of using an educational Computer Aided Design tool, Energy 3D, and corresponding curricular materials to support such integrated STEM learning anchored in the engineering design process. We present an exploratory case study that was conducted in a middle school in the US, where a project-based learning approach was followed and students were asked to design a low-cost energy-efficient home within a given budget using the Energy3D CAD tool. Findings indicate that students learned to engage in the design process and demonstrated practices of idea fluency and systematic experimentation; practices usually representative of informed designers. During the design process while analyzing the problem space, generating ideas, and evaluating solutions, they developed better understanding of the relationships between variables and underlying science concepts, used various mathematical analysis tools and graphical representations embedded in the available technology to inform their engineering design decisions. The learning environment using Energy3D afforded formative feedback to help students understand relationship between variables, provided converging evidences using multiple analytical tools, and enabled visual problem decomposition using suboptimal model to engage students in integrated STEM learning.

It does so by comparing the effect of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) on the digital skills of Chilean students compared with mathematics and language. This comparison is made using national standardized tests. The marginal effect of a group of variables measuring student ESCS was compared both as a whole and separately using multivariate linear regression analysis. The results show that the marginal effect of ESCS as a whole on students' digital skills was equal to the effect on mathematics and greater than the effect on language. Furthermore, the results show that the parents' level of education was the most relevant factor of ESCS for explaining student performance on the digital test, more so than for mathematics and language. These findings challenge the belief that the Internet would reduce economic, social and cultural inequalities in new generations. Instead, they reveal that the gap among Chilean students tends to perpetuate or widen when comparing performance in mathematics and language with performance in the digital domain. At the same time, by comparing national test results, this paper offers empirical evidence for the existence of a second digital divide in the field of education, a concept which is widely discussed at a theoretical level but with little empirical support to date. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital literacy; Digital skills test; Economic, social and cultural status; ICT; Second digital divide","Regression analysis; Digital divide; Digital literacies; Digital skills; Level of educations; Marginal effects; Multivariate linear regression analysis; Standardized tests; Student performance; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910636868

In order to increase the impact of our work on teachers' professional development, we implemented in 2007 ComPratica, an online network intended to establish a virtual community of practice involving biology teachers and biological education researchers. We present here the results of the first 2 years of this project, obtained through an analysis of the number and distribution of actions performed by the participants in the community, the kinds of activities in which they are engaged, and the themes addressed in their messages. From these data, we conclude that ComPratica is effectively functioning as a community of practice and is leading to changes related to both teachers' and researchers' professional development, which seem capable of reducing the research-practice gap in science education. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community of practice; Online networks; Research-practice gap; Teachers' professional development",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia, FAPESB","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank CNPq, FAPESB, IAT and SEC-BA, for financial support.

The aim of this paper is to show how SDG can be used to improve the way resources are used in schools, allowing students to work simultaneously on individual problems at a shared display, and achieve personalized learning with individual feedback within different cultural contexts. We used computational fluency to apply our concept of 'One Mouse per Child'. It consists of a participatory approach that makes use of personal feedback on an interpersonal computer for the whole classroom. This allows for N simultaneous intelligent tutoring systems, where each child advances at his or her own pace, both within a lecture and throughout the curricular units. Each student must solve a series of mathematical exercises, generated according to his or her performance through a set of pedagogical rules incorporated into the system. In this process, the teacher has an active mediating role, intervening when students require attention. Two exploratory studies were performed. The first study was a multicultural experience between two such distanced socio-economic realities as Chile and India. It showed us that even in different environmental conditions, it is possible to implement this technology with minimal equipment (i.e. a computer, a projector, and one mouse per child). The second study was carried out in a third grade class in a low-income school in Santiago de Chile. The students were asked to solve mainly addition exercises. We established statistically relevant results and observed that the software proved most beneficial for the students with the lowest initial results. This happens because the system adapts to the students' needs, reinforcing the content they most need to work on, thus generating a personalized learning process. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arithmetic teaching; Interpersonal computer; Multiple mouse; One Mouse per Child; Shared display",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862850056

The main contribution of this study resides in the interdisciplinary development of the intervention, made in close collaboration between educational researchers, and researchers in cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology. The intervention was implemented by teachers through class activities, to promote executive functions and academic achievement. These activities were articulated into the current kindergarten curriculum and, at the same time, built upon concepts and methodologies of developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience for executive functions training. Results showed: (1) non-significant differences between groups in cognitive performance from pre- to post-training assessment, and (2) significant differences in academic achievement for Language, Mathematics, Autonomy, and Contact with peers in first grade.

Particularly, this article reviews the effects of a real-time strategy game that requires players to control the behavior of a virus and interact with cell structures in a way that resembles the actual behavior of biological agents. The evaluation of the video game presented here aims at showing that video games have representational advantages that facilitate the construction of dynamic mental models. Ultimately, the article shows that when video game's characteristics come in contact with expert knowledge during game design, the game becomes an excellent medium for supporting the learning of disciplinary content related to dynamic processes. In particular, results show that students who participated in a game-based intervention aimed at teaching biology described a higher number of temporal-dependent interactions as measured by the coding of verbal protocols and drawings than students who used texts and diagrams to learn the same topic. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biology; Dynamic mental models; Dynamic visual representations; Learning; Video games",,"Hermes-14780; National Science Foundation, NSF: 0746348","Acknowledgments This research was supported partially by grants from DIB-UNAL to Javier Corredor (Grant: Hermes-14780).",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899478341

Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games’ interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children's comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Child-game interaction; Digital games; Programming; Young children",,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work is supported by the Brazilian National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) .

Although reforms toward constructivist and inquiry-based teaching in science instruction have been made in each of the three reviewed countries, each country demonstrates limitations in the implementation of teacher education that aims at those objectives. None of these countries have rigorous selection criteria for candidates for science teacher education programs, although each has some type of certification or test requirement before entry into the public education system is permitted. The three countries have similar teacher training programs, with instruction programs lasting between 4 and 5 years; programs entail both disciplinary instruction and pedagogical instruction that starts in the first year. Data from the three countries show that a high percentage of instruction in the training programs is devoted to general pedagogy with less instruction time devoted to specific preparation for teaching science. Disciplinary instruction accounts for nearly 50 % of the instruction program among secondary teachers. Training in other subjects such as nature of science, history of science and scientific inquiry is poorly developed. In general, there are few opportunities for research on practicum, as these opportunities tend to occur at the end of the training program. The generation of instruction standards by governments as well as the increase in the number of scholars dedicated to the investigation of science education and the education of science teachers suggests that some of these shortcomings could be remedied in the future. © 2015, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.","Pedagogical content knowledge; Practicum; Science methods courses; Science teacher education; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019830440

In this article, we describe the activities developed for these two courses and the assessment tools used to measure the learning that took place with respect to biology and statistics. We distinguished the effectiveness of these learning opportunities in helping students improve their understanding of the math and statistical concepts addressed and, more importantly, their ability to apply them to solve a biological problem.

Although these parks have operated for many years, there is no universally accepted definition in the literature or consensus regarding the contributions of STPs to the region and tenant companies. Using the method proposed by Lage Junior and Godinho Filho (2010), this study analyses 56 articles, indicating their objectives and results and providing guidance on controversial topics, and identifies existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges for future studies.

This paper reports the development, implementation, and evaluation of one of the epiSTEMe science modules. Entitled Forces and Proportional Relations, the module covers standard curricular material in the domain of forces, while paying particular attention to the proportional nature of many key constructs. It was developed in collaboration with a small group of teachers; implemented subsequently in 16 classrooms, in all cases involving students from the first year of secondary school; and evaluated through comparison with first-year students in 13 control classrooms who were studying the topic using established methods. Evaluation addressed topic mastery and opinions about the topic and the manner in which it was taught. While further research is required before definite conclusions are warranted, results relating to topic mastery provide grounds for optimism about the epiSTEMe approach.

To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is used where portable educational video games were introduced into first and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in mathematics and language.

However, most of the research has been done with children beyond the ages of early childhood. This could be due to the common and erroneous belief that young children have not developed the capacity to work collaboratively toward a given aim. In this paper we show how small group co-located collaborative learning on a single display computer improves oral language, logical-mathematical and social skills in pre-school children. Considering that early childhood teachers have a responsibility to provide a supportive environment, teacher mediation is essential in order to achieve collaborative learning. Thus, teachers were trained in the use of the technology and strategies for effective collaborative learning. The study was implemented in 10 kindergarten classrooms with 268 children between the ages of 5 and 6 years old. A group of 5 kindergarten classrooms with equivalent characteristics participated as a comparison group. During the four-month intervention, children worked on collaborative activities at least twice a week. A quasi-experimental approach was used to assess the implementation, including pre- and post-testing.

This traditional model may turn elementary-level lessons into an extremely theoretical, boring and non-effective process. In this context, research in mathematics elementary education in Mexico indicates the need to analyze alternative pedagogic practices and to find different ways to make mathematics education in early ages less difficult and more attractive. Constructivist theory can provide an alternative for developing pedagogic proposals. The objectives of this research were: (1) develop a computational platform to support the traditional Mexican method of education with practical mathematics problems simulated as part of the daily world environment and to increase the level of students' social involvement through direct collaboration, and (2) analyze how this computational tool affects student motivation, collaboration and discussion. An exploratory case study concerning dimensions of mathematics problem-solving using computer simulations was conducted with 6-8 year old elementary school children. After a theoretical class the children were involved in solving a series of verbal problems, using our computational platform. Sixty third-grade children participated in this case study and data were collected from their responses to questions and interviews in order to explore attitudes toward learning mathematics and assess self-efficacy in this area. The results obtained in this research indicate that the integration of computational tools into conventional method courses provides elements to improve student motivation, collaboration and discussion based on their own exploratory experiences. These results can assist other education programs to incorporate positive attitudes and their own knowledge creation from a constructivist approach using technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Research in Mathematics Education looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of ""changing the sign"" when ""moving"" the member. To minimize this problem, a balance can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2) determine how substituting the conventional balance with a computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity, negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First, because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue, cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for solving 1st degree equations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This situation has been detected in previous research for the case of field lines: many college students assign material properties to the lines and describe them, for example, as tubes that contain or transport charges. The historical evolution of this concept shows that early scientists like Faraday assigned material properties to these lines in some occasions. In the present work a history-based instructional material was designed to foster the analysis of the ontology of field lines to help students at an Argentinean university achieve conceptual change. The predicates used by the students to describe physical situations were used as evidence of the assigned ontological status. Conceptual change was measured by the change in the proportion of geometrical predicates that students used when referring to the lines in a written questionnaire. This change was significantly higher for the students learning with the history-based material compared to those that learned in the regular class. Some characteristics of the material and geometrical ideas that students hold about the field lines were determined through an oral interview. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Distance education; Education; Learning systems; Students; Conceptual change; Material properties; To-be-learned concept; Natural sciences computing",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846598896

In this context, the first objective of this study was to identify the impact of professional development programme (PDP) on teachers’ understanding of nature of science (NOS) and evolution and on the acceptance of this theory. Its second objective was to study the relationship among these variables. Three instruments were used to quantify these variables: the Views of the Nature of Science Version D (VNOS D+), the Assessing Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORN), and the Measure of Acceptance of Theory of Evolution (MATE). The results indicate that the PDP had a positive impact on teachers, significantly improving their understanding of the NOS and natural selection, as well as their acceptance of the TE. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the understanding of the NOS obtained by teachers in the first part of the PDP and the understanding and acceptance of evolution that these teachers showed at the end of the programme was determined.

A main policy challenge at present is related to the unequal distribution of vital resources, including technology. In the educational context, many changes have been observed, such as a decrease in analphabetism and an increase in the number of physicians, lawyers, and scientists. In this paper we will describe the educational experience involving the use of information technology, especially computers, at Brazilian primary and secondary schools. We live in a technological era in which it is important to educate our children to be aware of the impact of technology on society and the environment in general, as well as how to personally deal with them. From home to workplace, digital technological tools have become a part of day-to-day life. Digital technology has become essential in everyday life, and demands have been placed on schools to educate students so as to make them ""technologically literate"". Millions of Reals (R$) have been invested by the Brazilian government to equip schools with computers and communication tools, but low technological literacy remains a serious challenge.

In the present study, we investigated the impact of the implementation and use of computers in the public school system, from the elementary grades to high school, in Niterói city, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). This city, with a total population of approximately 500,000, was chosen for this study based on the claim it offers the best educational project in Brazil, and on the fact that it is ranked as the first city in terms of digital inclusion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the second one in all Brazil, according to IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography (Census 2000). This is a rather significant standings and represents an important qualitative and quantitative feature in comparison to other Brazilian municipalities and even to the experience in other countries. In our survey, we found that 82% of the municipal elementary schools (from the 1st to 4th grades, equivalent to the elementary school system in the US, and to the first phase of secondary education in France, and 32% of the state schools, including secondary school (high school system in the US, and the 2nd phase of secondary education in France) have computer laboratories. Difficulties were observed, such as the adequacy of teachers' training and continuing education, computer laboratory schedule, number of computers available, and equipment maintenance.

In the past few years, strategies have been generated to optimize the use of technological resources with the aim of facilitating widespread adoption of technology in the classroom. Given its low acquisition and maintenance costs, the interpersonal computer allows individual interaction and simultaneous learning with large groups of students. The purpose of this work was to compare arithmetical knowledge acquired by third-grade students through the use of game-based activities and non-game-based activities using an interpersonal computer, with knowledge acquired through the use of traditional paper-and-pencil activities, and to analyze their impact in various socio-cultural contexts. To do this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 271 students in three different countries (Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica), in both rural and urban schools. A set of educational games for practising arithmetic was developed and tested in six schools within these three countries. Results show that there were no significant differences (ANCOVA) in the learning acquired from game-based vs. non-game-based activities. However, both showed a significant difference when compared with the traditional method. Additionally, both groups using the interpersonal computer showed higher levels of student interest than the traditional method group, and these technological methods were seen to be especially effective in increasing learning among weaker students. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).","Arithmetic practice; Cross-cultural projects; Educational games; Intelligent tutoring systems; Interpersonal computer; Shared display",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907301471

However, workable solutions that lead to improvements in research and practice are yet to emerge. As newly qualified educational neuroscientists, our experiences dictate that the progress in this field relies upon 'Educational Neuroscience' being recognised as a distinct discipline. We therefore present a four-stage practical approach that concretely describes the role of the educational neuroscientist and details how neuroscientific knowledge can be practically assessed in the classroom. Using this approach, junior scientists will become empowered to replace the 'bridge' between education and neuroscience with a stronger, distinct Educational Neuroscience highway that is built in parallel to the existing paths. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","Education; Neuroscience; Professional practice","academic achievement; article; cognition; education; learning; mathematics; medical research; neuroscience; priority journal; teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899878373

An Interactive Platform for Learning Calculus (PIAC) that serves as a container for the LU was created following a specific instructional design, namely, the Teaching Unit Model (TUM), which in turn, rules the platform's design, development and implementation. A general perspective on the development of the platform and its LU is presented, including the results of usability and functionality evaluations, which indicate that the platform and the LU comply with different functionality and usability criteria which are fundamental for their introduction into formal university courses. The platform was utilized in a higher education Calculus course.; its effects on different aspects of the learning process were studied. Two experimental groups and two control groups for a total of 102 students taking the Calculus course participated in the study. Results indicated an overall acceptance of using PIAC in class. Important evidence was obtained on the positive effects of using PIAC, not only influencing academic performance of students, but also in motivational aspects of the learning process. The grades obtained in all of academic activities by the groups using PIAC, compared with the control groups, provide solid evidence to the positive influence of the intervention of the technology under the TUM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, it presents the distraction and focus of attention problems that arise while using computer technology with off-the-shelf software for supporting different activities which take place in usual lectures. Examples of these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion, individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion of ""CiC"". The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage of both this system and standard software are compared and research results are presented. Results show the CiC is useful to solve the problem.","Architectures for educational technology system; Collaborative learning; Face-to-face learning; Improving classroom teaching; Teaching/learning strategies",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54149090245

Using primary survey data from 628 randomly-selected households, we find that farm size, local wage rates, out-migration, access to credit services, and associations with agricultural cooperatives positively influence the WTP for mini-tillers while the number of draft animals owned negatively influence the WTP for mini-tillers. On average, farmers were willing to pay 31% less than the actual price of a mini-tiller. Results also exhibited a heterogeneous demand in which the lowest quartile farm size households, typically the poorest farm households, were willing to pay 26% less for the mini-tiller than the top quartile of farms.

These have a great impact on the teaching process, as it is currently considered that education should be interactive with respect to the environment. In recent years, the educational system has been able to perceive that, in scientific areas such as geometry, students have been limited to the role of receivers of conceptual contents from texts and websites, leaving aside the interaction by the learner with the surrounding environment. Studies using surveys conducted based on a Likert scale and administered with questions in simple language that is easily understood by the respondents have shown us that if the utility of environmental resources can be successfully merged with scientific areas, the result is greater knowledge acquisition and interest among students, especially in the area of geometry.

It was created to work as a complementary tool for teacher education that aimed at promoting reflection on inclusion and resignification of teachers' practice. We present some aspects of inclusive education in Brazil and our perspective on teacher education for inclusion. Then we explore the learning object, the pedagogical framework that guided its conception, and the survey that we conducted designed to evaluate the object in its technical and pedagogical aspects. A total of 163 participants answered a questionnaire comprised of 20 closed questions and 3 open-ended questions. Simple descriptive statistics allowed us to determine that participants rated the object very positively. Thematic content analysis was used to organize the qualitative data of the two open-ended questions in three analytical categories. Simple quantification and description was used to analyze the third open-ended question. We concluded that the LO is a valuable complementary resource that contributes to teacher education for inclusion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In SDG students work in groups that share one area on a large display screen in front of the class. Each individual student in a group has a mouse and together the students in each group need to perform assignments by using ""silent collaboration"". In the current study, the assignment for the students was to identify and create different kinds of triangles. Outcomes of interest were learning gains (quantitative) and effectiveness of ""silent collaboration"" (qualitative). Learning gains were significantly higher for students in the SDG condition than for students following traditional instruction.

Results obtained show: Criterion 1, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that Planck's role in the origin of the quantum hypothesis was more at the level of an empirical adjustment, whereas Einstein provided the physical significance of the quantum hypothesis; Criterion 2, few textbooks (two satisfactory and four mentioned) included alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Bohm) and thus ignored that most theories are underdetermined by experimental evidence; Criterion 3, none of the textbooks described satisfactorily that orbitals are mathematical constructs and the shapes of the orbitals (s, p, d, f) are not derived from quantum mechanics but instead from electron density measurements; Criterion 4, although, quantum mechanics approaches classical mechanics as a limiting case, none of the textbooks presented a framework to facilitate transition in student understanding from classical to quantum mechanics (28 textbooks made a simple mention); and Criterion 5, few textbooks (one satisfactory, five mentioned) facilitated the introduction of quantum numbers based on experimental determination of electron density (photoelectron spectrum).

Nevertheless, few studies have used these tools to acquire and analyse interaction data to better understand the students’ performance and behaviours, often due to data availability or inadequate granularity. To address this problem, we propose an Online Judge called CodeBench, which allows for fine-grained data collection of student interactions, at the level of, eg, keystrokes, number of submissions, and grades. We deployed CodeBench for 3 years (2016–18) and collected data from 2058 students from 16 introductory computer science (CS1) courses, on which we have carried out fine-grained learning analytics, towards early detection of effective/ineffective behaviours regarding learning CS concepts. Results extract clear behavioural classes of CS1 students, significantly differentiated both semantically and statistically, enabling us to better explain how student behaviours during programming have influenced learning outcomes. Finally, we also identify behaviours that can guide novice students to improve their learning performance, which can be used for interventions. We believe this work is a step forward towards enhancing Online Judges and helping teachers and students improve their CS1 teaching/learning practices. © 2020 British Educational Research Association",,"Computer programming; Grading; Students; Teaching; Automatic grading; Data availability; Introductory computer science; Introductory programming; Learning performance; Programming assignments; Student behaviours; Student interactions; Behavioral research","8.387/1991; Universidade Federal de Alagoas, UFAL","This research, carried out within the scope of the Samsung‐UFAM Project for Education and Research (SUPER), according to Article 48 of Decree nº 6.008/2006 (SUFRAMA), was funded by Samsung Electronics of Amazonia Ltda, under the terms of Federal Law nº 8.387/1991, through agreement 001/2020, signed with Federal University of Amazonas and FAEPI, Brazil.","This research, carried out within the scope of the Samsung-UFAM Project for Education and Research (SUPER), according to Article 48 of Decree n? 6.008/2006 (SUFRAMA), was funded by Samsung Electronics of Amazonia Ltda, under the terms of Federal Law n? 8.387/1991, through agreement 001/2020, signed with Federal University of Amazonas and FAEPI, Brazil.",,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085053731

About 980 active academic staff from 43 Spanish public universities participated. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as a theoretical framework for the operational definition of the variables. Through the use of data mining techniques (clustering and decision trees), groupings were made based on the b-learning adoption stage and a subsequent predictive model of these stages. The results show that the intention to use BL is the most important predictor variable in all models applied. In addition, the relationship between higher frequency of use and experience in digital educational environments with higher stages of implementation of the BL methodology was verified. Regarding the socio-demographic variables included in the study, it was observed that they exert effects that are marginal in all cases. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many universities and higher education institutions are designing strategic plans and diverse actions to implement and spread the use of BL methodologies. TAM has been widely used to study the behaviour and the intention of using a wide variety of specific technologies in the classroom. The study of BL from the perspective of TAM has generally been carried out using inferential analysis techniques. What this paper adds Analysis of complex systems such as the BL methodology from the TAM approach. Groups of adopting teachers can be analysed using the TAM approach according to the stage of use of this innovation. In contrast to traditional inferential techniques, this paper proposes a methodological procedure based on decision trees, which facilitates a more refined analysis of the relationship and interactions between the set of TAM predictor variables (PU, PEOU, BI, etc.) and the criterion variable (stages of adoption). The obtaining of more complete and adjusted trees leads to better prediction and identification of the concrete actions that could be implemented by higher education institutions as protective or motivating factors for the diffusion of the BL methodology. Implications for practice and/or policy Interest in focusing attention on a complex system such as the one represented by the BL methodology from the perspective of models of technological acceptance reinforces an interesting line of research that can enrich the approach and scope of the TAM theory and generates knowledge that helps promote strategic actions to optimise the institutional diffusion of the BL training modality in higher education contexts. © 2019 British Educational Research Association",,"Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Contextual variables; Digital educational environments; Operational definition; Predictive modeling; Professional characteristics; Socio-demographic variables; Technology acceptance model; Theoretical framework; Data mining","EDU2015-6721-R; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work was supported by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

The findings obtained by applying a survey and performing classroom observations show that, although the schools are willing to use this resource, it has been used sporadically for searching information and drilling and practicing contents related to Mathematics and Language, in addition to motivating students. Furthermore, the classroom observations do not reveal any innovative teaching strategies, related to the use of this new technology.

However, current understanding of biodiversity includes other components, such as the number, abundance, composition, and spatial distribution of species and functional groups. This paper aimed to identify high school students’ frameworks of biodiversity, to assess their conceptual understanding of biodiversity against scientific definitions, and to analyze the influence of sex and school location on students’ understanding of biodiversity. By administering a written questionnaire in which ten different biodiversity scenarios were presented, each consisting of two environments which differed in certain biodiversity components, we asked students (n = 321, 15–18 years old) to choose and argue their preference for biodiversity conservation. Students held a range of frameworks of biodiversity, with some of them being in agreement with scientific conceptualizations (idea of variance as the number of species, functional groups, and trophic relationships). However, students were strongly centered on species richness and undervalued population size, functional characters, species evenness, and alpha diversity. Biodiversity was associated with a notion of balance, by which a proportioned trophic chain prevents species extinction. Overall, students used few components of biodiversity in their argumentations, with no influence of school location or sex. We recommend that teachers fully integrate students’ frameworks with more updated definitions of biodiversity than that of the CBD, conceptualizing its components in order to empower students to decide on current socioscientific issues. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Balance of nature; Biological diversity; Conceptual framework; Food web; Socioscientific issue",,"Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, UNC; Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, FCA","We wish to thank all the students and teachers for their collaboration, Prof. Dr. S.

Moreover, whilst great relevance has been given to aspects such as innovation factors, product results, cognitive knowledge, poor attention has been given to other fundamental factors: product development process and effectiveness of design process as a consequence of complex problem situation. A formalization in affordances of design process may help overcome said issues and enhance product effectiveness, by identifying and highlighting potential designers’ workload perception during the Product Development Process. In this scenario, this paper describes an approach for continuously monitoring and measuring the complexity of design process during the creation of a new product. After an overview of the related work, this study proposes a common instructional design model for Product Development Process, which was split in order to be measured by using NASA-TLX. This research propose that the use of NASA-TLX to predict and measure the designer workload during the design process contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among the different design phases and designer workload.

However, various studies have shown that a large number of elementary and secondary science teachers do not possess an adequate understanding of NOS. This study investigated how elementary teachers’ understanding of NOS was impacted through a 1-year professional development program in Chile that included NOS instruction as a theme throughout two types of mini-courses in the program. Twelve teachers attended a 1-year development program focused on improving teacher content knowledge and included the instruction of NOS embedded in two self-contained NOS mini-courses (36 h) and two lessons (3 h each) within five science content mini-courses (30 h). The Views of NOS (version D+) questionnaire and interviews were used to assess teachers’ understanding of NOS at the beginning (January) and end of the program (December). Elementary teachers’ understanding of the creative, inferential, and tentative aspect of NOS showed improvement. According to the teachers’ perceptions, the most significant activities for improving their NOS understanding were decontextualized activities in both types of mini-courses (self-contained NOS and science content mini-courses).

For students, it is very important to grasp the basic concepts that make computers and digital systems possible. Among these concepts, boolean algebra and logic gates stand out. In this paper, a smartphone-based augmented reality (AR) system is proposed which helps in the adequate learning of logic gate integrated circuits (ICs). The proposed system allows the automatic identification of ICs that enables basic logic operations. It uses a smartphone and a breadboard for the identification of 7 basic logic gate ICs that are: AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, and XNOR gate. The smartphone takes a picture of the electronic circuit and digitally generates a layer of virtual objects which are then mixed with the original image. The markless paradigm identifies the ICs in a typical circuit and places three objects that are: IC identification, pins information, and logic diagram information.

Different instructional strategies such as decontextualized, hands-on inquiry, and history of science (HOS) activities have been proposed for teaching NOS. This article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology teachers’ understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training. Teachers’ views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews, and in the second session we collected information about teachers’ perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers’ understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated NOS. The relationship between teachers’ improved understanding of NOS and their instructional NOS skills is also discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT: 1131029","This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), under Grant 1131029 to the first author.

However, CMS focuses on the administration and development of websites, while LMS is mainly focused on the management of training through the use of learning objects. CMS and LMS have features that can be used in conjunction in order to create educational environments which enhance the teaching-learning process in classrooms. This article presents a hybrid management system called Athena for multi-device educational content providing a set of Web-based interfaces for managing, presenting, and generating PHP-based applications with educational content, reducing both the time and effort invested during the development process of this type of software. Athena borrows the main features of both CMS and LMS in order to manage and reuse educational content. Athena allows the user to develop platform-independent multi-device educational software using existing educational content. Athena aims to provide new forms of accessibility to educational content, envisioning a better future for online education. To demonstrate Athena's capabilities, we have presented a case study for generating a multi-device physics course to emphasize our contribution. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CMS; educational environments; educational software; hybrid management system; LMS","Application programs; Curium; Distance education; Websites; Content management system; Educational environment; Educational software; Learning management system; Management systems; Platform independent; Software applications; Teaching-learning process; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911369043

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices. © 2011 The Authors.

Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are already today being applied in a number of research fields related to climate change and environmental monitoring. Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Anthropocene; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Climate change; Digitalization; Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Systemic risks","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Extraction; Forestry; Marine applications; Marine biology; Oceanography; Predictive analytics; Sustainable development; Timber; Automated decision making; Cascading failures; Critical questions; Ecological changes; Environmental Monitoring; Governance mechanisms; Marine resources; Sensor technologies; Artificial intelligence; agricultural application; Anthropocene; artificial intelligence; automation; climate change; decision making; digitization; environmental monitoring; forestry; governance approach; marine resource; risk assessment; sustainability","National Science Foundation, NSF: 1444755, 1927167, 1934933; Microsoft; Princeton University; Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, PIIRS; Pennsylvania State University, PSU; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, KVA; Vienna Science and Technology Fund, WWTF: VRG16-005; BMS College of Engineering; Stockholms Universitet, SU","We would like to thank the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) , and the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (Princeton University) for funding and hosting the workshop ""Human-Machine-Ecology: A Workshop on the Emerging Risks, Opportunities, and Governance of Artificial Intelligence"" at Princeton University on January 11th-12th, 2019, and the Consulate General of Sweden in New York for hosting the second workshop “Artificial Intelligence, People, and the Planet"" in New York, on October 15th, 2019.

MOOCs have been used as part of face-to-face regular university courses as a new form of blended learning (BL), but little is known about the best ways to design effective MOOC-based BL. Besides, studies that assess the intention to continue using MOOCs do not assess their quality and value as perceived by students. This study aims to understand how MOOCs can be better integrated into blended learning. To do so, an exploratory case study was carried out a in MOOC-based BL in the discipline Fundamentals of Administration at a Brazilian university to evaluate three aspects: (1) pedagogical approach/rationale; (2) pedagogical/instructional design for integrating the MOOC into the course; and (3) perceived quality and value by the students. The results show that the MOOC was used as a blended learning method in an introductory course, replacing part of the hours of face-to-face classes, allowing an increase of the number of students per teacher, besides making the discipline more attractive to the students. Results also show that the functional value perceived by the students is favorable, with a score of 4.53 (7-point scale) and is influenced by the perceived quality regarding the MOOC (r = 0.29) and blended learning process (r = 0.22). This study extends previous research by demonstrating two different designs of MOOC-based BL that contribute to the improvement of the pedagogical process, reduce costs, and improve the quality problems of MOOCs. In addition, this study developed a model that associates perceived quality and perceived value with the intention to continue MOOCs within the context of the MOOC-based BL. This model may be used to evaluate which strategies for MOOC-based BL generate the highest perceived quality by the students. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blended learning; Country-specific developments; Improving classroom teaching; MOOCs; Postsecondary education","Curricula; Education computing; Learning systems; Quality control; Students; Exploratory case studies; Introductory course; Massive open online course; Pedagogical approach; Pedagogical process; Perceived quality; Traditional models; University course; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096500726

Despite the importance, theoretically given to the TICs, a great gap is found in the scientific literature regarding the measurements of these capabilities in the higher education sector. In this paper, the results of the implementation of a fuzzy inference diagnostic system for organizational capabilities for innovation in a university institution (UI) in the city of Medellin, Colombia are presented. The system consists of the application of a structured diagnostic instrument - type interviewed-to the management and teaching staff of the institution. The data is adapted to the requirements of a fuzzy inference system, in which previously defined variables are related, their values are standardized and entered in an inference system. The values were implemented and processed in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox - MATLAB. As inference system output, concrete numerical values, and surfaces of fuzzy inference were obtained to formulate organizational strategies aimed at improving the technological innovation capabilities of the institution. © 2017","Fuzzy logics; Higher education institutions; Organizational capabilities; Technological innovation","Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Human resource management; Research and development management; Temperature indicating cameras; Fuzzy inference systems; Higher education institutions; Higher education institutions (HEIs); Organizational capabilities; Organizational strategy; Research and development; Technological innovation; Technological innovation capability; Fuzzy inference; fuzzy mathematics; higher education; innovation; management; teaching; university sector; Antioquia [Colombia]; Colombia; Medellin",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020738889

Fortysix athletes were assessed, whereby 21 were from Male Artistic Gymnastics and 25 from Female Artistic Gymnastics. To determine the somatotype, the Heath & Carter's anthropometric method was used (1990). The body composition was assessed by electrical bioimpedance on the InBody R20 scale, and variables of skeletal muscle mass (MM), fat mass (MG), fat-free mass (MLG) and fat percentage (%G) were measured. Descriptive statistics was used. Results show that the dominant somatotype within the group of male gymnasts was the Balanced mesomorph while among the females, the prevalent classification was Ectomorphic mesomorph. The body composition of the male gymnasts presented the average values of 33.08 ± 3.53 kg for lean muscle mass, 7.44 ± 1.57 kg for fat mass, 57.74 ± 5.78 kg for fat-free mass and a fat percentage of 11.39 ± 2.08, while the female gymnasts showed values of 21.7 ± 3.38 kg for lean body mass, 7.55 ± 2.73 kg for fat mass, 38.12 ± 5.77 kg for fat-free mass and a fat percentage of 15.84 ± 3.79.

Our goal is to broaden the understanding of online teacher education programmes at undergraduate level in contexts where most trainees are practicing teachers and where online education is the only possibility for holding a teaching qualification. We focused on the motivating factors that led 71 trainees to enrol and to remain in this online teacher training course. Through a mixed methods approach, the trainees completed an online survey (n = 71) and participated in a follow-up interview (n = 24).

STEM as a renovated approach is gaining ground, despite the infancy of its philosophical analysis. Explicit epistemological discussion of integrated STEM proposals is either absent or blurred. The overall aim of this paper is therefore to establish an initial framework for philosophical discussion, to help analyse the aims and discourse of integrated STEM education, and consider the implications that adopting any particular epistemological view might have on the aims for general education, and on the construction of science curricula oriented towards citizenship and social justice. We envisage humanist values for integrated STEM education and, after revisiting the currently proposed relationships between the STEM knowledge areas, we adopt a model of a “seamless web” for such relationships that is coherent with humanist values. A few issues emerging from this model are addressed through the lens of the so-called “family resemblance approach”, a framework from the field of research on the nature of science, in order to identify some potential central features of “nature of STEM”. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Family resemblance approach; Humanist science education; Integrated STEM education; Nature of STEM; Philosophy of science; Seamless web",,"EDU2017-89405-R; European Commission, EC: 2017-1-ES01-KA201-038204; Junta de Castilla y León: BU096G18","This study was partially funded by the European Union through project 2017-1-ES01-KA201-038204, by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness of Spain through project EDU2017-89405-R and by the Junta de Castilla y León through project BU096G18.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085963116

Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","21CC abilities; Arduino; climate change; hands-on; information and communication technology; project-based learning",,"ED190018; 116280; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: 21150634; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT","We thank EXPLORA-CONICYT for funding ‘Ecoinformática para Jóvenes’, Project ED190018.

The results of the linear regression (machine learning with 50% and 70% of training) indicate that the WAEPS facilitates the educational process on statistics. In fact, the WAEPS promotes the active role in the student, develops mathematical skills and facilitates the assimilation of knowledge about the calculation of upper and lower limits in the Normal Distribution by means of data simulation, interactivity and navigation. Even students consider that this web application is innovative and useful for the educational field. In addition, data science (decision tree tech-nique) identifies various predictive models on the impact of the WAEPS in the educational process. Finally, the TPACK model is an ideal frame of reference to innovate the teaching–learning process through technological, pedagogical and content knowledge. © 2019 R.-A.

Further revisions of instructors reveal to the students their mistakes, such as a lack of argumentation. However, the depth of revisions is often limited by the time availability of the instructor. In this paper, we present a system for argument assessment embedded in an Internet-based Moodle course with Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard, to help students improve argumentation in the problem statement, justification and conclusion sections of their final project report. The system identifies argumentative paragraphs along with argumentation level and provides recommendations to improve their writing. The analysis is achieved employing machine learning techniques with lexical features trained using an annotated collection of student writings. We performed a pilot test to compare control and experimental groups. Both groups consisted of undergraduate students of computer engineering programs from two different universities. We observed that using the argument assessment system increased the number of arguments in the experimental group. We discuss some further improvements for the system. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","academic writing; argumentation studies; computer-assisted argument analysis; engineering education Moodle","Computer aided analysis; Computer aided instruction; Human computer interaction; Interoperability; Learning systems; Academic writings; Argument assessment; argumentation studies; Computer assisted; Computer engineering; Computer engineering program; Machine learning techniques; Undergraduate students; Students","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 357381; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONCYT","The first author was supported by CONACYT, México, through scholarship 357381.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053821784

It uses a large, university-wide data set to demonstrate the methodology for this analysis by using the case study method. It presents empirical findings about relationships between student behaviours in a learning management system (LMS) and the learning outcomes of students, and further explores these findings using process modelling techniques. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes a two-year study in a Chilean university, using big data from a LMS and from the central university database of student results and demographics. Descriptive statistics of LMS use in different years presents an overall picture of student use of the system. Process mining is described as an event-centred approach to give a deeper level of understanding of these findings. Findings: The study found evidence to support the idea that instructors do not strongly influence student use of an LMS. It replicates existing studies to show that higher-performing students use an LMS differently from the lower-performing students. It shows the value of combining variable- and event-centred approaches to learning analytics. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its institutional context, its two-year time frame and by its exploratory mode of investigation to create a case study. Practical implications: The paper is useful for institutions in developing a methodology for using big data from a LMS to make use of event-centred approaches. Originality/value: The paper is valuable in replicating and extending recent studies using event-centred approaches to analysis of learning data. The study here is on a larger scale than the existing studies (using a university-wide data set), in a novel context (Latin America), that provides a clear description for how and why the methodology should inform institutional approaches. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data; e-Learning; Educational administrative data processing; Latin America; Learning analytics; Universities",,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica, FONDECYT: 1131109","The work in this paper was supported by FONDECYT Grant No. 1131109.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008386241

Courses in these new formats are often for credit and have clear market value through the acquisition of competencies and skills. However, the endemic issue of academic dishonesty remains lingering and generating untrustworthiness regarding what students did to complete these courses. In this case study, we focus on SPOCs with academic recognition developed at the University of Cauca in Colombia and hosted in their Open edX instance called Selene Unicauca. We have developed a learning analytics algorithm to detect dishonest students based on submission time and exam responses providing as output a number of indicators that can be easily used to identify students. Our results in two SPOCs suggest that 17% of the students that interacted enough with the courses have performed academic dishonest actions, and that 100% of the students that were dishonest passed the courses, compared to 62% for the rest of students. Contrary to what other studies have found, in this study, dishonest students were similarly or even more active with the courseware than the rest, and we hypothesize that these might be working groups taking the course seriously and solving exams together to achieve a higher grade. With MOOC-based degrees and SPOCs for credit becoming the norm in distance learning, we believe that if this issue is not tackled properly, it might endanger the future of the reliability and value of online learning credentials. © 2020, The Author(s).","Academic dishonesty; Cheating; Learning analytics; Massively open online course; MOOC; Small private online courses; SPOC",,"European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: FJCI-2017-34926","Authors want to acknowledge support from PROF-XXI project (609767-EPP-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), the European Commission and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Juan de la Cierva Formaci?n program (FJCI-2017-34926).

We explore multiple ways of looking at students’ performance through their written assessments and discuss features of student responses that are made visible through these analyses.

This problem is solved by classifying students into two classes using educational activities related statistical datasets. One of the classes must identify the students who have the tendency to persist. The other class must identify the students who have the tendency to dropout. This problem often encounters a phenomenon that masks out the obtained results. This study delves into this phenomenon and provides a reliable educational data mining technique that accurately predicts the dropout rates. In particular, the three data classifying techniques, namely, decision tree, neural networks and Balanced Bagging, are used. The performances of these classifies are tested with and without the use of a downsample, SMOTE and ADASYN data balancing. It is found that among other parameters geometric mean and UAR provides reliable results while predicting the dropout rates using Balanced Bagging classifying techniques. © 2019 by the authors.

Our main objectives were (a) to describe the knowledge of high school students from the province of Cordoba, Argentina with respect to native animal species, (b) to determine if any exotic species (introduced or domestic) are considered native, and (c) to analyze the effects of school sector and gender on the students’ knowledge of the native fauna. In total, 321 students aged 15–18 from 14 urban schools (8 state and 6 private schools) were asked to write down ten animals native to Córdoba, Argentina, in a free-list questionnaire. Relative frequencies and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to analyze the categorized (animal names) and continuous answers (quantity of responses, number of native animals, etc.), with the 25 most frequently mentioned species showing a predominance of native ones, of which “Puma” (Puma concolor) and “Andean condor” (Vultur gryphus) were the most prominent. An overrepresentation of mammalian species compared to other classes of chordates was also found, with high school students mentioning native and domestic species higher on the free-list. Using GLMM, we found that school sector had a significant effect on the number of native animals mentioned at both national and local levels, and on domestic and mixed species. Finally, male students mentioned more species and more native animals than their female counterparts. These findings were interpreted and discussed in light of sociocultural and traditional ecological knowledge theories, from which several implications arose related to research and practice. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Argentina; Biodiversity; Biological diversity; Fauna; State school; Traditional ecological knowledge",,"Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, UNC; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT: PICT-2011-0977; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, SECYT","We wish to thank all students and teachers for their collaboration.

In this multi-session experiment, third grade students working on arithmetic exercises from various curricular units were divided into three groups. The first group used personal computers (netbooks), the second group used an interpersonal computer (ie, one projector with a screen, one computer and one mouse per child) and the third group used pen-and-paper. The results of the experiment indicate that all three groups achieved an increase in learning, as shown by the pretest and posttest scores. No significant difference was found between the interpersonal computer and personal computer groups. This suggests that the key characteristic shared by the two groups is the provision of feedback. The format that such feedback takes, either private (through a personal screen) or public (through a shared screen), is shown to make no difference. However, the results significantly favour groups that are provided with instant feedback (interpersonal computer and personal computer) as opposed to delayed feedback (pen-and-paper). © 2015 British Educational Research Association.",,"E-learning; Paper; Students; Delayed feedback; Key characteristics; Second group; Student learning outcomes; Personal computers; Computers; Experimentation",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954184325

However, to obtain these potential advantages something more than forming and assigning them a common goal is needed: cooperation has to occur. This paper presents guidelines for designing group activities to foster cooperation by focusing on three elements of cooperative learning: (1) positive interdependence, (2) equal participation and (3) individual accountability in both individual and group learning scenarios. The authors also describe a software tool designed according to the model proposed in which some design guidelines have been implemented in order to support cooperative learning activities and allow the cooperative process to be monitored. The preliminary results show that the participants who have interacted with this software tool have obtained good cooperation scores and cooperative abilities have been fostered: participation, engagement and communication during learning activities. © 2014 Association for Information Technology in Teacher Education.","CL; Cooperation; Cooperative learning processes; Evaluation; Monitoring",,"P11-TIC-7486; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: TIN2011-26928; CYTED Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo, CYTED: 513RT0481","This study has been partially financed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain, as part of the VIDECO project [grant number TIN2011-26928], the Andalusian research programme [grant number P11-TIC-7486] and the Iberoamerican Network (U-CSCL) [grant number CYTED, 513RT0481].",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905524062

Evoking natural convection, a relatively simple case study was proposed involving two initially room temperature porous samples (identified as two fruits) that were placed inside a refrigeration chamber. Three different configurations were suggested for placing such warmer samples so that students were asked to order them with respect to their chilling capability, that is, to their ability to chill samples as fast as possible. Freshmen's written answers were collected before CFD was used to simulate and visualize each distinct chilling scenario. Accordingly, a finite-volume FORTRAN simulator for transport phenomena in domains fully or partially filled up with porous matrix was used to help compare each chilling performance. Among all possible combinations, answer distribution is presented and discussed in the light of freshmen's scholar background as well as based on the way natural convection concepts were introduced. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computational fluid dynamics; Food engineering education; Foodstuff chilling; Mathematical modeling; Numerical simulation","Computer simulation; Electric field effects; Engineering education; Fluid dynamics; Natural convection; Students; Basic concepts; Cfd-simulations; Field visualizations; Finite volumes; Food engineering education; Food engineerings; Food industries; Foodstuff chilling; Fortrans; Mathematical modeling; Numerical simulation; Porous matrixes; Porous samples; Process Modeling; Room temperatures; Transport phenomenon; Computational fluid dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449145542

Despite its importance, and the fact that it is taught in technical and college courses, as well as in companies' training sectors, SQC has been largely misused. An inappropriate teaching approach may be the cause of such problem; therefore it has motivated the development of a model for SQC teaching, allowing its learners to correctly apply SQC techniques. After a survey regarding the concept needed to correctly apply SQC, its use and teaching/training methods, the model's contents and methodology were defined. We also realized the opportunity of incorporating a computer environment for the model, permitting the practice of the needed SQC concepts and skills. An Artificial Intelligence approach was used to develop the computer environment, resulting in an Intelligent Tutoring System, the STCEQ.

Given the following sentence: There are six times as many students (S) as professors (P) at this university, most students write the following equation: 6S = P, referred to as the reversal error. In order to overcome the reversal error students need to operate in a hypothetico‐deductive manner, i.e., performing a hypothetical operation that makes the group of professors six times larger than it really is (S = 6P). The objective of this study is to investigate the relation between student ability to translate sentences into equations, equations into sentences, and student performance in the following variables: formal operational reasoning, proportional reasoning, and introductory freshmen‐level chemistry course. The results obtained show that as the student ability to translate sentences into equations and equations into sentences increases, their mean scores in Chemistry I, formal operational, and proportional reasoning increases. This study has found support for the hypothesis that students who lack formal operational reasoning skills (hypothetico‐deductive reasoning) may experience more problems in the translation of algebraic equations.

This methodology is attractive, as it allows institutions to reuse high-quality material developed for MOOCs, while increasing learning flexibility and the students’ autonomy. However, the adoption of this methodology is low in general, especially in Engineering courses, as its implementation faces a number of challenges for students. The most salient challenge is the lack of student self-regulatory skills, which may result in frustration and low performance. In this paper, we study how a self-regulatory learning technological scaffold, which provides students with feedback about their activity in the MOOC, affects the engagement and performance of students in an Engineering course following a MOOC-based FC approach. To this end, we design an observational study with the participation of 242 students: 133 students in the experimental group (EG) who used a technological scaffold and 109 in the control group (CG) who did not. We did not find a statistically significant difference between the academic achievements of both groups. However, the EG exhibited a statistically significant greater engagement with the course and a more accurate strategic planning than the CG. The main implications for scaffolding self-regulated learning in FC derived from these results are discussed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","flipped classroom; higher education; massive open online course; self-regulation; time management","Engineering education; Scaffolds; Technical presentations; Academic achievements; Engineering course; Experimental groups; High-quality materials; Higher education institutions; Observational study; Self-regulated learning; Statistically significant difference; Students","609767‐EPP‐1‐2019‐1‐ES EPPKA2‐CBHE‐JP; European Commission, EC: 586120‐EPP‐1‐2017‐1‐ES‐EPPKA2‐CBHE‐JP; Universidad de Cuenca: DIUC_XVIII_2019_54","This study has been partially funded with the support of the European Commission under the LALA project (Grant No. 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP) and the PROF-XXI (Grant No. 609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES EPPKA2-CBHE-JP).

Notwithstanding the abovementioned benefits, the development and evolution of new digital ecologies of learning is still an unexplored field for knowledge representation systems. As part of a larger study, this article shows the process and results of a systematic review of literature on knowledge representation systems, with the purpose of identifying the foundations and main applicable instruments of digital educational environments. Among the most representative findings of this review is that despite the existence of a large number of educational experiences that have incorporated both physical and digital knowledge representation tools, their use has been restricted almost entirely to the understanding of concepts and the assessment of learning in non-collaborative environments. These findings suggest the relevance of studying the representation of knowledge in digital collaborative contexts that facilitate the development of thinking skills for the digital age, and the need for co-creation and transformation of knowledge.

Given that dozens of countries across the world are purchasing computers for their students, we ask which elements are necessary to improve learning when introducing digital resources into the classroom. Understood the orchestration as the coordination of conventional and digital resources, we examine whether effective resource orchestration improves student learning. To do so, an 8-month study was undertaken across 17 schools in Uruguay, involving 544 fourth grade students. A treatment group worked under an orchestrated strategy, while a control group followed the national strategy, which includes the One Laptop per Child Computer (XO). Our study confirmed that the national strategy alone is capable of producing significant progress in student learning. However, we also found that the orchestration produces a statistically significant improvement in the results when compared to the control group. The main finding indicates that when teachers have an orchestrated strategy to integrate digital and non-digital resources, student learning is enhanced in relation to the curricular objectives. Finally, we discovered that learning is improved in the treatment group when there is systematic use of resources, and when the school's infrastructure facilitates the use of the technology. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Determinants of effectiveness; Resource integration; Resource orchestration; Teachers' work in the classroom; Teaching mathematics; XO computer",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928209004

A key factor of collaborative learning that may affect learner outcomes is whether the collaborative groups are assigned project topics randomly or based on a shared interest in the topic. This is a particularly important question for adults, whose performance can depend strongly on how closely the project topic relates to their professional goals. In this study involving an on-line course for 103 professionals we divided the learners into two parallel sections that differed in how they would be assigned to groups to perform collaborative tasks on different topics. In one section, learners were assigned randomly into groups and were given task topics randomly as well. In the other section, they were assigned to a group based on whether they shared a common interest in the topic given to that group. We used Social Network Analysis and Content Analysis to assess the level of collaboration in quantitative and qualitative terms (knowledge construction). Both groups showed a low level of knowledge construction and similar levels of centrality degree and learning performance. However, more learners participated in the collaborative tasks if groups had been assigned based on learners' topic preferences. Our findings suggest that forming groups of adult learners based on topic preferences in on-line environments can increase the number of learners that collaborate, but it does not necessarily improve learner performance.","Collaborative learning; Content analysis; eLearning; Learner preference; SNA",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948142779

Advocating the use of real-life problems to initiate and motivate the learning process, PBL is an inductive strategy promoting the understanding of new concepts as well as the development of professional skills, abilities, and attitudes. Thus, it is paramount that teachers and students implement PBL in conformity to its core principles. However, such implementation becomes a challenge, considering that PBL is fundamentally different from traditional instruction methods. Without the appropriate pedagogical and technological support, PBL's quality, effectiveness, and authenticity are at risk. In an attempt to overcome these challenges, this paper presents the PBL-Coach Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), built upon PBL learning theories. This paper describes in detail a scientific investigation on a practical PBL implementation, driven by the quest to achieve the following goals: (i) Scaffold teachers and students in implementing the PBL method; (ii) Investigate useful and usable technological resources in the PBL process; (iii) Maintain PBL core principles for an authentic and effective learning process. As a result, three case studies are described and one is detailed to validate our investigation, consisting of a real-world setting with clients, teachers, tutors, and students. Each case study provided a good level of evidence that PBL-Coach, used in a real-world, authentic setting, can promote an effective learning process through a number of carefully designed technological resources.

DSP courses are difficult to the students due to a high mathematical content and high level of abstraction, for this reason, the primary objective of this work is to create a pedagogical tool that allows the improvement on the teaching process in Signal Processing courses. There are two popular approaches: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) which have been used to find time-frequency maps. The student roll was designed for active participation by creating melodies from real instruments as well as synthetic generators, and by implementing the codes of STFT and CWT in MATLAB. The results demonstrate that in general terms, after carrying out these laboratory activities the students are more motivated to learn Signal Processing theory, and some of them become interested in the new research line on Music Information Retrieval (MIR), which would benefit the continuity of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technologies ABET, obtained for the Automation Engineering program at Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro (UAQ) since 2016. © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the socioeconomic status of high-school students, as indicated by their attendance at private or state schools, on their knowledge of native plants. In total, 321 students aged 15–18 were asked to write down 10 plants native to Córdoba, Argentina, in a freelist questionnaire. Students listed a mean of 6.8 species of a total of 165 different categories of plant names. The majority of the species named were exotic to Córdoba (63%) or Argentina (50.6%, of which 33.8% were adventitious), indicating an ‘adventitious-to-native’ effect by which all spontaneously reproducing plants were presumed to be native species. However, the 20 most frequently named plants were mainly native, with ‘Algarrobo’ (Prosopis spp.) and ‘Espinillo’ (Vachellia caven) being the most mentioned. Students’ socioeconomic status had a significant effect on the number of species named, with the students of state schools (where the less well-off sectors of the society attend) mentioning more species and, among these, more native ones than the students from private schools. Furthermore, we defined size, colour and scent as being conspicuous traits of plant flowers that are relevant for human perception, and found that the most frequently named adventitious species, unlike the native ones, were those exhibiting big brightly-coloured flowers which ranged from being inodorous to having medium intensity scents. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biological diversity; Botany teaching; floral traits; plant blindness; school sector",,"Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, UNC; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT: PICT-2011-13799, PICT-2015-1903; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, SECYT","We wish to thank all students and teachers for their collaboration.

We presented an evaluation of the use of Maths educational software to support the learning of first-year primary students in the city of Mazatlan, Mexico. One of our reasons was to determine whether the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) would motivate students and make learning easier, more interesting and even fun. Three surveys were conducted wherein the following people participated: teachers who teach Maths in the first-year of primary school; managers of the computing facilities used in this study; and first-year primary students. Due to time constraints, the three surveys were only applied in three schools, in two shifts in each school. Overall, our study suggests three key aspects for learning to be improved through ICTs, namely: (1) learning activities should be designed considering the use of educational software; (2) learning materials and activities should include guiding material to facilitate learning; and (3) promote learning through play. We propose a few design principles for educational software to support learning better and more effectively. © 2017 by the authors.

This paper presents analyses in relation to the identification of Action Units (AUs) related to affective states and their impact on learning with a tutoring system. To assess affect, a tool was devised to identify AUs on pictures of human faces. Action Units are combinations of individual facial muscles or groups of muscles that create facial expressions in association with affect. Pictures from a population of students were taken while using an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics in a secondary school in a suburban school in Veracruz, Mexico. The students were asked to interact with the tutoring system for 40 minutes and they were photographed with the tool at a rate of 1 picture every 5 seconds acquiring a dataset consisting of 16,800 photos. To achieve identification, the software analyzes individual pictures using Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Euclidian distance. The tool developed to classify affective states shows 88.88% accuracy in the identification of AUs when matching the recognized AU to the Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded facial expression database. The analyses also elicited the most common AUs for the population and their association with learning with the intelligent tutoring system. These preliminary results shed light on the issues of affect in relation to learning mathematics with tutoring systems and pave the way for the implementation of coping strategies based on the automatic recognition of facial expressions.","Action units; Affect; Intelligent tutoring system",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964549181

Scientific papers from the expert community were reviewed in order to define the biodiversity conceptual framework, which acts as the epistemological vigilance during the process of didactic transposition. This revealed a multiplicity of biodiversity definitions, with a strong predominance of the number of species (richness), suggesting that many textbooks were outdated. In the light of the present study, the official curriculum does not lead to the transposition of a biodiversity conceptualization which is more in line with that of the expert community. Regarding the levels of complexity, we recommend the use of the earth and environmental sciences textbooks of the last year of high school in order to study biodiversity.","Biological diversity; Didactic transposition; Epistemological vigilance; Species; Textbooks",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912046723

However, the number of actual LA implementations at scale remains limited, notwithstanding considerable effort made to formulate guidelines and frameworks to support the LA policy development. Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated.

Background The main objective of the model presented is to arouse interest in science and technology among adolescents. Therefore, it sought to develop STEM competencies (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in chil-dren and adolescents. Understanding learning in STAM areas can favor the development of professionals who can supply the demand in related sectors, especially in the scientific-technological scope. To fulfill the main objective, strategies related to students and teachers were developed. With activities aimed at students, it was hoped to promote vocations to scientific-technolog-ical careers and encourage entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the activities related to teachers aimed at training them to integrate technology into their lesson plans. Inspired by the Maker Culture, the model sought to make it possible for teachers to become the main agents in the process of integrating technology in their lesson plans, since they were in charge of building and producing their digital content and other resources to support their didactic activities. The maker movement is a technological extension of the ""Do It Yourself!"" culture, which encourages ordinary people to build, modify, repair, and manufacture their objects, with their own hands. The training actions were preceded by a diagnosis, inspired by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, as well as the lesson plans prepared and made available by the teachers. Methodology Methodologically, the framework's work plan was composed of five Work Packages (WP), which include management, resource mapping, strategies re-lated to teachers, strategies related to students, and the dissemination and ex-ploitation of results. In the 2014-2018 period, 367 teachers participated in training activities, intending to integrate technologies into lesson plans. At the end of 2018, 27 Basic Education schools, including an indigenous and a rural school, from the public-school system, in the states of Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and the Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, using the project's Vir-tual Learning Environment (VLE). In these 70 teachers, 230 classes, and 6,766 students accessed didactic content, produced by teachers, at VLE. Also, 20 laboratories were available in 26 instances, for use in practical activi-ties in disciplines in the STEM areas. Specifically, in the STEM areas, 3,360 students from 98 classes from 9 schools had integrated the Remote Labora-tories, in lesson plans in the subjects of Physics and Biology (High School), Science (Elementary School). Contribution The main results of the application of the framework are related to the train-ing of human resources, knowledge production, and educational innovation. About the training of human resources, we sought to contribute to the train-ing of teachers concerning technology in education and, with that, arouse greater interest on the part of students, as well as obtain improvements in their learning from teaching methodologies supported on the use of digital technologies. On the other hand, the production of knowledge, in the pro-gram and the socialization of research, is favored by the model based on open-source resources, both in terms of software and hardware and with open educational resources. This characteristic favor and expands the poten-tial for reapplying research and, consequently, its contribution to educational innovation. Findings The results, about students, indicated an increase in motivation due to the creation of new teaching and learning opportunities. The fact of extending the classroom and school, through remote laboratories, to support practical activities and the use of VLE, was also pointed out as a very positive factor. On the other hand, the realization of the workshops, inspired by practices of the Maker Culture, provided an approximation of these to the skills of the real world, which will certainly favor their employability. Regarding the teach-ers, it is noticed the continuity and expansion in the use of technological re-sources in the classroom; many sought and have participated in new training actions. Recommendations for Practitioners Provision of a repository of practices for sharing and reuse of lesson plans developed by teachers participating in the research. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Recommendations for Researchers Technical documents, manuals, and guides for remote laboratories. Data col-lected in the applied questionnaires. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Impact on Society The main results of the framework application are related to human re-sources formation, knowledge production, and educational innovation. Re-garding the formation of human resources, we sought to contribute to the formation of teachers concerning technology in education and, about the stu-dents the creation of teaching and learning opportunities, to extend the class-room and also the school, through the remote laboratories, to support the practical activities and the use of the VLE.

It is recurrent that teachers use instructional methods that promote memorization, and, consequently, the learning process may prove unsatisfactory. This paper introduces Virtual Algebra Tiles, an open educational resource whose purpose is to enable students to use algebra tiles from a computer to enhance their knowledge of algebra concepts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we designed a case study. The participants were 40 students of engineering degrees who were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Results indicate that the system has a large effect size (ES = 0.83, p < 0.001) on learning effectiveness and a promising long-term knowledge retention (ES = 0.79, p < 0.001).

Our intention is to discuss the ideological function of these biological concepts as tools for the naturalization and scientific legitimation of racial hierarchies during that period. We argue that the examination of these scientific discussions about race from a historical perspective can play the role of a critical platform for students and teachers to think about the role of science in current othering processes, such as those related to biomedical technosciences. If they learn how biological ideas played an ideological function concerning interracial relationships in the past, they can be compelled to ask which ideological functions the biological knowledge they are teaching and learning might play now. If this is properly balanced, they can eventually both value scientific knowledge for its contributions and have a critical appraisal of some of its implications.

We wanted to design a project that exploits the idea of a hands-on relationship between mathematics and technology to teach students the concept of 'transmission coefficient' in schools. Our purpose was to bridge mathematical knowledge and mechanical parts in technological devices. Our belief was that visual-tangible representations enhance human cognition by scaffolding the information process. We supplied a kit with rubber foam (Fomi) and balsa wood parts to construct an analogical clock. This included a series of gears to work with three different ratios. The project was conducted in 2007 and 2008, with 38 students ranging from 10 to 14 years of age. The students were from the 5th and 7th grades in two different schools. The project included six stages of both theory and hands-on work. In a final stage, the students were given a written test. All students were able to make workable systems of their design for a time-measuring device. This proved important for technological education. On the other hand, manipulating gears along with visual reasoning strategies allowed all students to achieve an understanding of operations with fractions.

Our study found that gamification using a reward-based system is a strategy that can improve the educational experience under exceptional circumstances. This article reports the results of two gamified undergraduate courses (Calculus and Development of Transversal Competencies) designed with a reward system. The results derived from analyses of online surveys, the final grades, and their correlations revealed that gamification helped motivate students to participate actively and improved their academic performance, in a setting where the mode of instruction was remote, synchronous, and online. From the results we conclude that gamification favours the relationship between attention, participation, and performance, while promoting the humanisation of virtual environments created during academic confinement. Implications for practice or policy: · Gamification using a reward-based system promoted active class participation and improved student performance after the transition from face-to-face to virtual instruction required as a result of the global pandemic. Systemic recognition in a reward-based system improved the participants’ emotional states, reducing their anxiety and the feeling of isolation caused by the pandemic, and leading to student engagement with Gamification works as an accompaniment for students to help the increasement of teacher-student and student-student interactions. © 2021","academic confinement; game rewards; Gamification; innovative education; motivation",,,"The authors acknowledge the technical support of Writing Lab, Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in the production of this work.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122588226

The purpose of this study was to determine technical and pedagogical readiness of faculty and students for the feasibility of offering online medical courses. Methods: This case study was conducted on the main campus of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (Ecuador) using both quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry. Data were gathered using online readiness surveys of faculty (10) and students (25), semi-structured interviews with each faculty member, and a focus group interview of eight students. Results: Based on the descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis, faculty and students had positive attitudes toward online courses and overall were prepared in technological readiness. However, the faculty’s knowledge about online teaching pedagogy and instructional design was insufficient. The results also showed several positive aspects of assessing readiness for online education and provided key information for developing solutions to the problems and challenges faculty and students may face in initiating online medical education. Time and budget were reported as the two biggest barriers to develop and implement online courses. Conclusion: Assessing the readiness of faculty and students to participate in online instruction can be challenging, but it is an essential step to get each individual’s input to address common needs and concerns. This process is very helpful in identifying critical success factors, choosing the right approach and applying timely strategies to ensure smooth transitions to new teaching and learning modalities. © 2012, Springer International Publishing.","Faculty Readiness; Online Medical Curriculum; Online Teaching and Learning; Student Readiness",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901021617

The conclusion reached is that, if international cooperation is to lead to an effective modernization of science education, a number of conditions have to be fulfilled: Didactic materials must be adapted to local needs and cannot simply be transplanted; there is a need to concentrate activities in the training of human resources; mechanisms for the diffusion of innovation have to be enlarged, and contacts be established between diverse groups that represent, pluralistically, the various tendencies in a certain field of work. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","The group of teachers and researchers that made up the FUNBEC team, in an attempt to make their programme feasible, started to produce prototypes of equipment to substitute for the existing equipment which, up to that time, had been imported from Europe. The search was for cheap and functional solutions, appropriate to the proposals for educational renewal and to the economic conditions of the country. As there were no industries in Brazil manufacturing science teaching materials, it was necessary to set up a factory to manufacture such materials and thus make them accessible to schools. The equipment was accompanied by instructions so that the teachers could organize practical work. Dissemination of the new methodologies and of the materials was carried out in courses held for teachers. This set of activities, which constituted FUNBEC'S work programme, was well underway when two things occurred that directly affected the Brazilian programme. One was the creation of the NSF (National Science Foundation) aimed at stimulating and financing basic research, initiating programmes to reinforce the scientific potential and to finance science education programmes. The second was the Soviet's scientific progress, symbolized by the launching of the Sputnik in 1959 (Gatewood and Obourn 1963). It was during this period which Hurd (1961) called a 'period of crisis in science education' that the embryos of the great curriculum projects, now known as 'alphabet soup', appeared and altered the evolution of scientific disciplines in the United States, and later, in the regions under the influence of this cultural domain. In the 1960s, the curriculum projects (Welch 1979) reached their peak and began to inspire changes that went beyond the range of science education and geographical frontiers. International organizations such as the OEA and UNESCO 'intensified their programmes aimed at stimulating the improvement of science education on the preuniversity level in developing countries' (Baez 1976).

Using Google images, we automatically and objectively examined 723,600 frames from the recordings where the classroom teacher appeared in the students' visual field. The results show that students' visual attention varies depending on four factors: (a) gender of the student, (b) age of the students, whether students are low/high attainers and (d) whether students are in English or Mathematics lessons. Surprisingly, students significantly paid more visual attention in their Mathematics than in English lessons. High attainers were more visually engaged than their low attainers counterparts.

Most studies have focused so far on the integration of UX theories and methods with agile practices. The objective of this research is to investigate whether and how UX information is embedded in the daily work of an agile team. We conducted an ethnographic study of an agile team based in the UK. We performed a qualitative analysis using different data sources and three complementary analytical lenses: Distributed Cognition of Teamwork, Garrett's set of UX elements and planes, and Hassenzahl's content-oriented model of UX. This combination provided an understanding of the different types of UX information available to the agile team through artefacts and face-to-face meetings, how the information flowed within and around the agile team, and the type of engagement they have with UX information. The findings reveal that: (1) agile team members were consumers of UX information not producers; (2) the most common type of UX information found in the system related to how the user interacts with the product rather than to user goals or needs; (3) information focusing on the user perspective appears in verbal communication rather than being captured in artefacts; and, (4) the flow of UX information around the team is complex. In combination, these factors indicate a potential breakdown in the communication of UX information. We argue that these findings have relevance for other agile teams because the artefacts and methods used by this team are commonly used by other agile teams. To improve the situation, we suggest a number of recommendations to engage agile team members in UX work, and reduce the complexity of UX information flow. © 2020","Agile team; Cognitive system; Communication; DiCoT; Distributed cognition; Information flow; User experience/UX information","Software design; Agile software development; Distributed cognition; Ethnographic study; Face-to-face meetings; Information flows; Qualitative analysis; User experience design; Verbal communications; User experience",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097335016

Such constraints have often limited public engagement and may have slowed the uptake of ocean science into environmental policy. Recognition of this disconnect has spurred a growing movement to promote ocean literacy, defined as one's individual understanding of how the ocean affects people and how people affect the ocean. Over the last 2 decades, this concept has gained significant traction in marine biology and environmental education circles and now plays a prominent role in the UN's Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030). Here, we argue that the ocean literacy agenda has largely been shaped and discussed by marine scientists and educators but needs to be expanded to a much larger constituency to be more effective, accessible and inclusive. We discuss diverse cultural settings from around the world and provide examples of indigenous, spiritual, art, ocean user and other groups that are already deeply engaged with the ocean and could provide a variety of perspectives to enrich the ocean literacy concept beyond an understanding of marine science. We suggest that such inclusiveness could remove the historic barriers that have surrounded the field, transform our collective awareness of and relationship with the ocean and help support ongoing efforts to restore marine biodiversity. © 2021 The authors.

Background End-users produce software in the labor market, and one of the challenges for End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) is the need to create functional software products without a formal education in software development. Methodology In this work, we present an instructional strategy to expose end-users to Ag-ile-based Software Engineering (SE) practices and enhance their ability to de-veloping high-quality software. Moreover, we introduce a SE approach for the collection of metrics to assess the effectiveness of the instructional strat-egy. We conducted two case studies to validate the effectiveness of our strat-egy; the comprehensive analysis of the outcome products evaluates the strat-egy and demonstrates how to interpret the collected metrics. Contribution This work contributes to the research and practitioner body of knowledge by leveraging SE centric concepts to design an instructional strategy to lay the foundations of SE competencies in inexperienced developers. This work pre-sents an instructional strategy to develop SE competencies through an inten-sive and time-bound structure that may be replicated. Moreover, the present work introduces a framework to evaluate these competencies from a prod-uct-centric approach, specialized for non-professional individuals. Finally, the framework contributes to understanding how to assess software quality when the software product is written in non-conventional, introductory program-ming languages. Findings The results show the effectiveness of our instructional strategy: teams were successful in constructing a working software product. However, participants did not display a good command of source code order and structure. Recommendations for Practitioners Our instructional strategy provides practitioners with a framework to lay foundations in SE competencies during intensive project-based events. Based on the results of our case studies, we provide a set of recommendations for educational practice. Recommendations for Researchers We propose an assessment framework to analyze the effectiveness of the in-structional strategy from a SE perspective. This analysis provides an overall picture of the participants' performance; other researchers could use our framework to evaluate the effectiveness of their activities, which would con-tribute to increasing the possibility of comparing the effectiveness of differ-ent instructional strategies. Impact on Society Given the number of end-user developers who create software products without a formal SE training, several professional and educational contexts can benefit from our proposed instructional strategy and assessment frame-work. Future Research Further research can focus on improving the assessment framework by in-cluding both process and product metrics to shed light on the effectiveness of the instructional strategies. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.","Assessment framework; Bootcamp; End-user software engineering; EUSE; Instructional strategy; Intensive project-based events",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087402599

The results show that the online learning rate of students who passed is greater than students who failed. The results of the person-centred analysis show that only test anxiety influences the number of nodes and arcs of the individual learning pathway network, which was modelled as individual networks. Also, engagement and disengagement affect these networks' features. This supports the conjecture that motivated students do not necessarily review more learning materials.

GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental knowledge for their future works as engineers.

To validate our genetic decomposition, we designed instruments that we applied to students from a secondary school mathematics teacher training program. Thus, and by using implicative statistics, we were able to confirm the mental constructions and mechanisms considered in our genetic decomposition. The results show lack of understanding of what a solution for a system is, difficulties in articulating the geometrical and algebraic aspects, and the convenience of using an alternative strategy in the case of systems of three or more linear equations. © 2019 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

Metaphors are mappings from a source domain (e.g., a stream) to a target domain (e.g., a sequence of bytes). Typically computing phenomena are explained using incoherent discourses at the source domain, formed by metaphors taken from a diversity of origins. Nonetheless, versatility of metaphors allows for the creation of coherent discourses in the origin domain that map the target computing discourse, and we call them allegories. The limited number of existing studies about this topic has compared only textual allegories, visual allegories, and the traditional unconnected metaphors. Although their findings are heterogeneous, equal effectiveness is the most frequent empirical result between these three types of metaphors. Furthermore, we have not found any study about oral allegories, in spite of oral being the most used modality for metaphors in computer science education. This article experimentally compares the effects of oral allegories and oral metaphors on a complex problem-solving task. As in previous studies, our results did not find any significant differences on support or detriment of oral allegories. Our results support new metaphor theories posing that the context significantly influences the metaphors’ efficacy, and encourages future research about the interaction between context and allegories. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","allegory; experiment; metaphor; problem solving","Abstracting; Computation theory; Education computing; Experiments; Abstract concept; Allegory; Complex problem solving tasks; Computer Science Education; Metaphor; Programming problem; Target domain; Problem solving","Universidad de Costa Rica, UCR; Ministerio de Ciencia TecnologÃ­a y Telecomunicaciones, MICITT","This research is supported by the Centro de Investigaciones en Tecnolog?as de la Informaci?n y Comunicaci?n (CITIC), the Escuela de Ciencias de la Computaci?n e Inform?tica (ECCI), both from Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), and the Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnolog?a y Telecomunicaciones de Costa Rica (MICITT).

CS aims to acquire a signal with sparse or compressible representation in a suitable domain, using a number of samples under the limit established by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The application consists of a graphical user interface in MATLAB, and a low-cost FPGA Xilinx Spartan 6, which in that way form a powerful and low-cost design station adequate to perform a number of CS experiments. Reconstruction of signals is carried out using a Greedy algorithm which solves the underdetermined system in real time with a novel Chebyshev-type matrix inversion. Effects related to the number of samples defined in the measurement matrix, and the use of different spaces, such as Discrete Cosine Transform, or Discrete Wavelet Transform, can be easily studied with the described tool. Results derived from its use in graduate courses are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Chebyshev; compressed sensing; compression; CoSaMP; FPGA; signal acquisition","Compaction; Costs; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphical user interfaces; Matrix algebra; Signal reconstruction; Signal sampling; Chebyshev; Compressive sensing; CoSaMP; Educational platforms; Measurement matrix; Shannon Sampling Theorem; Signal acquisitions; Underdetermined systems; Compressed sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945485928

A simple one‐dimensional lumped‐based formulation enabled the determination of the mean bulk and wall temperature distributions of the internal fluid flow as well as the total rate of heat transfer between two axial stations in the region of thermal development. Streamwise‐mean values for the internal and circumferential‐mean values for the external Nusselt numbers have been taken from standard correlations reported in undergraduate textbooks on heat transfer, leading to the immediate calculation of a mean, equivalent Nusselt number, which serves to regulate the thermal interaction between the two fluid streams. Representative results for a complete combination of internal and external fluids, expressed in terms of their respective thermal conductivity ratios, are discussed at length. The thermal quantities were computed with a pocket‐size calculator and compared favorably with those based on a more general and rigorous two‐dimensional differential formulation. The latter was utilized as a baseline solution, and inevitably required a finite‐difference procedure on a personal computer.

These institutions all offer “online education” with diverse institutional, technological, and pedagogical processes. However, a fundamental element has to do with the experience of the students, and how they adapt to the educational model of the online university in which they are studying. In this article, we present the main results of the case-study developed in one of the most historical and relevant virtual universities in an international context. We have explored and analysed the process of adaptation to the educational model by the student body, and their perceptions of their interactions with the pedagogical, institutional, and technological elements designed to support their learning. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to gather and analyse the data. From 1715 students who participated in the survey and the perceptions of 30 students individually interviewed, the results show positive evaluations regarding the integration and adoption of technological competencies, and also, that the online education generally serves as a responsive model to the emergent needs of the learner. However, the results also show that students have important concerns regarding the pedagogical and institutional support provided. © 2021, The Author(s).","Autonomous learning; Competences in digital technologies; Digital divide; Online education; Student support",,"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: 72090564","Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

One of the challenges of this modality is that students need access to devices such as laptops and smartphones. Among these options, smartphones are the most accessible because of their lower price. This study analyzes the usage patterns of smartphone users of undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional descriptive study included 365 students: 162 (44.4%) women and 203 (55.6%) men from a Chilean university. The results revealed that students often accessed the learning management system (LMS) with their computers rather than with their smartphones. Students were connected to the LMS for more hours on their computers than on their smartphones. However, they spent more hours simultaneously connected on their computers and smartphones than just on their computers. During the day, students accessed the LMS mainly from 13:00 to 1:00. The number of connections decreased from 1:00 to 8:00 and increased from 8:00 to 13:00. The LMS resource that students accessed the most using smartphones was discussion forums, while the one they accessed the least was wiki pages.

Using data envelopment analysis, we sought to identify technical efficiency measures reached by 74 nations in the relative use of these inputs and measure the existence of possible leftovers of inefficient inputs at the end proposed here. The results elucidate the global context of the sub-optimal application of spending on R&D and the number of researchers in different degrees in time and space, which confirms the hypothesis suggested in this investigation. In this direction, some seem to seek readjustments in the bases of these inputs, moving, each period, to the most efficient specific combinations, whereas others, however, follow the opposite path. This occurs in all income strata and, therefore, regardless of economic size. However, it is still in the poorest countries that there is the greatest risk of the non-optimal use of research inputs in the sense of producing new patented technological inventions, although this is also the reality of some wealthy nations on the planet. This mismatch between the potential capacity for the production of legally protected knowledge and the one effectively used, which makes technological progress—under the mechanism of the intellectual property of these economies—increasingly late and more complex, significantly weakening the displacement of the frontier of the codifiable and its beneficial dissemination on intellectual property systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Innovation output; Research inputs; Technical efficiency","Data envelopment analysis; Developing countries; Economics; Efficiency; Maximum Efficiency; Optimal applications; Potential capacity; Potential production; Research and development; Technical efficiency; Technological inventions; Technological progress; Intellectual property; data envelopment analysis; industrial production; innovation; intellectual property rights; knowledge; research and development; technical change","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa e à Inovação Tecnológica do Estado de Sergipe, FAPITEC-SE; Universidade Federal de Sergipe, UFS","Jose Ricardo de Santana , Co-author analytical reviewer, Associate Professor at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), PhD in Business Economics from the Getúlio Vargas Foundation - SP, linked to the Department of Economics, the Graduate Program in Economics and the Graduate Program in Intellectual Property Science.

We seek to understand how non-institutional initiatives on digital platforms affect the perspectives of democracy. To reach our goal we employed an empirical exploratory case study of Brazil. We present two non-institutional initiatives developed indigenously – “Nosso Mandato” and “Poder do Voto”. We handled in-depth interviews, conducted participant observation, and subsequently supplemented the analysis with secondary materials. Our investigation demonstrates those two non-institutional platforms target Brazilian democratic deficit and in some way they both aim at transforming the country's politics by creating new mechanisms for political participation and by fostering a change in the political culture. More specifically, they reinforce trends of direct digital democracy, truth-based advocacy and constituent mobilization. On the other hand, both platforms are still struggling to leverage network externalities to their advantage – and the barriers are both economic (financial and organizational) and political. They represent a movement that believes it can change politics by creating new spaces for social mobilization via technology, even if built on the digital services of a global oligopoly. We found initial evidence that points to two important points in the relationship between digital platforms and democracy: (i) specific digital platforms for political participation face greater difficulty in scaling up the number of users than general purpose social networks; (ii) the most successful initiatives in terms of non-institutional digital platforms for political participation are based on, and thus strengthen, the Big Five global oligopoly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Digital platforms; Nosso Mandato; Poder do Voto; Political transformation; Technological progress","Education; Exploratory case studies; In-depth interviews; Network externality; Participant observations; Political participations; Secondary materials; Socio-economic model; Technological progress; Competition; democracy; digitization; empirical analysis; political development; political participation; political system; technological development; Brazil","Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Midas; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação, MCTI: 01240.000655/2020-70; Ministério da Educação, MEC: 88882.329792/2019-01; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações, MCTIC","This work was supported by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) , Ministério da Educação (MEC) [Processo 88882.329792/2019-01].

This is because it allows the expression of several problems related to digital design, artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages, among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in any place. It additionally increases the learners’ motivation by including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the students’ level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","blended learning; Boolean algebra; education; gamification; web-based education","Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Formal languages; Gamification; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Websites; Academic performance; Discrete mathematics; Experimental groups; Formal Experiments; Higher education institutions; Reinforce learning; Teaching-learning method; Web-based softwares; Boolean algebra","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","The authors would like to thank Michel Olvera, Alan Cruz, and Jorge Arreygue for participating in the development of MiniBool.

Public managers have thus considered Progress Testing scores potentially useful as part of the final decision in the medical residency selection process. We analyzed whether there is a correlation between students’ Progress Testing scores and their performances in medical residency selection. We examined four subsequent cohorts of students who attempted Progress Testing yearly and compared their accumulated scores with their medical residency selection scores from Botucatu Medical School, Universidade Estadual Paulista. We included 212 students who finished the 6-year medical course in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The comparison between the area under the Progress Testing curve and the medical residency selection score was performed using a Pearson correlation, with a p value set at < 0.05. We found a positive association between the two scores (p < 0.05 for the 4 years). Next, the students were grouped according to their performance in Progress Testing: above one, within one, and below one standard deviation. A chi-square test was used to compare the rates of approval with the second step of the medical residency selection process. Approval rates were 91.7%, 69.2%, and 42.1%, respectively (p < 0.05). We conclude that, in fact, there is a correlation between students’ performance on these measures. This is partially explained by the fact that both instruments measure cognitive competencies and knowledge.

In this paper, we exploit code quality tools and metrics to automatically assess student projects with respect to methods with many responsibilities (i.e., where the Extract Method refactoring should be applied), and evaluate their effectiveness. We conducted a study using two sets of student projects, developed in two academic semesters. Our results indicate that, to reduce the effort required to grade projects, two traditional code metrics, namely method lines of code and number of statements, perform best, and other metrics can be selected according to the system being implemented. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: As this paper is a comparative literature review, the methodology involved three stages. Initially, a documentary analysis was carried out to identify the texts published during the past five years – since 2013 – reporting a categorization of experiences and cases of international INFOLIT programs and their corresponding lessons learned. Second, we conducted a content analysis of these publications to uncover the classification, identification and frequency of the lessons learned. A third comparative step consisted of analyzing the similarities of these lessons when compared to those reported in similar research on Ibero-American universities (Uribe-Tirado, 2013). Findings: From the 75 lessons learned from INFOLIT programs in Ibero-American universities, 65 lessons (87 per cent) were identified as also present in universities elsewhere. These similarities give an account of the possibilities for collaborative learning and benchmarking that INFOLIT programs could achieve with regard to content, pedagogy, learning objects and evaluation if there were more networking and more common participation in sharing experiences, with appropriate adaptations to contextual, technological and idiomatic variations. Originality/value: As a comparative literature review, this paper makes a significant contribution to the international advancement of INFOLIT in higher education, as it correlates the lessons learned from INFOLIT programs in Ibero-American universities with those from other countries.

This can lead to students' undesired behaviors, like gaming the system, associated with low performance. In this paper, the authors aim at evaluating if the gestures of an animated pedagogical agent to explain hints related to equation solving improves the students' understanding of these help messages. With this goal, they developed an animated pedagogical agent that uses gestures coupled with messages to explain hints in an algebra tutor. The authors performed a qualitative pilot study with four students to verify the impact of using gestures by the animated pedagogical agent on the comprehension of the hints, using two different versions of the system. The difference between these versions was the availability of gestures by the agent. The results showed that students understood the hints provided by the agent more correctly when they were coupled with agent's gesture. Furthermore, they also preferred using the tutor version with gestures.

However, he did not participate in the movement transforming concepts and methods which crystallized in a new order of geometry at the beginning of the nineteenth century. On the contrary, throughout his life Bolzano tried to demonstrate Euclid's postulate of parallel lines. Two ontological convictions played the role of epistemological obstacle for Bolzano and prevented him even from imagining the possibility that non-Euclidean geometries might exist. In the first place, Bolzano thought that Euclidean geometry had an intrinsic structure and thus geometrical space must be intrinsically Euclidean. Secondly, the description of this structure contained the existence of an ""objective"" connection between geometrical truths; a basic truth was, by its nature, ""simple and general"".

Literally, one particular case corresponds to external forced convective cooling, which is invariant with the tube orientation. Another particular case corresponds to external natural convection cooling, which depends on the tube orientation. For both cases, a simple one-dimensional (1-D) lumped formulation enabled the determination of the mean bulk and wall temperature distributions of the internal fluid flow as well as the total rate of heat transfer in a finite tube length within the region of thermal development. Streamwise-mean values for the internal Nusselt numbers have been taken from standard correlation equations reported in undergraduate textbooks on heat transfer. Meanwhile, streamwise-mean values for the external Nusselt numbers have been extracted from articles published in the open literature. The combination of both Nusselt numbers leads to the calculation of a streamwise-mean, equivalent Nusselt number, which serves to regulate the thermal interaction between the two fluid streams. Representative results for a selected combination of internal and external fluids, expressed in terms of their thermal conductivity ratios, are discussed at length. The computed thermal quantities (global and local) based on a 1-D lumped model compared favorably with those based on a more general and rigorous 2-D differential model, which inevitably necessitated a finite-difference methodology and a personal computer. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","External natural convection; In-tube forced convection; Lumped-based model","Calculations; Computer simulation; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Nusselt number; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Tubes (components); External natural convection; Lumped based model; Natural convection",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030678729

We investigated whether the quality of debriefing in using simulation-based training in team training correlated with the degree of learning of participants. Methods Forty-two teams of medical and undergraduate nursing students participated in simulation-based training sessions using a two-scenario format with after-action debriefing. Observers rated team performance with an 11-item Teamwork Assessment Scales (TAS) instrument (three subscales, team-based behaviours (5-items), shared mental model (3-items), adaptive communication and response (3-items)). Two independent, blinded raters evaluated video-recorded facilitator team prebriefs and debriefs using the Objective Structured Assessment of Debriefing (OSAD) 8-item tool. Descriptive statistics were calculated, t-test comparisons made and multiple linear regression and univariate analysis used to compare OSAD item scores and changes in TAS scores. Results Statistically significant improvements in all three TAS subscales occurred from scenario 1 to 2. Seven faculty teams taught learners with all scores ≥3.0 (except two) for prebriefs and all scores ≥ 3.5 (except one) for debriefs (OSAD rating 1=done poorly to 5=done well). Linear regression analysis revealed a single statistically significant correlation between debrief engagement and adaptive communication and response score without significance on univariate analysis. Conclusions Quality of debriefing does not seem to increase the degree of learning in interprofessional education using simulation-based training of prelicensure student teams. Such a finding may be due to the relatively high quality of the prebrief and debrief of the faculty teams involved in the training. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Methodology: In step 1, a bibliographic research was performed in books and journals and also a documentary research by laws, decrees and government websites on accessibility. In stage 2, the 11 Federal Universities of the State of Minas Gerais were selected as a sample, where the number of students enrolled was requested, by e-mail and Fala.BR platform, as well as the number of students who declare themselves with some type of disability. In stage 3, an automatic web accessibility assessment was performed on the library websites of the 11 institutions of the sample using the Website Accessibility Simulator Assistant (ASES) e; heuristic assessment of Web accessibility by means of accessibility guidelines creating, at the end of the heuristic evaluation, a list of seven elements already implemented or that could be implemented on the libraries' websites, namely: 1) accessibility description; 2) jump menu; 3) contrast; 4) font size; 5) keyboard navigation; 6) Vlibras and; 7) text audio. Results: The survey indicated a low percentage of People with Disabilities enrolled in Minas Gerais universities, when compared to the 2010 Census. However, this is no reason for universities to stop improving web accessibility features on their respective websites. On the contrary, universities can develop accessible resources that meet different needs/levels of People with Disabilities. Conclusion: The combination of evaluation techniques, automatic and heuristic are fundamental for a more complete analysis of Web accessibility. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

This is achieved by collecting data about student interactions from the Moodle learning management system (LMS), and subsequently applying supervised machine learning models to infer the gap between students in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Design/methodology/approach: This work uses the well-established Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology, which comprises six phases, viz., problem understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and implementation. In this case, student data was collected from the Moodle platform from the Antioquia campus of the UNAD distance learning university. Findings: The digital divide is evident in the classification model when observing differences in variables such as the number of accesses to the LMS, the total time spent and the number of distinct IP addresses used, as well as the number of system modification events. Originality/value: This study provides conclusions regarding the problems students in virtual education may face as a result of the digital divide in Colombia which have become increasingly visible since the implementation of machine learning methodologies on LMS such as Moodle. However, these practices may be replicated in any virtual educational context and furthermore be extended to enable personalisation of various aspects of the Moodle platform to meet the individual needs of students. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behaviour; Classification; Course management systems; digital divide; Distance learning; Geographic information systems; Learning analytics; Learning management systems; Machine learning; Modelling; Supervised learning",,"Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GACR;GAČR: 201/04/1153, MSM0021622419","Support of the grants GAČR 201/04/1153 and MSM0021622419 is acknowledged",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111037834

We emphasised inverse missing-value problems by analysing them according to the type of unknown and the representation used. We checked which strategies they use to solve them and related them to other generic problems of proportional reasoning. For such purposes, we used a combined quantitative and qualitative empirical study applied to how pre-service teachers solve fifteen problems. The results show that the representations used in the statements aid their understanding and help solve the problems.

The main research question is whether innovative interfaces affect test response time and/or response accuracy. This study compared performance on banked cloze tests using a conventional interface (based on paper-based formats for responding by writing a number in a box) versus cloze tests with improved interfaces (based on computer-based affordances such as dragging and dropping responses to fill in a blank). In a banked cloze test, the left side of the page shows a text with words deleted and replaced with blanks that are numbered, and the right side shows the word list with a space to write in the corresponding number. In Experiment 1, 56 fourth graders in the conventional group responded more slowly but just as accurately, and spent more time looking at the word list on the right of the screen but spent equivalent time looking at the text as compared to a group that took the test with an improved interface. In Experiment 2, the same pattern of results was replicated with 148 sixth graders and for each of three versions of improved interfaces as compared to the conventional interface. Results support the idea that the improved interface affected the response execution phase but not the response development phase of performance on the cloze test. © 2020, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Cloze test; Cognitive load; Computer-administered test; Drag-and-drop interface; Technology-enhanced items",,"Universidad de Santiago de Chile; Departamento de Investigaciones Científicas y Tecnológicas, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, DICYT: 061863PA","This study was partially funded by the Universidad de Santiago de Chile through Grant DICYT # 061863PA.

Procedural Content Generation (PCG) can remedy some of these problems, aiding with the automatic creation of content such as levels and graphics, in both the development and playing time. However, little research has been performed in terms of how PCG influences players, especially on Digital Math Games (DMG). This article addresses this problem by investigating the interactions of players with a DMG that uses PCG, investigating the hypothesis that interacting with this intervention can provide experiences as good as human-designed content. To accomplish this goal, an A/B test was performed wherein the only difference was that one version (static, N = 242) had human-designed levels, whereas the other (dynamic, N = 265) provided procedurally generated levels. To validate the approach, a two-sample experiment was designed in which each sample played a single version and, thereafter, self-reported their experiences through questionnaires. We contribute by showing how the participants interactions with a DMG are reported in terms of (1) fun, (2) willingness to play the game again, and (3) curiosity, in addition to how they (4) describe their experiences. Our findings show that samples’ experiences did not significantly differ on the four metrics, but did differ on in-game performance. We discuss possible factors that might have influenced players’ experiences, in terms of the participants performances and their demographic attributes, and how our findings contribute to human interaction with computers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","A/B test; Digital Math Game; Player experience; Procedural content generation; Serious game; User experience","Budget control; Surveys; Automatic creations; Game contents; Game development; Human interactions; Human levels; Multi-disciplinary teams; Procedural content generations; Software design","April/2018; CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES","L.

Mixed methods were used to enable data from qualitative and quantitative instruments to be obtained. A quasi-experimental design was specified, employing non-probabilistic sampling, with a control (N = 40) and experimental group (N = 39). In comparing PBL with traditional methods, the results reveal statistically significant differences in aspects such as academic performance. Teamwork, oral communication, written communication and students’ perceptions of the learning experience were also all favoured. Nonetheless, lack of adequate team dynamics in previous learning experiences and reluctance to change traditional teaching approaches, could compromise the viability of that proposed. © (2020).

The survey about the scientific publications developed in the Graduate Program in Science, Technology and Society of the Federal University of São Carlos was based on bibliometric analysis of the main terms present in the titles and keywords of publications, such as scientific papers, thesis, dissertations and book chapters of professors and students of the program. By using tables, graphs and word clouds, the main terms pointed out by the doctoral students from the 2018 class were represented, as well as the number of publications per year, since the beginning of the Program (2008 - 2016), and the diversity of themes in which the study is inserted, which allowed an analysis of the profile of the research performed so far. It was concluded that there has been a significant increase in Program's publications with respect to scientific papers published in the most diverse journals. Regarding book chapters, there has been a decrease in publications, probably due to the Program's incentive for researchers to publish papers in high-impact scientific journals. The study also showed a higher number of female than male students, and an equivalent number of men and women among advisor in the Program.

This can be derived from the inherent complexity of Knowledge Management and the organizational environment. However, there is a need for a model that is unifying and that addresses Knowledge Management in a holistic way, but the characteristics that should be considered for this approach have not yet been consolidated. Thus, this study proposes to investigate which aspects should be contemplated in new KM (Knowledge Management) models towards a holistic approach. Through a qualitative methodological course of exploratory nature and with a bibliographic research technique, this research presents, by results, the synthesis of these aspects, based on three perspectives: limitations of existing models, its gaps, and support theories to Knowledge Management. For limitation, one understands that these aspects have not been validated by specialists, which is a suggestion of future research, as well as the development of a Knowledge Management model that comprehends all these aspects. This study contributes by outlining aspects to be contemplated in holistic Knowledge Management models in order to allow this theme to consider all the inherent complexity of the organizational environment. © 2019 RDBCI: Rev.

We propose the use of computational methods to assist the creation of terminological neologisms that will constitute new STEM dictionaries. More specifically, we propose the use of computer vision algorithms for shape extraction and description from the visual representation (illustration) of a signless technical concept, as well as natural language processing methods for determining the stem of its corresponding oral term. By comparing those pieces of information of the signless technical concept with the corresponding ones of general-purpose signs in a repository, our approach creates a meaningful new sign from the existing ones with similar features. As far as we know, this is the first computer-aided proposal to create new signs and deal with the problem of technical vocabulary absence in sign languages, making the process of sign creation more agile and scalable. To validate the created technical signs, an evaluation committee composed by fluent signers considers aspects such as, the phonetic, phonological, and morphological structures of the sign language. Experiments were performed with technical concepts of the architectural drawing area, for which new signs in the Brazilian Sign Language were created. The results are promising with 60% of the new signs being rated on a five-point scale with a similar satisfaction level of signs of a reference dataset. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","computational approach; sign languages; STEM dictionaries; terminological neologisms","Architectural design; Computational methods; Natural language processing systems; Terminology; Architectural drawings; Computational approach; Computer vision algorithms; Morphological structures; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Sign language; Terminological neologisms; Visual representations; Visual languages","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 313163/2014-6; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG: PPM-00542-15","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Grant number: 313163/2014-6; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, Grant number: PPM-00542-15",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041223387

Mixed methods were used, where we sent a survey to all the principal investigators (PIs) doing research in health-oriented biotechnology at Cinvestav that we could identify and asked them about their transfer of technologies activities, and interviews were carried out with those PIs who are currently pursuing projects for commercialization. Our results show that, despite a strong publishing record on the international front, most of these scientists lack a business-oriented focus. Further business expertise does not appear to be readily available or helpful at the institutional technology transfer office. Weak collaboration strategies reflected in a low number of key partnerships, together with a lack of private financing, also limit the capacity to transfer and commercialize the technologies being generated. The local scientific tradition and conditions do not seem to be amenable to these kinds of efforts, nor does the government pursue a coherent strategy to promote technology transfer and commercialization in health biotechnology. Consequently, promising projects take too long to develop and usually go to a limited extent through the consecutive patenting and licensing steps, both indicators of commercial activity in academia. The end result is a lack of success in making the results of new scientific knowledge beneficial for public health, a problem experienced not only by Mexico but shared by a number of low-and-middle income countries.

As a first step towards bridging this gap, we carried out a literature review regarding the multiple types of interactions offered by GUI of IG software. We searched five digital libraries and collected 998 papers covering more than ten years (2004-2014) of research in the field. As a result we verified that: 1) most of the studies focused on desktop interfaces based on keyboard and mouse; 2) few efforts have been carried out on the design of IG software for devices with multitouch interfaces.

The aim was to analyze the participation of the National Federation members of the Pan-American Gymnastics Union (PAGU) in the 14th edition of the WG, held in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2011. The data collection was made by a semi-structured questionnaire with eight of heads of delegation of the eleven participating American national federation. The results highlight the largest delegations were Brazil, Canada and the USA, respectively, countries which also traditionally participate in this festival. The participants were majority female (74,5%) and the performance were strongly influenced by Artistic and Rhythmic gymnastics disciplines, as well as Dance. PAGU participation has increased in compare with past editions of the WG, ranking it as second in terms of continent with the largest number of participants (6,64%). Although the participation is strongly related to the economic factors, considering all the WG editions held in Europe. We conclude that non-competitive gymnastics still treat secondarily for most PAGU Member Federations, since they are focus on competitive gymnastics disciplines and especially on their national teams. © 2015 University of Ljubljana.

This article analyzes aspects of meaning-making of ray associated to the use of the definition as warrant. This analysis is rooted in the Peircean triadic sign and in the evolution of the teacher and learners' interpretants while they made the effort to operationalize such definition.

Addressing these questions led us to outline a framework that aims to characterise ways in which multiple purpose technologies and ad hoc technologies can be used in problem solving approaches.

It presents the assessment of the Virtual Community Work (CVT) used in the Popular Healthcare Education Policy (PNEPS). Design/methodology/approach – The exploratory research adopted two paths of analysis, one quantitative (using questionnaire) aimed to collect the participants’ perceptions regarding the navigation, tools and features of CVT, and the other qualitative through observation of the interventions in its different spaces, having discourse analysis as the technique for analysis. Findings – The hands-on nature of Popular Education, revealed in the posts and in the speech of the participants, showed the potential and challenges of the territory and the need for change, both of the professional’s outlook on his or her own work process and working with health in the communities that are, still today, very centered around authoritarian models. Research limitations/implications – Because the participation was not mandatory, the reduced number of participants was the main limitation of this work. Practical implications – The health problems specified in the interactions and much discussed in CVT may help the consolidation of the policy as the main practical implication. Social implications – Contribute to the creation of a network for the exchange of educational experiences in the field of Popular Education. Originality/value – The innovating character of this work lies in the application of Virtual Community in the field of popular education within the health sector as a strategy for implementation of a national policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Assessment; Communities; E-Learning; Online applications; Research",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927602406

The analysis was guided by the Dual Coding Theory posed by Sadoski & Paivio (2004). The results show that, while there exists a great deal of uniformity within one area (Physics or Calculus), there exist discrepancies between areas. The second part of this work deals with the symbolic-symbolic translation that students are able to carry out when having learned Gauss Theorem with a symbolic system that is different from the one used in Physics.

Most studies analyzing this effect focused on extrinsic game elements, while fictional and collaborative competition have been recently recommended. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no long-term research has been carried out with STEM learners from introductory programming courses (CS1), a context that demands encouraging practice and mitigating motivation throughout the semester. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to better understand how the impact of a gamification design, featuring fictional and competitive-collaborative elements, changes over a 14-week period of time, when applied to CS1 courses taken by STEM students (N = 756). In an ecological setting, we followed a 2x7 quasi-experimental design, where Brazilian STEM students completed assignments in either a gamified or non-gamified version of the same system, which provided the measures (number of attempts, usage time, and system access) to assess user behavior at seven points in time. Results indicate changes in gamification’s impact that appear to follow a U-shaped pattern. Supporting the novelty effect, the gamification’s effect started to decrease after four weeks, decrease that lasted between two to six weeks. Interestingly, the gamification’s impact shifted to an uptrend between six and 10 weeks after the start of the intervention, partially recovering its contribution naturally. Thus, we found empirical evidence supporting that gamification likely suffers from the novelty effect, but also benefits from the familiarization effect, which contributes to an overall positive impact on students. These findings may provide some guidelines to inform practitioners about how long the initial contributions of gamification last, and how long they take to recover after some reduction in benefits. It can also help researchers to realize when to apply/evaluate interventions that use gamification by taking into consideration the novelty effect and, thereby, better understand the real impact of gamification on students’ behavior in the long run. © 2022, The Author(s).","Education; Gameful; Learning; Quasi-experiment Repeated-measures",,"001/2020, 003/2019, 8.387/1991; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2013/07375-0, 2018/15917- 0, 6.008/2006; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 141859/2019-9, 163932/2020-4, 308458/2020-6, 308513/2020-7; Universidade Federal de Alagoas, UFAL","This research was partially funded by the following organizations: Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)—processes 141859/2019-9, 163932/2020-4, 308458/2020-6, and 308513/2020-7; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; and São Paulo State Research Support Foundation (FAPESP)—processes 2018/15917- 0 and 2013/07375-0.

While Coursera, edX, Udacity, and FutureLearn received most of the attention and scrutiny, an entirely new ecosystem of local MOOC providers was growing in parallel. This ecosystem is harder to study than the major players: they are spread around the world, have less staff devoted to maintaining research data, and operate in multiple languages with university and corporate regional partners. To better understand how online learning opportunities are expanding through this regional MOOC ecosystem, we created a research partnership among 15 different MOOC providers from nine countries. We gathered data from over eight million learners in six thousand MOOCs, and we conducted a large-scale survey with more than 10 thousand participants. From our analysis, we argue that these regional providers may be better positioned to meet the goals of expanding access to higher education in their regions than the better-known global providers. To make this claim we highlight three trends: first, regional providers attract a larger local population with more inclusive demographic profiles; second, students predominantly choose their courses based on topical interest, and regional providers do a better job at catering to those needs; and third, many students feel more at ease learning from institutions they already know and have references from. Our work raises the importance of local education in the global MOOC ecosystem, while calling for additional research and conversations across the diversity of MOOC providers. © 2022 The Authors","Cultural factors; Distance learning; Educational data mining; Equity; Large scale analytics; Learning analytics; Massive open online courses","Data mining; E-learning; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Surveys; Cultural factors; Distance-learning; Educational data mining; English languages; Equity; Large-scale analytics; Learning analytic; Massive open online course; Media attention; Research data; Students","IJC2020-044852-I; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Labex: ANR-11-LABX-0047; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","We would like to thank support from the MIT-SPAIN program sponsored by “la Caixa” Foundation SEED FUND .

This article reports on a study that was done over a period of 3 years to explicate the instructional processes involved in teaching an undergraduate CRE. One hundred and two instructors from the established and large multi-institutional SEA-PHAGES program were surveyed for their understanding of the aims and practices of CRE teaching. This was followed by large-scale feedback sessions with the cohort of instructors at the annual SEA Faculty Meeting and subsequently with a small focus group of expert CRE instructors. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, the survey data were analyzed for the aims of inquiry instruction and pedagogical practices used to achieve these goals. The results characterize CRE inquiry teaching as involving three instructional models: 1) being a scientist and generating data; 2) teaching procedural knowledge; and 3) fostering project ownership. Each of these models is explicated and visualized in terms of the specific pedagogical practices and their relationships. The models present a complex picture of the ways in which CRE instruction is conducted on a daily basis and can inform instructors and institutions new to CRE teaching.",,"educational model; engineering; human; mathematics; student; teaching; university; Engineering; Faculty; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Educational; Students; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123230901

This study aims to examine the perceived usability of the gamified educational platform called (ELORS) in relation to online behaviour. As well as analyse the clustering models in terms of their high and low level of engagement through their interaction metrics. A quantitative, descriptive correlational approach and an educational data analysis design was adopted through the K-means algorithm. The participants were 51 students in mathematics in the second year of secondary education. An instrument was used to evaluate usability and behavioural metrics, analysing 1065 interactions with 57 activities. The results showed advantages in usability and grouping. The level of usability achieved depends on the interaction of the users with the different learning objects and their moderate relationship in their interactions. In relation to the centroids, two groups are evidenced by number of attempts and interactions, identifying students with low levels of participation in the minority. A significant finding is given in relation to the preference of redeeming virtual values in gold from the diamonds collected. The perspective of the analysis allows identifying the potential of the gamified platform to work online in the formation of mathematical competence according to the current educational curriculum. © 2022, International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

The aim of this study is to contribute to the state of knowledge regarding the instructional techniques and tools reported as being used by teachers to develop digital abilities. To such an end, a systematized literature review was conducted. For the extraction of articles, a specific search code was used within the Web of Science All Collections, including SciELO, databases. Without setting a year-limit, and concluding the search on the 24 of April 2021, 613 articles were found. Sixty cleared selection criterion and, ultimately, 17 contributed to the purpose of the review. Findings show that a majority of articles report on classroom interventions and not on classroom observations. Additionally, they also suggest that six instructional techniques were employed by all studies: analyzing multiple perspectives of a same learning assignment, using authentic problems, collaboration, providing feedback, giving progressive autonomy to students and asking them to share their work. Regarding methodology, a preferred approach is the use of pre-post test design with a small number of cases and where non-probabilistic sampling and self-reported questionaries are favored. © 2022, Beijing Normal University.","Digital abilities; Literature review; Teaching/learning techniques; Twenty-first century abilities",,,"This work was supported by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile’s Vice-Rectorship for Research who provides scholarships to doctoral students of the University.",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125471710

They are embracing broader societal issues, especially in a time of population and environmental stress. In this paper, we focus on museum staff perspectives about the exhibition Our World (Canada), that delves into issues of water, food and energy consumption, and waste. Specifically, we sought to explore expectations and tensions that framed the renovation of the exhibit and to interpret them through theory related to scientific literacy and exhibition typologies. Using case study, we relied primarily on semi-structured interviews with museum staff, and secondarily on observations, field notes, and documents. Our findings are organized around: the renovation of narratives and forms of representation, and the ways in which the visitor experience is reimagined. The (re)conceptualization of this gallery illustrates an attempt to move from a pedagogical to critical and agential emphases, through which progressive views of scientific literacy could be at play. Our discussion examines the role of information, the in-between positions that museum staffers experienced and pathways towards civic responsibility.

Traditionally it is composed of dynamics, mechanics, and components. The purpose of this study was to compare Engineering and Economics and Social Sciences undergraduate students in their performance (grades), motivation, quality of assignments, participation, and emotion when their teachers used gamification as an innovative teaching method during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mann–Whitney test were conducted. Additionally, four students were interviewed to describe the emotional downside of the lockdown. The main results indicate that there are higher positive relationships among variables in the Engineering undergraduate students rather than in Economics and Social Sciences and show that emotion poorly correlates with performance, especially for the Economics and Social Sciences students, as many have a negative attitude toward learning mathematics. Additionally, gender and scholarship status are not differential factors. Gamification proved to be a useful pedagogical strategy to promote participation and enhance motivation among undergraduate students, particularly in a context of academic confinement.

The literature provides principles guiding the design of such programs, which were considered for an instruction intended to strengthen the teacher’s practice in relation to the development of mathematical skills. The objective of this work was to study if the designed program was effective, in relation to the impact on the teacher’s teaching. A case study on a group of in-service teachers focused on the ability of mathematical modeling (MM) and their perspectives of this skill was carried out. This was divided into three moments: before, during, and after the program. The findings show that, before the program, teachers conceived modeling from epistemological, pragmatic and conceptual perspectives; during the program, they focused on the pragmatic and educational perspectives; and at the end of the program, the group was stripped of the pragmatic, epistemological and conceptual perspectives to move towards the educational and socio-critical. They were also able to justify the choice or disassociation of one or more of them.

Different theoretical frameworks and assessment instruments have emerged for measuring this skill. However, more applied studies on its implementation and evaluation in real-life educational settings are required. In this sense, pre-post experimental designs are essential for identifying new methods for developing collaborative problem-solving skills. To do so, equivalent tests are needed to facilitate consistent score interpretations and reduce the practice effect. In the present study, a Design-Based Research approach is used to design and validate an assessment tool with two equivalent forms based on a framework proposed by the OECD and applied to a collaborative activity. A total of 719 students aged between 10 and 13 years old participated in the different stages of the study. The results show that the proposed instrument effectively measures the problem-solving dimension of collaborative problem-solving skills among students of this age. Moreover, the results from the test were equivalent for both forms and across genders. Finally, there were no significant differences when assessing collaborative problem-solving in human-human groups versus human-agent groups using the proposed instrument. For future work, we recommend including other data sources than just text-based conversations. This would allow us to capture the rich social interactions present in this type of activity. Future work should also consider exploring the extent to which skills could be trained. This could be done in an experimental design assessed using the equivalent forms of the proposed instrument as a pre- and post-test. Doing so would provide a more accurate measure of students’ collaborative skills. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment; Collaborative problem solving; Design-based research; PISA 2015; Validation","Design of experiments; Statistics; Assessment; Assessment instruments; Collaborative problem solving; Design-based research; Elementary schools; PISA 2015; Problem solving skills; School students; Theoretical framework; Validation; Students","Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT: 1180024; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico, FONDECYT","This work was supported by FONDECYT/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1180024 ].",,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114676711

To further improve the experience, Akasha uses information about users to adjust the difficulty level, and to customize the look and feel of the application. To validate the approach, this study assessed student performance before and after using Akasha in three different schools (public and private) of Bogotá (Colombia). The results suggest that the use of Akasha may have a positive impact on students’ learning, regardless of their social, economic, or technological background. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Education; Geometry; Ludic activities; Personalization","Geometry; Students; Colombia; Elementary geometry; Elementary schools; International students; Software applications; Student performance; Application programs",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100676022

Rarely before has any other period moved the human spirit into such discipline or submission— depending on one’s personal and emotional points of view. Both extremes have been widely influenced by external factors on each individual’s life path. Education in the sciences and engineering has encountered more issues than other disciplines due to specialized mathematical handwriting, experimental demonstrations, abstract complexity, and lab practices. This work analyses three aspects of science education courses taught by university professors in a collaborative teacher cluster, sharing technology applications and education methodologies in science over three semesters when the COVID-19 lockdown was in effect. The first aspect was a didactic design coming from several educational frameworks through adoption or sharing. The second one was an analysis by discipline of multiple factors affecting student engagement during the health contingency. The third analysis examined the gains and losses in our students caused by the university closure and the pandemic’s intrusions. The report explores the correlations of the exiting student perceptions with their academic performance in the courses and survey results about the impact of decisions or happenings during the crisis.

From a quantitative approach, we ask from the mathematical thinking styles (MTS) theory about the correlations between preferences of certain MTS and mathematical performance. For this, a valid test instrument and a sample of 275 16-year-old Chilean students were used to gain insight into their preferences, beliefs and emotions when solving mathematical tasks and when learning mathematics. The results show, among other things, a clear positive correlation between mathematical performance and analytical thinking style, and also evidence the correlation between self-efficacy, analytical thinking and grades. It is concluded that students who prefer the analytical style are more advantageous in school, since the evaluation processes have a higher valuation of analytic mathematical thinking. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: We conducted a nested cross-sectional and mixed-methods study in a sample of 81 third-year medical students. Two face-to-face interventions were designed and conducted to offer tools to improve study habits, time management, and prioritizing skills. A nine-item structured questionnaire was administered. Descriptive statistics was performed for the quantitative section and thematic analysis for the qualitative section. Results: Of the study population, 74.1% (60/81) completed the online questionnaire, 65.4% were female, and the mean age of the sample was 21.4±1.2 years old. Overall, ~50% of participants affirmed that the workshops were useful to improve time management, organize tasks and adapt to the new study modality imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 60% of the students found the application of the provided tools during the interventions (SMART and COMPASS) useful to determine personal values and set a proper mindset for coping with distance learning. Further, 93.3% of the respondents applied the SMART strategy learned to set goals at least once during the confinement time. These findings were also seen in the thematic analysis. Conclusions: Overall, most of the students found the workshops useful and were able to practice what they had learned during this pandemic lockdown.

This research aims to describe the beliefs held by 76 pre-service teachers and 19 teacher educators from four Costa Rican public universities, using the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) questionnaire. The results suggest that both pre-service teachers and teacher educators believe in a constructivist orientation focused on the learner. Both groups support the view of mathematics as a process of inquiry and active learning and agree that mathematical skills are not fixed or associated with gender or culture. In the literature, the beliefs manifested by the participants are associated with positive results regarding student outcomes and teaching practices.

First, we scaffold geometry outcomes to take students progressively from basic geometric shapes to a stronger understanding of complex three-dimensional (3D) properties. Second, we use gamification to introduce fun into the learning process. Third, we propose digital activities in virtual environments, with which students can, in particular, develop 3D spatial perception. Concretely, children are immersed in a two-dimensional (2D)–3D world in which they play the role of architects who manipulate 2D and 3D shapes to create buildings.

Moreover, this approach is still in constant evolution and, therefore, diverse issues and challenges related to geographical, temporal, and sociocultural distances are also present. Therefore, many universities around the world are increasing their efforts in creating programs to prepare more skilled graduates to work in globally distributed environments. However, providing GSD courses among universities distributed in different locations is not so profitable and normally involves a high number of collaborations among various teachers and students that traditional teaching approaches cannot support. In this study, the Cadxela tool is presented to enable undergraduate students to acquire practical experience in GSD and improve their communication and teamwork skills. An empirical evaluation was conducted on Cadxela involving students and teachers from five universities in Mexico, Spain, Chile, Cuba, and Peru. The participants developed a total of 15 projects to experience different problems related to geographical, temporal, and sociocultural distances. The obtained results from pre and post-evaluations showed that Cadxela can contribute to facilitating the development of practical projects on GSD undergraduate courses, while students develop their knowledge, social skills associated with this topic as well as teamwork and communication skills. Finally, the data collected on the teachers' perceptions suggested that Cadxela can also be a useful tool for introducing the GSD approach at the undergraduate level. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","global software development; project-based learning; soft skills; undergraduate level","Curricula; Software design; Teaching; Communication skills; Educational tools; Global software development; Global software engineering; Project based learning; Soft skills; Software engineering education; Teachers'; Teamwork skills; Undergraduate level; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120973854

As a result, record numbers of students are not attending University due to temporary closures mandated by governments in an attempt to reduce the number of cases. The COVID-19 outbreak has created challenges for academics and students in the process of adapting to online teaching and learning. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of bioscience academics during the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020. Design and methods: Perspectives from academics across eight countries (Brazil, Georgia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, UK and USA) were included giving a global insight into the phenomena. A descriptive multiple case study approach was used with each academic in their context as the case. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse data, which enabled themes to emerge. Results and Conclusions: Three major themes emerged from the experiences of the participants: (1) teaching methods, (2) emotions, and (3) support networks. Our results suggest there have been both benefits and challenges to the change in teaching methods and this is reflected in similarities across the case studies. One key finding was that both students and staff need to be better trained to use online platforms, and adequate peer support and technical support must be given to improve program effectiveness. The results of this study have contributed new information on teaching and learning throughout the pandemic and can be used as a platform for further research and also as a reflection for those making high-level decisions in policy in education in these interesting times. © 2021 The Author(s).

Sixteen children were engaged in 19 PD sessions to develop tangibles and auditory stimuli to represent numbers, and to explore activities to use through a tangible user interface. We describe the context and lessons learned along the PD process with children and educators, and their implications on the design. Two main outputs were derived: iCETA, a multimodal tangible user interface that allows the use of tangible blocks to represent numbers; and, Logarín, an audiogame designed for iCETA that enables mathematical training. We explored the use of iCETA and Logarín during 15 sessions with 11 children with visual impairments. Results indicate that playing Logarín is engaging and capable of promoting their mathematical abilities.

We identified common aspects between each representation and its referent, as well as between different representations of the same referent, but without redundancies between characteristics that each of them present. Furthermore, it was evidenced that it is through external representations that indications of mental representations are manifested. It was also identified that learning is related to the coordination of representations, which is based on previously constructed knowledge and which involves the declarative domain on the part of the learner, as well as progressive access to awareness of their own learning, which is mediated by representations. The convergences identified provide teachers and researchers with information and possibilities for reflections about the learnings built by students and the fundamental role of various representations so that they can perform procedures and discourses, which contributes to the elaboration of evaluative proposals, didactic and methodological approached conceptual learning explicitly and consciously. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Children with reading learning disability (RLD) show a specific deficit in learning to read, along with motor, rhythmic and visual difficulties. The present exploratory research aims to observe the effects of a virtual reality game training program on reading performance (accuracy, speed, and comprehension), visual attention, motor balance, and coordination in children with RLD in an experimental study by comparing two groups (experimental and control) of children. The game was developed by the authors and incorporates a commercial game “BeatSaber” and a specific design game “GrafoTami”. The results showed that the training program induced a significant effect on visual attention task scores and movement speed in two balance tasks for participants in the experimental group, while participants in the control group did not show any changes. Although no significant changes in reading performance were observed, the high magnitude effect size suggested that changes in reading performance would likely become significant with a larger number of participants, and the same was true for physical self-perception and happiness self-perception, which are areas of self-perception. © 2021","Attention; Balance; Gaming; Learning disability; Reading; Training; Virtual reality",,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","The main objective of this research was to explore the effects of virtual reality game training on individuals’ reading abilities, visuospatial attention, self-perception, balance, and motor coordination.

To modify the conceptions that these students have about teaching and learning, the course was taught using different active learning instructional strategies, making at the same time students explicitly aware of their names, objectives, and main characteristics. Degree of knowledge and value of specific active learning activities by these students were measured with three opinion surveys answered by students at the same time they took the three written exams necessary to pass the course. Learning of physics principles was monitored by pre and post instruction application of a general physics multiple-choice test. Results indicate that these students were not only able to identify all teaching strategies but that they value them very highly, with more than 80% of the answers distributed in the two highest rating categories. Opinion and value of the small group work were also very high, increasing with time along the course. When asked to sketch a plan to teach 11th-grade students a physics topic covered in that part of the course, almost all participants proposed to use active learning activities as well as different information and communication technologies. It was also found that conceptual learning of the physics subjects covered in this course was quite satisfactory with high normalized gains, characteristics of active learning instruction. Further work is suggested to confirm these results with appropriate experiments. © 2021 Association for Science Teacher Education.","active learning; conceptual knowledge; general physics; Pedagogical content knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106668935

Thereby, we are interested in knowing which methodological alternative can allow the learning of chemistry from the visualization resources of three-dimensional molecules. This research aimed to investigate the effects of pedagogical resources, such as alternative and virtual physical molecular models (augmented reality), on the learning of molecular geometry. This qualitative and experimental investigation was carried out to support the planning, elaboration, implementation and analysis of a didactic sequence based on neurocognitive principles associated with ""memory"". A didactic intervention was designed for three moments, with an interval of fifteen days between one session and another. Nine volunteer students aged 16-17 years participated in the activities. They are from the 2nd year of high school from a private school in the state of Sergipe. The results revealed that: 1) Physical and virtual resources can favour the learning of the molecular geometry and can serve as techniques for assessing students' errors; 2) Methodological procedures that consider brain functioning and the use of sense organs facilitate the consolidation and evocation of long-term memory. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Is there a difference if average grades and the number of failed subjects, factored as benchmarks of academic achievement, are considered? Do the measured attributions have any weight when predicting students’ grades? A Likert scale measuring eight different attributions of academic achievement was applied to 165 students. The results showed that the most important attribution for academic achievement was intelligence. Sex-related differences were found in two attributes: calm and effort. In general, students with four failed subjects were those with the lowest averages measured in attributions. The variables that predicted good grades for male students were effort and good teachers, for female students, a liking for teachers, luck, and attention. © 2021, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

Thus, for the present work, a teaching methodological proposal was developed, aiming at an interdisciplinary work in the approach of Mathematics and Physics concepts, and, from this, a pedagogical imagination exercise was triggered. This exercise aimed to identify possibilities and potentialities in relation to the contents and concepts to be explored in solving the problem described in the proposal and counted on the participation of teachers from the two disciplines involved in high school. Interactive virtual learning objects (OVA) were developed, using the GeoGebra software, in order to provide geometric and algebraic visualization of properties related to the proposed problem situation. The data collected during the research were subjected to a discourse analysis in which new possibilities of content and concepts to be worked out from the application of the proposal were evidenced. The results indicate that the use of problem situations with interdisciplinary relations and OVA are favorable characteristics for obtaining satisfactory results in teaching practice, and the pedagogical imagination exercise with teachers brought contributions to their continuing education, and to their interaction with the technological resources available, with a view to being used in your classes. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Unfortunately, the literature tends to neglect the focus question role, and the identification of superficial conceptual maps, even if conceptually correct, does not happen. In this paper, an analysis of clusters was carried out based on the performance of students in a questionnaire containing items related to the themes of scientific thought, classical astronomy, and modern astronomy to group students according to their levels of conceptual understanding. The performance of students in each group was used to discuss the features of the CMs built during an assessment task in a Higher Education course. The CMs were analyzed based on the semantic clarity and conceptual correction of the propositions and the appropriateness of the content to address the focus question. The students who best represented their conceptual schema, built maps with a large number of appropriate propositions, and answered in a larger proportion to the focus question, were also those who obtained the best performances in the questionnaire. From the results, it is possible to conclude that the reading of the semantic content of the CMs reveals the students' conceptual understanding.

Typically, these digital control concepts and algorithms are implemented in high-resources microcontrollers; nevertheless, we show that they can also be implemented in low-resource devices, helping students to acquire fundamental knowledge and develop long-term skills to solve real problems from the learning they achieve in their undergraduate educational programs in control or computer engineering. For this purpose, we provide an algorithm to synthesize a digital proportional-derivative controller oriented to low-resource microcontrollers (microcontrollers without floating-point unit). This algorithm allows implementing solutions for classic controllers in low-resource microcontrollers applied to academic and technological fields. This algorithm reduces the excessive amount of execution time in a low-resource microcontroller, it works with integer numbers and it is designed to implement fast classical controllers, which typically are performed with floating-point operations. Furthermore, we present a brief description of the implemented electronic circuit, serving as a guide for students to develop their own circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can be successfully applied to an electromagnetic levitation system, which is commonly used in the academic training of electronics and control engineers, mainly due to its unstable nature. In this case, although the levitation system has a small time constant, the proposed algorithm appropriately leads the system to a stable regime. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","control engineering; control systems; electromagnetic levitation system; experimental learning; PD algorithm","Digital arithmetic; Digital control systems; Digital devices; Electromagnetic propulsion; Microcontrollers; Personnel training; Students; Classical controllers; Computer engineering; Electromagnetic levitation system; Floating point operations; Floating point units; Industrial environments; Proportional-derivative controllers; Small time constants; Controllers","Instituto Politécnico Nacional, IPN: SIP 20201156, SIP–20200445; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: CB‐2016‐01/284372","Jose A.

Depending on which part is needed to recover, the denser product or the pure liquid, we use the term thickening or clarification to define these operations. Thickener design is compulsory for chemical engineering (CE) curricula and is usually introduced in courses related to unit operations. Thickening design problems are solved by geometric methods (e.g., Coe–Clevenger or Kynch–Roberts methods). However, nowadays, computers play a more and more important role in CE practice. Both specific and general software solutions are essential. Whereas CE-specific software is adequate for graduates and professionals, general mathematical software can also be used in class. They can help to deliver certain competences included in the vast majority of CE curricula. For CE introductory courses, software with integrated functions and friendly interfaces are generally preferred over those that require to be familiarized with programming languages. Here, we describe the use of SMath Studio in 2nd-year engineering courses by nonfamiliarized students. SMath Studio is a comprehensive mathematical notebook, similar to Mathcad, but it is entirely free for personal or commercial use. In this study, student's opinion was surveyed. Around 70 students took part in the two-phase survey. The use of SMath allowed students to better understand the theoretical basis, fostered critical thinking, and increased their motivation to apply this software for solving other engineering problems. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","freeware; graphical methods; thickeners; unit operations","Clarification; Problem oriented languages; Students; Studios; Surveys; Engineering course; Engineering problems; Freeware softwares; Integrated function; Introductory course; Mathematical software; Software solution; Thickener designs; Curricula","Universidad de Concepción, UdeC: 17‐003","This study was supported by the University of Concepción (Innovative Teaching Project grant number 17‐003).

In this sense, we are interested in understanding how the field of science and mathematics education is incorporating the ideas of the author. This work aimed to map research in science and mathematics education that develops Michel Foucault's concepts and describe how the author's work has been used in the area. We focused our research on the best-ranked Brazilian journals which address Teaching (strata A1 and A2), according to the Qualis system (organized by the Brazilian agency Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES). We selected 26 journals which focus on science and mathematics education (n=17) or in education as a whole (n=9). We analyzed all articles published between 1990 and 2016 and selected the ones which cited the work of Michel Foucault at least once and classified them into three categories (incidental, conceptual or working mode appropriation) according with how the authors approached the work of the philosopher. We first analyzed the data of the 238 articles categorized as having appropriated the Foucauldian ""working mode"". Then, we selected through keywords 18 texts to investigate deeper how the work of Foucault has been incorporated in the field of science and mathematics education. We found that his work has spread on researches in the field, which started to operate the Foucauldian ""working mode"", especially since the 2000s. The theoretical and methodological appropriation of Foucault frameworks in the analyzed articles is related to the procedures of discourse analysis, however we detected a limitation in the use of empirical sources. The authors usually use the work of Foucault as a methodological tool and to do second-order critics, investing in the ideas and practices already consolidated in the field. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Several aspects are addressed, covering CAD (Computer-Aided Design) modelling systems to CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) solutions, in terms of analysis and validation of mechanical resistance calculations. Therefore, structural mechanics fundamental concepts and mechanics of materials are also addressed. Particular focus is given on the development of curricula components related to Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing. Doing so, three-dimensional structural modelling is applied to study the behaviour in selected simple case-studies where an external load is applied and the corresponding deflections are evaluated. Then, analytical and numerical analyses are performed and compared. During classes, patent aversion to solve analytical problems was clearly observed on the part of the students once calculus knowledge was required. The typical trend in engineering students, skipping the manual analytical methodology to solve a problem in order to go straight to numerical simulations via commercial Finite Element (FE) codes, was observed. The main focus of this work is, therefore, to determine the pedagogical effects of allying the analytical procedures and virtual simulators. It was possible to confirm the beneficial aspects of such methodology, considering that the regular engineering student has already a scientific basis on calculus and analytical process. Such knowledge will support mechanical project decisions, from model development to the analysis, and a sounding background to perform criticism of the results provided by the software. © 2020 by the authors.

The methodology used was drawn on considerations of a socio-formal approach to the learner. The analysis was made on the basis of students' written and spoken discourse during the classroom. Results indicate that, in responding to dilemmas, students manage to manipulate the concept of piecewise function not only in terms of its mathematical meaning, but also of its moral value.

The aim of this short report is to describe individual training load, recovery and injuries in elite group rhythmic gymnasts during competitive periods. Six gymnasts from the Brazilian senior rhythmic gymnastics group were monitored daily over a 126-day period comprising regular training and four competitions. Training load was measured using the session rating of perceived exertion (session-RPE). Daily load, chronic load, and acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) were assessed. The Total Quality Recovery (TQR) scale was used to monitor recovery and a 3-day rolling average (3RA) TQR was also measured. Injuries were diagnosed and reported by the medical staff and their reports were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics were used. The gymnasts presented distinct daily load, ACWR, and recovery patterns, as well as injuries across the competitive periods. All athletes had rapid increase (“spike”) in load. Three athletes were underrecovered more than 60% of the time. Four athletes sustained five injuries during the time of the study (all lower limb overuse injuries, two severe, two mild and one slight). Individual factors such as age and chronic load could moderate how each gymnast responds to training and tolerates spikes in load. Moreover, injuries sustained during competitive periods appear to affect the short and long-term careers of gymnasts, as well as impair training and competition organization of the team. © 2020, University of Ljubljana.

This research aimed to analyze the didactic transposition on the expression of skin color, eye color, and human height on Brazilian and Portuguese textbooks and the ""São Paulo Student Notebook"". Of the biology textbooks for several periods of secondary education (Brazilian ""Ensino Médio"" and Portuguese ""Ensino Secundário""), twelve recent ones were analyzed in detail: nine Brazilian collections and three Portuguese collections. The content of these textbooks was compared with the contents of the reference literature in the genetics area. In this study, reference literature includes some recent scientific papers and academic books for teacher training. The influence of knowledge, values, and social practices on this process of didactic transposition was also a matter of analysis. Results showed that most textbooks are close to the scientific literature in discussing the polygenic determination of the characteristics analyzed. About half of the analyzed books mentioned the influence of the environment. Values and practices influencing didactic transposition of these topics were also identified, such as 1) concerns about avoiding a deterministic view of genetics; 2) the practice of mathematizing biology; 3) the authors' practices in following curriculum guidelines; 4) practices and concerns related to textbook evaluation; and 5) concerns with avoiding bias within populations composed of different ethnic groups. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Instituto de Fisica.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents the traditional method commonly used in computer graphic stereoscopic vision (implemented in C language) and the proposed method (implemented in GeoGebra software). The proposed method is a new methodology for stereo spatial visualization. It uses the orthogonal axonometric perspective obtained from the mongean projections of the object, both concepts studied in Descriptive Geometry course. Findings – The use of stereoscopic techniques has great potential for the improvement of spatial visualization ability, because they allow the understanding of spatial situations presented in complex exercises. The students who tested the proposed method said that it offered a superior stereo vision depth in relation to the traditional matrix method. Research limitations/implications – For future work, the paper suggests to carry out a statistical study to evaluate the educational benefit of the tool, and to investigate the proposed method using the conical axonometric perspective. Practical implications – Create a virtual environment to support the process of teaching/learning Descriptive Geometry and contribute to the development of students' spatial visualization skills. The software will be available on the Internet, in the GeoGebra libraries. The objective is to increase e-learning, where a greater number of students will study. Social implications – The current goal in Brazil universities is to greatly increase the number of poor students entering as a social inclusion strategy. University courses need more efficient teaching techniques to attend the students, so the e-learning techniques are recommended. Originality/value – This paper’s innovative characteristic comes from the implementation of stereoscopic vision from traditional methods used in Descriptive Geometry, so the proposed method improves both the visualization ability and the Descriptive Geometry basic concepts, which points out to its educational role. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Computer software; E-Learning; Mathematics; Research; Students; Undergraduates",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942013939

To overcome this misconcept it is proposed that in the Chemistry courses addressing the properties of metals, the Band Orbitals are named according to the terminology of the Molecular Orbital Theo-r y, such as: «Band-bonding Orbitals», (OBb), for the subgroup of lower energy orbitals, and «Band-antibonding Orbitals» (OB *), for the one with most energy. This research was developed in two stages: the first, instruments design and exploration, from 2007 to 2009, and the second, confirmation of results, in 2010. The results indicate that: a) the students applied the deduction of metal bond strength correctly, b) highly significant statistical association evidence exists between the terminology used and the responses; being highly significant the proportion of correct answers in the group that used the Molecular Orbital Theory terminology.","Band theory; Bonding-antibonding orbital; Electrical conductivity of metals; Metals; Molecular orbital theory",,,,,,,,,,,,,"English; Spanish",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906684361

It is desirable for students to program the routines and algorithms by themselves but this is not always feasible, particularly during short courses and workshops in which the interest is to understand the information supplied by several analytical methods. Considering the time constraints and the need to stress the interpretative rather than the computational skills, the authors have developed the software package UATSA (University of Arizona Time Series Analysis) that incorporates many analytical tools commonly used in time series analysis in an organized and sequential manner: exploratory statistics, markovian processes, univariate and multivariate analyses (ARMA models), frequency decomposition algorithms, principal components, canonical correlations and cluster analyses are included within the current version of the package. UATSA is a stand-alone executable file compiled in MATLAB ® that has been used in courses of time series analysis in hydrology at the University of Arizona and in several workshops offered by the authors between 2004 and 2007. The software aims to easily illustrate the use of algorithms in the synthesis and decomposition of time series, providing a background to the methods and a visual platform that is user friendly and data extensive. The software has evolved through the years, incorporating suggestions made by students to improve its appearance and widen its scope.

This educational article addresses two alternative computational procedures of approximate nature for solving this modified Bessel equation: (a) the Frobenius method, and (b) the power series method coupled with a curve fit. Approximate temperature distributions of good quality have been obtained with available symbolic algebra software such as Maple or Mathematica on a personal computer. The primary specification when designing annular fins of uniform thickness is the amount of heat transfer from a tube to the surrounding fluid. These calculations are traditionally done with the help of a fin efficiency diagram. The fin efficiencies can be computed approximately by integration or by differentiation via the Frobenius and power series methods as well. Students of heat transfer courses can benefit from these two alternative computational procedures that seek to circumvent the use and operations with Bessel functions and still produce approximate analytic results of good caliber. A course on ordinary differential equations is the only mathematical background that students need to have to implement these computational techniques. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Annular fins; Frobenius method; Power series method","Computer software; Curve fitting; Differential equations; Engineering education; Heat transfer; Numerical methods; Temperature distribution; Thermoanalysis; Tubes (components); Annular fins; Frobenius method; Modified Bessel equation; Power series method; Fins (heat exchange)",,,,,,,,,,,,"English",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031674407
