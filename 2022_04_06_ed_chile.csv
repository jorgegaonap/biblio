The model is research based as it considered a literature review for adequate selection and design of activities consistent with the levels of students' reasoning skills. The level of scientific reasoning is positively correlated to student success. By contrast to a control group of students following traditional lectures, we observed a significant reduction in failure rate for students that do not yet possess formal scientific reasoning. This profile of students being the majority, we conclude that implementing active learning is particularly suited to the first year of higher education in the context of a developing country. It fits the particularities of student profile and typical classroom size, leading to learning improvement and reduction of academic risk, as well as being financially sound.","[Lagubeau, Guillaume; Tecpan, Silvia; Hernandez, Carla] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile",,"Lagubeau, G (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, Santiago 9170124, Region Metropol, Chile.",guillaume.lagubeau@usach.cl; silvia.tecpan@usach.cl; carla.hernandez.s@usach.cl,"Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/I-9567-2018","Tecpan-Flores, Silvia/0000-0001-9343-6863; Hernandez-Silva, Carla/0000-0003-2974-4989",CONICYT through Proyecto Fondecyt de Iniciacion [11170580]; Proyecto DICYT USACH [031931TF],"We thank Vicerrectoria Academica USACH through Convenio Marco CM USA1856, and the Engineering Faculty of USACH.

Limited evidence exists regarding their effectiveness in improving academic performance among medical students. This study aims to assess whether a smartphone application could improve academic performance in multiple-choice tests. Methods: A double-masked randomised trial was held among interns at the School of Medicine of the Universidad de Valparaiso. Participants were randomised to receive an application designed to review key concepts in Internal Medicine and its subspecialties using clinical vignettes. Contents were selected and provided in a format akin to a mandatory national examination required for practising medicine in Chile. Analyses were undertaken under the intention to treat principle and missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques. Results: Eighty interns volunteered to participate in this trial, most were female (48 students, 60%) and had a mean age of 25.3 +/- 2.2 years. Participants showed significant experience with smartphones, with a median use of 4 years (IQR 3-6 years) and 67 (83.7%) reporting routine use in clinical practice. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant improvements in performance amongst students allocated to the smartphone application (mean increase of 14.5 +/- 8.9 vs 9.4 +/- 11.6points, p = 0.03). A reduction in total time and mean time per question was also found, which was significant in complete-case analyses (p = 0.04). Discussion: Smartphones were popular among medical trainees. Academic performance was significantly improved by the use of our application, although the overall effect was smaller than expected from previous trials. This study provides evidence that smartphone-based interventions can assist in teaching internal medicine.","[Martinez, Felipe] Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile; [Martinez, Felipe] Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Tobar, Catalina] Hosp Gustavo Fricke, Dept Med Interna, Alvares 1532, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Taramasco, Carla] Univ Valparaiso, Lab Informac & Tecnol, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso 222, Chile",,"Martinez, F (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Escuela Med, Dept Salud Publ, Valparaiso 2664, Chile.; Martinez, F (corresponding author), Clin Ciudad del Mar, Area Invest & Estudios Clin, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",felipe.martinez@uv.cl,"Martinez, Felipe/ABF-5868-2021","Martinez, Felipe/0000-0002-9857-8403",,,,17,9,9,0,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6920,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

Yet we lack a complete understanding of how different instructional strategies impact the relationship between cooperation and learning. In this paper we present results from a field experiment with 82 first-year students in an introductory physics course showing how different instructional strategies led to different social configurations in the classroom and to differences in individual academic performance. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively sought out information from multiple peers were less likely to perform well on well-structured problems as compared to those who did not seek help, whereas, for ill-structured (real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the learning environment. We observed that good performance on ill- and well-structured problems was sensitive to different social network configurations. In a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students performed better on well-structured problems than ill-structured problems. By contrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access to more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems promoted creative thinking, provided that instructors guided the problem-solving process and motivated students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems entailed. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional strategies play an important role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing cooperative learning methods have to accompany them with adequate instructional strategy.","[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Northwestern Univ, Northwestern Inst Complex Syst NICO, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Candia, Cristian] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Ctr Invest Complejidad Social CICS, Las Condes 7550000, Chile; [Leonardi, Paul M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Coll Engn, Technol & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.",jpulgar@ubiobio.cl; cristian.candia@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Candia Vallejos, Cristian/0000-0002-9654-543X",AAPT E.

However, due to their constrained nature, these problems hinder collaboration and idea generation. In order to encourage student collaboration and decision making demands among undergraduate students in an introductory physics course, we utilized a real-world problem where groups were asked to compose a well-structured physics problem for younger learners. In this study we explored how they collaborated in composing physics problems. Data collection consisted of audio recording of the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their physics problems and their respective problem solutions. Through interviews, we accessed participants' perceptions of the task and related challenges. Results suggest that composing problems is an opportunity for participants to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details, and magnitudes and units to introduce in their activities. Further, participants valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced by them with traditional well-structured problems. These findings shed light on the nature of composing physics problems in undergraduate courses, where participants assume a different role by facing a real-world activity that encourages expertise through physics-related communication and writing.","[Pulgar, Javier] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile; [Fahler, Valentina; Spina, Alexis] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Gevirtz Grad Sch Educ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Pulgar, J (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Fis, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion 4051381, Chile.",jpulgar@ubiobio.cl,,"Pulgar, Javier/0000-0003-0325-7306; Fahler, Valentina/0000-0002-9883-9052; Spina, Alexis/0000-0002-9219-7888",AAPT E.

The study consisted of two phases starting with designing a computational chemistry based learning environment followed by a case study where students' perceptions towards educational computational chemistry were explored. First, we designed an authentic research-based chemistry learning module that supported problem-based learning through the utilisation of computational chemistry methods suitable for pre-service chemistry education. The objective of the learning module was to promote learning of specific chemistry knowledge and development of scientific skills. Systematic design decisions were made through the TPASK framework. The learning module was designed for a third-year physical chemistry course taken by pre-service chemistry teachers in Chile. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in a course, and students' perceptions were gathered using semi-structured group interviews. The sample consisted of 22 pre-service chemistry teachers. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis using the same TPASK framework employed in the learning module design. Based on our findings, pre-service chemistry teachers first acquired Technological Scientific Knowledge (TSK) and then developed some elements of their TPASK. Besides, they highly appreciated the combination of student-centred problem-based learning and the use of computational chemistry tools. Students felt the educational computational learning environment supported their own knowledge acquisition and expressed an interest in applying similar learning environments in their future teaching careers. This case study demonstrates that learning through authentic real-world problems using educational computational methods offers great potential in supporting pre-service teachers' instruction in the science of chemistry and pedagogy. For further research in the TPASK framework, we propose there would be significant benefit from developing new learning environments of this nature and evaluating their utility in pre-service and in-service chemistry teacher's education.","[Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Bahamonde Padilla, Victor] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile; [Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Druker, Sofia] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Diaz, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Dept Educ Diferencial, Santiago, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, AI Virtasen Aukio 1,POB 55, Helsinki 00014, Finland",,"Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Ciencias Basics, Dept Quim, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PahchemLab, Santiago, Chile.; Rodriguez-Becerra, J (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, UMCE, Programa Doctorado Educ, Santiago, Chile.",jorge.rodriguez@umce.cl,"BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017; C‡ceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021","BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; C‡ceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X; Druker, Sofia/0000-0002-0934-4825","DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [FGI 46-18]; Doctorate in Education Program - UMCE, Chile [PIPedI20164]; Programa Extraordinario de Becas de Postgrado - Doctorado en Educacion - UMCE","This research was supported by the FGI 46-18 project (DIUMCE, Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile).

We used a quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-tests to investigate the impact of teaching evolution with and without NOS in two classes with 15-16-year-old students, who were randomly assigned to these two classes. To measure their understanding of NOS and their acceptance and understanding of evolution, we used three different instruments that have been shown to generate reliable and valid inferences in comparable populations. The main results of this study were that, in the class in which the teaching of evolution included NOS instruction, the students' understanding of NOS and their acceptance of evolution significantly improved. However, irrespective of the use of NOS instruction, both classes increased their understanding of evolution. These results support the claim that NOS instruction may influence students' acceptance of evolution but not their understanding of evolution and natural selection.","[Cofre, Hernan L.; Carmona, Francisca; Navarrete, Kasandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Santibanez, David P.] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Santibanez, David P.; Jimenez, Juan P.] IIT, Math & Sci Educ Dept, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Spotorno, Angel] Univ Chile, Fac Med Norte, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Claudia A.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile",,"Cofre, HL (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@pucv.cl,,", hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457",Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1131029],This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT) [grant number 1131029].,,64,14,14,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-9266,2157-6009,,J BIOL EDUC,J.

Academic language might be one of the factors influencing the quality of written texts, given that prior research has shown its impact on reading comprehension. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of Spanish Core Academic Language Skills (S-CALS) and academic vocabulary to the quality of written argumentation and explanation. For this study, 126 Chilean 8th grade students produced an argumentative text and an explanatory text about the same topic. In addition, their academic vocabulary was assessed with the S-AVoc-T test and their CALS with the S-CALS-I test. Results show that both CALS and academic vocabulary are significantly and positively correlated with both writing tasks. Even though these instruments make different contributions to the predictive models in each discursive genre, a Principal Component Analysis revealed that the model that best explains writing quality are those which combine both language variables, namely Spanish Core Academic Language and Vocabulary Skills (S-CALVS). In argumentation, the S-CALVS model explains 29% of the variance, after controlling by gender. In contrast, in explanation, S-CALVS explains 35% of the variance. It is concluded that it is relevant to develop situated writing in each discursive genre and, upon that basis, to work with both CALS and academic vocabulary, because they have a specific impact on academic texts writing.","[Figueroa, Javiera; Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Figueroa, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.",jfigueroami@uc.cl,"Chandia, Eugenio/ABH-9041-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017; Figueroa, Javiera/H-8181-2017","Chandia, Eugenio/0000-0003-2489-1226; Figueroa, Javiera/0000-0003-1677-3932","FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150238]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate [21130191]; Doctoral Program in Education, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","This study was conducted as part of FONDECYT REGULAR Project number 1150238, funded by CONICYT, Chile, and a CONICYT-PCHA/National Doctorate/21130191 scholarship.

The tested model confirms the expected results but notes that self-efficacy does not show a significant direct effect on performance. Therefore, a second model is tested. We include self-efficacy as a predictor of academic engagement, eliminating the direct effect of this variable on performance. The results show a greater adjustment in the second model. It is concluded that: (a) positive emotions and autonomy support predict academic performance, self-efficacy and academic engagement; (b) self-efficacy predicts higher levels of academic engagement and the latter improves academic performance, and (c) indirect effects also show the existence of a mediation of these variables on the predictive relationship of autonomy support and positive emotions on performance.

Even less addressed it within the Chilean educational system. The specific objective of this study was to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of the vocabulary produced by Chilean 4th grade students. Based on a national writing survey, a sample of 2056 texts written by 685 students was collected (narrative, persuasive, and informative texts). Current literature defines lexical quality as a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. To represent the properties of the vocabulary, a set of indicators were selected: (a) lexical diversity; (b) lexical sophistication; and (c) lexical density. Using multilevel modeling (students and schools as levels 1 and 2) to explain a global writing score we found that diversity was a significant determinant for narrative and persuasive texts, density was a significant determinant for the three genres and sophistication was a significant determinant for narrative and expository text. In addition, indicators related to gender and socioeconomic conditions were only significant determinants of narrative stories. The parts of speech most often used also varied according to the purpose of each text. In all genres, words had a short extension and were very sensitive to the input presented in the stimuli. These results imply a significant challenge to this education system: how to promote the development of vocabulary in all children in order to support language learning.","[Gomez Vera, Gabriela; Sotomayor, Carmen; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bedwell, Percy; Maria Dominguez, Ana] Arauco Fdn, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez Vera, Gabriela] Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Vera, GG (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Vera, GG (corresponding author), Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",gabriela.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Gomez Vera, Gabriela/0000-0002-6842-3953",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy [79112008],Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003 and CONICYT Project of Insertion of Advanced Human Capital in the Academy No. 79112008 are gratefully acknowledged.,,41,6,7,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-4777,1573-0905,,READ WRIT,Read.

However, the cognitive and linguistic skills that underlie online inference making remain elusive. The authors aimed to clarify the effects of vocabulary and text comprehension on word-to-text integration during reading. In a self-paced reading study, the authors measured participants' integration of words across sentence boundaries by comparing reading times at a critical word and the subsequent region, when preceded by the same critical word (repetition condition), by a lexically associated word (association condition), or by a word with no direct lexical link (inference condition). Furthermore, the authors assessed vocabulary knowledge, text comprehension, working memory, decoding, and fluid intelligence in the sample. Results showed that richer vocabulary was associated with immediate integration, as evidenced by reading time differences between the critical word and the subsequent word in the inference condition. Other individual differences did not predict self-paced reading times. Findings suggest that lexical knowledge plays a stronger role relative to other individual skills in online inference making and contributes to refining understanding of the mechanisms that underlie efficient reading.","[Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guerra, Ernesto] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Kronmueller, Edmundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guerra, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile.",ernesto.guerra@ciae.uchile.cl; ekr@uc.cl,,"Guerra, Ernesto/0000-0001-7403-5271","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT [11171074]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]","This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT; National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Government of Chile) under grant FONDECYT No 11171074 to Ernesto Guerra.

Methods: Through an iterative process, an international group of 15 experts developed an initial set of learning outcomes following a review and discussion of relevant international and local literature. A two-round Delphi survey involving 46 experts from 8 countries was performed. Quantative and qualitative analisis permited the definition of the final consensus. Results: The initial proposal included 157 learning outcomes. The Delphi process generated 734 comments and involved the modification, deletion and addition of some outcomes. At the end of the process, a consensus was reached on 136 learning outcomes grouped under 6 competency domains with a high overall acceptance (95.1 %).

This research aims to understand learners' sensorial perception of materials as stimuli and what constitutes the most appropriate communication channel for learning about their characteristics without losing information in accordance with their VAK learning styles-visual, auditory and kinaesthetic-. Seventy-five people participated in this workshop. Using evaluation tools in a test format, they evaluated all the sensory properties of the following materials: Alusion (TM), PolarMoss, and Silkworms. These three materials were presented in various interaction formats, called channels: a text plus image-C1-, video-C2-, and a physical sample plus audio-C3-. Two types of experiments were carried out: mixed per person-interaction with the three materials in a different channel each time in random order-and blocked per person-interaction with the same material in the three channels, in an order of C1-C3. The data obtained was analysed using mixed models with the channel as a fixed factor and the individuals and material as the random factors. The most relevant results indicate significant differences between channels in accordance with the sensory property, normally C2 and C3. The level of responses between the two experiments is similar, therefore showing that the order C1-C2-C3 does not affect perception. Although the three learning styles-visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic-coexist in the participants, the vast majority agree that they prefer C3 as easier to evaluate, more entertaining and the best way to learn.","[Abella, Ainoa; Araya Leon, Maria; Cleries Garcia, Laura] ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain; [Abella, Ainoa; Marco-Almagro, Lluis] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain; [Araya Leon, Maria] Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile",,"Abella, A (corresponding author), ELISAVA Barcelona Sch Design & Engn, ELISAVA Res, La Rambla 30-32, Barcelona 08002, Spain.; Abella, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Spain.",aabella@elisava.net,,"Marco-Almagro, Lluis/0000-0002-0440-1675; Abella, Ainoa/0000-0001-6375-0317; Araya Leon, Maria Jose/0000-0001-7284-6943",,,,29,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

Latin America, as other developing regions, has increased its university enrolment of underrepresented, historically excluded students, through a variety of policies. This study analyzes the experiences of the first cohort of a national inclusive admissions program in Chile. Drawing from 45 in-depth interviews, it aims to understand how students perceive themselves and the obstacles they face, using academic literacy as a lens. Results show a recurring reproduction of dominant deficit discourses by the students, as they feel at a disadvantage and blame their previous education; additionally, negative self-perceptions are more frequent in students from the most competitive programs. Nevertheless, these perceptions contrast with student agency, resilience, and self-sponsored strategies that emerged in the interviews as resources for making sense of university, an unforeseen environment for the participants and their families. Furthermore, interviews reveal that these students face additional challenges pertaining to adverse material conditions that shape their university experience, such as commuting extremely long distances or working for a living. Overall, this research depicts a complex picture of intertwined factors that challenges the deficit framework and should be considered in developing equitable admissions policies. Both the structural disadvantages and the varied forms of agency found in this study offer insights for policy implementation and student support mechanisms, moving them away from the simple idea of individual underpreparedness toward institutionalized inclusive practices in expanding higher education systems.","[Avila Reyes, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Navarro, Federico] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Tapia-Ladino, Monica] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile",,"Reyes, NA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",naavila@uc.cl,"; Navarro, Federico/A-1538-2016","Tapia-Ladino, Monica/0000-0003-2951-1798; Navarro, Federico/0000-0001-9131-3245; Avila Reyes, Natalia/0000-0003-3528-6806","FONIDE (Ministry of Education, Chile) [1700046]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170723]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]","Funded by FONIDE (Ministry of Education, Chile) under Grant 1700046; FONDECYT under Grant 11170723; and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence under Grant FB0003.",,50,0,0,1,1,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1938-8926,1938-8934,,J DIVERS HIGH EDUC,J.

Its appearance during the first years of schooling is linked to school failure and dropout, violent behaviors, mental health problems, and maladaptive trajectories that persist for the rest of an individual's life. The goal of this study was to identify psychosocial adversity variables capable of predicting the appearance of SM during the first three years of school. By collecting data on school maladjustment, adverse childhood experiences and psychosocial dysfunction, a longitudinal follow-up process was applied to a cohort of 26,108 Chilean students (50.7% female) from the start of their schooling (6.3 years of age in 1st grade) until two years later (8.4 year age mean in 3st grade). Through binary logistic regressions, the results obtained show that mother's adolescent pregnancy, biological father's absence, mental pathology in a relative, psychosocial dysfunction, and teacher's negative perception of students' academic and behavioral performance predict the appearance of SM after three years in the school system. The article discusses these results and their implications for the development of preventive programs aimed at reducing SM and mental health problems during childhood.","[Vargas, Belen; Leiva, Loreto; Rojas-Andrade, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Maria Scquicciarini, Ana] Junta Nacl Auxilio Escolar & Becas, Programa Habilidades Vida, Santiago, Chile",,"Leiva, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",loretoleivab@u.uchile.cl,,,,,,73,1,1,2,5,COLEGIO OFICIAL PSICOLOGOS MADRID,MADRID,"C/CUESTA SAN VICENTE, NO 4, 6 PLANTA, MADRID, 28008, SPAIN",1135-755X,2174-0526,,PSICOL EDUC,Psicol.

The purpose of this study is to identify and describe different school climate profiles by evaluating variables at the individual, family and community levels in Chilean students. The sample consists of 2,683 adolescent students (51.2% men and 48.8% women), aged between 12 and 20 years (M = 15.78, SD = 1.35), and from 32 Chilean educational institutions. Results obtained from a multilevel latent class cluster analysis show that the model with six clusters of students and two class of institutions proves to be the most parsimonious model and with the best fit to the data. School climate profiles were built on the basis of four indicators: school climate (Wald = 301.065, p < .001), student-teacher relationships (Wald = 226.687, p < .001), positive attitude towards authority (Wald = 115.591, p < .001) and positive attitude towards norm transgression (Wald = 3705.593, p < .001). All of them are to be useful indicators for profile segmentation. Covariates that are associated with school climate profiles identified: at the individual level, age (p = .019) and sex (p < .001); at the family level, family structure (p < .001); at the school level, type of educational institution (p = .002); and at the community level, the perception of insecurity in the neighborhood (p = .011), social control (p = .002) and support (p < .001).

In order to do this, the present study is aimed at assessing the psychometric properties of the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation, an interview for teachers that measures school adjustment difficulties. The study evaluated 10,287 adolescents participating in a Chilean public program for improving mental health in schools. Of the total sample, 5,815 (56.5%) students were in 6th grade and were 12.91 years old on average (SD= 1391). Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify four dimensions (behavioral, learning, social, and autonomy-related difficulties), which were tested using structural equations. Reliability analyses show that all factors have high levels of internal consistency and differ according to age, grade, and extreme poverty.

Two questionnaires are answered by every student to assess school engagement and contextual variables. Information about school performance and percentage of attendance to classes is provided by holders of municipal schools. School engagement is considered as conformed by three subtypes of engagements (affective, cognitive and behavioural). Structural equation modelling is performed to determine the fit of model to data. The mediation model proposed presented a good fit (RMSEA=.045; CFI =.944, TLI =.940). Cognitive engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on school performance. Affective engagement has a direct positive and moderated effect on attendance to classes.

The graphic organizer group was taught using an 11-slide PowerPoint presentation on a social study topic that included two empty graphic organizers plus two additional slides explaining how to make a comparison. The content-based group was taught using the same presentation but without these additional slides plus a set of questions students had to answer as a class activity. The lessons were recorded and the verbal statements between instructor and students examined using the Flanders Interaction Analysis System. Results indicated significant differences in how instructors and students interacted in each group, including more questions asked by teachers (d = 1.99) and more students participating in the classroom discussion in the graphic organizer group (d = 1.76). Learning outcomes showed that the graphic organizer group outperformed the content-based group on a memory test (d = .45) and a comprehension test (d = .44).

Trained in different design education systems, these professionals can have different conceptual understandings about design. Recognizing and identifying these differences are key issues for establishing shared design practices within the educational community. Contributing to this understanding, we examined whether and how two different populations of students have different knowledge structures with respect to HCI design. We adopted the romantic, conservative and pragmatic dimensions, previously investigated in the related research, to elucidate those differences. This paper compares one specific type of design artefact-conceptual frameworks-created by groups of students with different educational backgrounds: Arts and Engineering. It was based on a set of 22 criteria divided by two main domains: scheme (addressing form) and realm (focusing on contents). The obtained results show that students with background in Engineering (1) focus more on the product of design; (2) rely less on conceptual frameworks to guide the design process; and (3) produce artefacts that are more constrained in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, definition of a symbolic system, and information organization and shaping. We suggest that conceptual frameworks serve to communicate and understand design practice. We note that Engineering students seem to be more susceptible to fixation than Arts students and suggest that an emphasis of reflection-in-action could help compensating this problem.","[Antunes, Pedro] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Xiao, Lu] Univ Western Ontario, Fac Informat & Media Studies, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Pino, Jose A.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago De Chi, Chile",,"Antunes, P (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Informat Management, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",pedro.antunes@vuw.ac.nz; lxiao24@uwo.ca; jpino@dcc.uchile.cl,"Pino, Jose/G-6404-2016; Antunes, Pedro A/B-8664-2008; Xiao, Lu/O-8014-2016","Pino, Jose/0000-0002-8466-6453; Antunes, Pedro A/0000-0002-5411-8798; Xiao, Lu/0000-0001-5420-1578",,,,32,5,5,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

Second, we partially cross-validated our results in a large and representative sample of 10,723 mothers and their children from the Chilean Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia (Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey). In both studies, the quality of care for children provided at home was measured with the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. In the MLCS study, additional indicators of the mother-child relationship were measured. Day care was not negatively associated with the mother-child relationship and maternal sensitivity, compared to maternal care, or with the quality of the home environment. Positive changes in attachment security were found in Mapuche children who attended day care centers. Practice or Policy: We were able to confirm that type of care was not differentially associated with quality of the home environment.","[Carcamo, Rodrigo A.] Univ Magallanes, Dept Psychol, Ave Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile; [Carcamo, Rodrigo A.; Vermeer, Harriet J.; van der Veer, Rene; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H.] Leiden Univ, Ctr Child & Family Studies, Leiden, Netherlands",,"Carcamo, RA (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, Dept Psychol, Ave Bulnes 01855, Punta Arenas, Magallanes, Chile.",rodrigo.carcamo@umag.cl,"van IJzendoorn, Marinus/P-4907-2019; carcamo, rodrigo/AAB-5231-2020","van IJzendoorn, Marinus/0000-0003-1144-454X; Carcamo, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9227-7132","National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research CONICYT, Chile (Becas Chile); FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140663]","This study was made possible by a grant awarded to the first author by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research CONICYT, Chile (Becas Chile) and FONDECYT 11140663.

Two predominant hypotheses have been developed in this regard: 1) difficulties in arithmetic appear due to a deficit in domain-specific skills (numerical skills) and 2) there is a strong relationship between the development of the domain-general processes and arithmetical skills. In this study we explore the specific contribution of orienting and executive control attentional networks to individual variability in basic mental arithmetic. Participants were elementary school children, from second to third grade, with and without difficulties in basic mental arithmetic. Results provide support for the two proposed hypotheses. Children with difficulties in arithmetic showed difficulties both in numerical skills and in attentional networks. These findings suggest that arithmetic difficulties may be associated with a heterogeneous combination of deficits, including difficulties in attentional functioning.","[Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Castro Canizares, Danilka] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile; [Kettlun Poblete, Rocio] Univ Desarrollo, Concepcion, Bio Bio, Chile; [Estevez Perez, Nancy] Ctr Neurociencias Cuba, Dept Neurodesarrollo Infantil, Havana, Cuba",,"Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.; Canizares, DC (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile.",danilka.castro@umayor.cl,,,"National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF) [ID18I10002]","Funding: This research was funded by two grants from the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), Chile: Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence (Grant FB0003), and The Scientific and Technological Development Support Fund (FONDEF, Grant ID18I10002).

Children, fathers, and mothers exhibited stereotypes that link math with males. More specifically, mothers identified more with language than with math, while fathers and children identified more with math than with language. Path analyses models revealed that children's explicit math self-concepts significantly predicted their actual math achievement. Children's explicit self-concept was, in turn, explained marginally by the mathematical anxiety of their mothers.Practice or Policy: These results contribute to our understanding of the relation between parental and children's beliefs and children's math achievement during early elementary school years. In countries such as Chile, with a significant gender gap in math achievement, these findings may highlight relevant aspects to consider when designing interventions aimed at educational equity and providing equal mathematical learning opportunities to boys and girls.","[del Rio, M.

Elements of coherence were assessed in both tasks, namely problem, resolution, and mental-states. The findings indicate that questions can scaffold the production of more coherent narratives. Narratives elicited after questions were judged to be more coherent than those produced before the question-answering task. In contrast, there were no differences between scores for the question answers in the different order conditions.

Cognitive, language and motor subscores (TEPSI) and receptive vocabulary scores (TVIP) obtained through direct testing of 24-to-48-month-old children (n = 7564) from the Chilean Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood were compared based on retrospective reports of care received as infants. Children who, as infants, had received one of four types of non-maternal care - center-based, grandparent, other relative, and non-relative care - were compared to those who had exclusively experienced maternal care (71.8%). Series of regressions with propensity score models (PSM) were performed. Compared to maternal care, children in center-based care and grandparent care had higher total TEPSI scores (d = .19, p < 0.05) (d = .19, p < 0.01) and TEPSI language subscores (d = .20, p < 0.05) (d = .20, p < 0.01), while those in grandparent care also had higher TEPSI motor subscores (d=.08, p < 0.05). In contrast, children in nonrelative care had lower TVIP receptive vocabulary scores (d= -.38, p < 0.01).

The focus of our inquiry is on Chile, one of the most economically unequal coun-tries in the world. We use data from the Longitudinal Early Childhood Survey conducted in 2010 and 2012, which contains information regarding infants aged 30 months on average ( n = 8,251). Early child-hood stimulation is examined using a multidimensional index that comprises three domains: caregivers' stimulation of cognitive-language, sensorimotor, and socio-emotional development. Our dynamic models show that the main factors that lead to less stimulation are low caregiver education, low-income house-holds, and large families. Specifically, it was found that an additional child being born within a two-year period decreases stimulation, indicating possible competition between siblings due to time and resource restrictions in the household. Furthermore, caregivers' performance in personality (BFI) and linguistic in-telligence (WAIS language) tests was found to be a more significant factor than operational memory. Taken together, these findings suggest the need for initiatives aimed at increasing equality in early child-hood stimulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The sensory modality used for learning affects grades. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 270-274, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00010.2011.-Second-year undergraduated students from 2008, 2009, and 2010 cohorts were asked to respond a questionnaire to determine their learning style preferences, the VARK questionnaire (where V is visual, A is aural, R is reading-writing, and K is kinesthetic), which was translated into Spanish by the author. The translated questionnaire was tested for wording comprehension before its application in the actual study. Using the results of the VARK questionnaire, students were classified as unimodal or multimodal and according to the first preferred sensory modality used for learning as V, A, R, or K learners. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and problems that required simple arithmetic calculations (arithmetic-type questions) were applied to the students. The relation between the main sensory modality used for learning and the grades obtained in each question type was analyzed both in unimodal and multimodal students. It was found that R unimodal students performed significantly better in arithmetic questions than A and K unimodal students (P < 0.001 by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test after ANOVA). R unimodal students also performed better than R multimodal students in arithmetic questions (P = 0.02 by a Mann-Whitney U-test). However, no differences were observed after MCQs in either unimodal or multimodal students with different first sensory modalities used for learning. When MCQ scores between unimodal and multimodal students were compared, no differences were detected. It was concluded that the sensory learning style used for learning affects student outcome when students receive arithmetic questions but not when MCQs are applied.","Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile",,"Ramirez, BU (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Ciencias Med, Estn Cent, Alameda 3363, Santiago, Chile.",beatriz.ramirez@usach.cl,,,Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [030801-RU],This work was funded by Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica Grant 030801-RU.,,22,19,20,0,14,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",1043-4046,1522-1229,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = iNP(o), where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and P-o the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and P-o (max) (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth FJ. G Gen Physiol 307: 97-129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at www.cecs.cl).","Ctr Estudios Cient, Valdivia, Chile; Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Santiago 6850240, Chile",,"Latorre, R (corresponding author), Ctr Estudios Cient, Ave Arturo Prat 514, Valdivia, Chile.",,"Alvarez, Osvaldo/I-1077-2013; Tuluc, Petronel/C-2527-2011","Alvarez, Osvaldo/0000-0001-8558-580X;",,,,20,78,78,0,13,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",1043-4046,,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

In some studies, a sex effect has been reported. Lectures are a teacher-centered learning activity. Therefore, it appeared interesting to evaluate if a stronger correlation between attendance and grades would occur in a face-to-face evidence-based medicine course with few lectures and more time dedicated to active learning methods. Small-group work and peer learning were used to foster deep learning and to engage students in their own learning process. Most of the time, students worked in small groups solving contextualized problems and critically analyzing the quality of published medical literature. Peer learning was also developed in collaborative evaluations, and constant feedback was provided. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high attenders would develop a higher self-perception of learning and obtain higher marks than low attenders. Student self-perceptions of their capacity to apply evidence-based medicine were measured by the application of an online self-assessment survey, and objective learning was measured as the grades obtained in a final accumulative individual test. It was found that male students obtained higher grades and were more confident in their achievements than their female peers, despite male and female student attendance being similar. In addition, attendance was correlated with the perceived capacity to apply evidence-based medicine only in male students and was not correlated with academic outcome.","[Ramirez, Beatriz U.] Univ Santiago Chile Usach, Fac Med Sci, Santiago, Chile",,"Ramirez, BU (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Escuela Med, Fac Ciencias Med, Estac Cent, Alameda 3363, Santiago 9170019, Chile.",beatriz.ramirez@usach.cl,,,,,,22,7,9,0,16,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",1043-4046,1522-1229,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

First, we analyzed the levels of resilience and internalized problems (defined as group of emotional symptoms) in children aged 9 to 12 years. Second, we examined whether the relationship between them varies according to the low or high vulnerability of school communities. METHODS About 1460 students from schools in northern Chile participated. A total of 52.6% were girls, and 47.4% were boys. The scales of internalizing problems of the System of Evaluation of Children and Adolescents (SENA) and the short scale of resilience (CYRM-12) were applied. Correlations in each group and differences between groups were analyzed using a MANOVA. A 2-level path analysis was also performed. RESULTS Resilience was higher in the context of low vulnerability while depression, social anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptomatology were greater in the context of high vulnerability. A 2-level path analysis showed that the slope of gender, anxiety, and depression symptomatology varies between schools and an interaction effect between vulnerability and anxiety symptomatology. CONCLUSION There are differences in the relationship between internalized problems and resilience according to whether the students belong to low or high vulnerability establishments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between internalizing problems and resilience.","[Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Flores, Jerome; Ramirez, Cristian; Diaz, Patricia; Duran, Claudia; Lopez, Lorena] CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Caqueo-Urizar, Alejandra] Univ Tarapaca, Inst Alta Invest, Calle Antofagasta 1520, Arica, Chile",,"Flores, J (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Psicol & Filosofia, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.; Flores, J (corresponding author), CJE, Ave 18 Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.",jflores@uta.cl; acaqueo@academicos.uta.cl; cristianramirezvallejos@gmail.com; diaz.patricia.psicologia@gmail.com; claudiafernandad.t@hotmail.com; lorenalopezreyes@gmail.com,,,[PIACIE160007],This research was funded by ANID PIACIE160007.,,46,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4391,1746-1561,,J SCHOOL HEALTH,J.

In men, we expect physical aggression (PA) and sociality to be negative predictors of academic performance. However, in women, PA would be a negative predictor of academic performance, and sociality a positive one. Our results report a negative association between academic performance and PA in both sexes. As we expected, social effect derived from the use of PA seems to be different for each sex, where men could display a rebellious attitude to increase chances of finding a mate. In contrast, results for women are not conclusive, because no relationship between academic performance and any aggressive mechanism, were predicted by sociality. We conclude that an evolutionary framework, which includes sex-specific hypotheses, is appropriate to obtain a holistic perspective of this phenomenon.","[Munoz Reyes, Jose Antonio; Polo, Pablo; Cavieres, Eduardo] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Estudios Avanzados, Valparaiso, Chile; [Guerra, Romulo] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Direcc Postgrad, Santiago, Chile; [Pita, Miguel; Turiegano, Enrique] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain",,"Reyes, JAM (corresponding author), Calle Traslavina 450, Vina Del Mar, Region De Valpa, Chile.",jose.munoz-cea@upla.cl,"Pita, Miguel/AAA-6505-2019; Pita, Miguel/L-2466-2013; Munoz-Reyes, Jose Antonio/D-2822-2012","Pita, Miguel/0000-0001-5106-5566; Pita, Miguel/0000-0001-5106-5566; Munoz-Reyes, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-6275-8456",,,,48,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1538-8220,1538-8239,,J SCH VIOLENCE,J.

Quantitatively, each article's edit history was analyzed by Wikipedia X-tools, references and media were counted manually, and two readability indices were used to evaluate article readability. This analysis revealed that each article was updated 8.3 +/- 6.8 times per month, and referenced with 33.5 +/- 24.3 sources, such as journal articles and textbooks. Each article contained on average 14.0 +/- 7.6 media items. The readability indices including: (1) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Test and (2) Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula demonstrated that the articles had low readability and were more appropriate for college students and above. Qualitatively, the sampled articles were evaluated by experts using a modified DISCERN survey. According to the modified DISCERN, 13 articles (32.5%), 24 articles (60%), 3 articles (7.5%), were rated as good, moderate, and poor, respectively. There were positive correlations between the DISCERN score and the number of edits (r = 0.537), number of editors (r = 0.560), and article length (r = 0.536). Strengths reported by the panel included completeness and coverage in 11 articles (27.5%), anatomical details in 10 articles (25%), and clinical details in 5 articles (12.5%). The panel also noted areas which could be improved, such as providing missing information in 28 articles (70%), inaccuracies in 10 articles (25%), and lack or poor use of images in 17 articles (42.5%). In conclusion, this study revealed that many Wikipedia anatomy articles were difficult to read. Each article's quality was dependent on edit frequency and article length. Learners and students should be cautious when using Wikipedia articles for anatomy education due to these limitations.","[Suwannakhan, Athikhun; Yurasakpong, Laphatrada; Meemon, Krai] Mahidol Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Anat, Bangkok, Thailand; [Casanova-Martinez, Daniel] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Med, Morphol Unit, San Felipe, Chile; [Montriwat, Punchalee] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Biol & Biol Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Limpanuparb, Taweetham] Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand",,"Limpanuparb, T (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Sci Div, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.",taweetham.lim@mahidol.edu,"Limpanuparb, Taweetham/A-6295-2011; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAA-1024-2020; Meemon, Krai/C-3803-2015; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/AAH-4643-2019","Limpanuparb, Taweetham/0000-0002-8558-6199; Meemon, Krai/0000-0001-5700-2646; Suwannakhan, Athikhun/0000-0001-9910-0244",Wikimedia Foundation [PHD/0087/2560],"The authors wish to thank the three anonymous experts who volunteered to participate in our study.

An explicit integral form for the speed is given, which is analytically integrable for some cases. We demonstrate general criteria to determine the critical speed at which the particle immediately leaves the surface.

The bound state probability profile decays exponentially away from the origin, with a profile width that increases monotonically with alpha, becoming an almost completely extended state when alpha-->2(-). At alpha =2, the bound state suffers a discontinuous change to a delta function-like profile. A further increase of a increases the width of the probability profile, although the bound state is stable only for alpha <2. The transmission of plane waves across the potential increases monotonically with <alpha> and is insensitive to the sign of the opacity Omega.

The method is based on the fact that eigenfunctions of bound states are square integrable. We use this property and a judicious ansatz inspired on its asymptotic behavior to obtain a differential equation that can be solved straightforwardly using a Fourier transform. The main advantage of the method is that it avoids the traditional and tedious convergence analysis using a series representation. The method leads to an integral representation of the wave function and provides insight into concepts such as energy quantization, spectrum degeneracy, and bound states.

Consumption of the transferred nucleophile is followed by discoloration of the organic phase. This transfer-consumption cycle can be repeated several times by shaking the two separated phases again, allowing students to finally grasp the whole process as a continuous repetition of these cycles. The experiment also links, through visualization, the important synthetic tool of PTC with abstract concepts based on molecular-orbital and hard-soft acid-base theories, invoked in the formation of a CT complex.","[Caroli Rezende, Marcos; Aliaga, Carolina; Vidal, Matias] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile; [Aliaga, Carolina] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Nanociencia & Nanotecnol CEDENNNA, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile; [Barriga, German] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Avda Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Santiago 7760197, Chile",,"Rezende, MC (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Avda Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago 9160000, Chile.",marcos.caroli@usach.cl,"Caroli, Marcos/H-3570-2019; Aliaga, Carolina/G-6024-2019","Aliaga, Carolina/0000-0002-1352-3164; Rezende, Marcos/0000-0003-2040-9009; Barriga-Gonzalez, German/0000-0002-9628-2414",Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140212]; Project USA [1555-VRIDEI-USACH]; CEDENNA [PB0807],"M.C.R. thanks Fondecyt Project 1140212, and G.B. and M.V. thank Project USA 1555-VRIDEI-USACH for research grants.

In 1998, some modifications were made in the objectives and contents of this final activity. The purpose of these modifications was to include and develop the concept of pharmaceutical care. The present study shows some results obtained through these modifications. Between 1998 and 2000, 187 students completed the new internship experience. Of this total, 143 (76.5 percent), worked directly with patients, with a maximum of 80.6 percent (50 students) in the year 2000. Between 1998 and 2000, 118 students (63 percent) preferred to have these practice experiences at adult and children's hospitals.

For that purpose we will use our water production plant, which produces distilled water for all the laboratories of our faculty. Objective. To design and evaluate a practical activity for teaching the operation and control of a plant for purified water production. Design. A practical activity using a distilled water production plant was developed; physicochemical parameters of the water were measured at different sampling points; the students of Unit Operations course were given a questionnaire and a survey on the design and contents of the practical activity. Assessment. Seventy percent of the students were able to explain the USP requirements for purified water, to decide how to choose the sampling points, and to evaluate the plant operation performance. Fifty-three percent of the students could establish the specific purification capability and limitations of the deionization step, but only 26% were able of proposing corrective actions in the case of failure of some of the system's parameters. Conclusion. The students' opinion regarding the practical activity and the design of the laboratory guide was positive. Four out of five objectives were reached, and future work is necessary for the students to be able to propose corrective action plans in the case of failure of the system's parameters.","[Tapia, C.; Sapag-Hagar, J.; Lopez, L.; Zunino, G.

The total power of radiation of an electron is usually derived in textbooks with the help of the relativistic formalism. But for the particular motion in a synchrotron, the total power of radiation is obtained here working in the ordinary three-dimensional physical space, where the calculations are conceptually easier to follow than in Minskowski space, especially for students who are taking a first course of electrodynamics.

Nevertheless, it was not always the case that engineering educators had a clear understanding of a paradigm or a strategy being used. Thus, after an exhaustive review of literature, this paper presents a guide for engineering educators that shows how the multiple didactic strategies are classified within the four educational paradigms found in engineering education (positivism, constructivism, socio-critical and communicative-critical).","[Forcael, Eric; Garces, Gonzalo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion, Chile; [Backhouse, Peter] Univ Bio Bio, Coll Engn, Concepcion, Chile; [Bastias, Elena] Univ Bio Bio, Pedag & Curriculum Dev Unit, Concepcion, Chile",,"Forcael, E (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion, Chile.",eforcael@ubiobio.cl; ggarces@alumnos.ubiobio.cl; pbackhou@ubiobio.cl; ebastias@ubiobio.cl,"Forcael, Eric/AAO-9671-2020","Forcael, Eric/0000-0002-3036-4329",Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [1171108/Fondecyt Regular],This work was partially supported by the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) under grant No. 1171108/Fondecyt Regular.,,150,5,6,2,7,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

This empathic ability can be extended to other species, based on the human ability to develop techniques to understand and communicate with animals. In education, the benefits of training professionals with ethical and empathic tools are known. Gender, diet, past experiences, and other factors can modify a person's levels of empathy toward humans and animals, and a relationship exists between both types of empathy. The aims of this study were to investigate some determinants of the level of empathy and to gain insight into the possible correlation between human-animal and human-human empathy. For this, the Animal Empathy Scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index by Davis were applied through an electronic survey system to freshmen and final-year students (n = 452) from five schools of veterinary medicine in Chile. The correlation between the empathy scores of both instruments and their association with individual factors were studied using Spearman's correlation, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results suggest that both instruments correlate significantly, and that gender, year of study, diet, and area of interest have a significant association with the score for empathy toward animals. This research shows that individual characteristics and changes that occur during veterinary training can affect students' attitudes toward animals.","[Calderon-Amor, Javiera] Univ Austral Chile, Anim Sci Program, Valdivia, Chile; [Luna-Fernandez, Daniela] Univ Chile, Ciencias Silvoagr & Veterinarias Program, Santiago, Chile; [Tadich, Tamara] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile",,"Tadich, T (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Santiago 11735, Chile.",tamaratadich@u.uchile.cl,"Tadich, Tamara A/H-9753-2013; Tadich, Tamara/U-6154-2019; Luna, Daniela/H-5312-2013","Tadich, Tamara A/0000-0003-1620-7770; Tadich, Tamara/0000-0003-1620-7770; Luna, Daniela/0000-0002-7229-3194; Calderon-Amor, Javiera/0000-0003-4183-2260",,,,65,13,14,1,42,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0748-321X,1943-7218,,J VET MED EDUC,J.

Whereas most of the debate tends to focus on core contents of nursing programmes, little has been discussed about the teaching in 'supporting subjects' with relevance to both nursing education and nursing practice. This article offers a perspective on sociology scholarship for applied professions by using the case of nursing programmes. Methodology: Syllabus is a rich source of data, and in its representational capacity it becomes both a discursive construction and a vehicle of ideology. Accordingly, we present a Critical Discourse Analysis of syllabi of nursing schools in Chile as to identify core contents and ideologies, and implied challenges for nursing education. Findings and discussion: We argue that while the syllabus as a discourse discloses a significant cleavage, the biggest challenge is precisely to challenge the ideologies constructed by and embedded in the syllabi. Our reflection thus points to a better interdisciplinary dialogue as to enhance the actual contribution of sociology to nursing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the first microscopes of the epoch was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, a deceptively simple device that contains a single ball lens housed in a metal plate allowing the observation of samples at up to x250 magnification. Such magnification was much greater than that achieved by rudimentary compound microscopes of the era, allowing for the discovery of microscopic, single-celled life, an achievement that marked the study of biology up to the nineteenth century. Since Leeuwenhoek's design uses a single ball lens, it is possible to fabricate variations for educational activities in physics and biology university and high school classrooms. A fundamental problem, however, with home-built microscopes is that it is difficult to work with glass. We developed a simple protocol to make ball lenses of glass and gelatin with high magnification that can be done in a university/high school classroom, and we designed an optimized support for focusing and taking photographs with a smartphone. The protocol details a simple, easily accessible, low-cost, and effective tool for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere without the need for a laboratory or complex tools. Our protocol has been implemented in classrooms in Chile to a favorable reception.","[Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Lab Ontogeny & Phylogeny, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Fdn Interdisciplinary Dev Sci Technol & Arts, DICTA, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Daniela P.] Univ Chile, Fac Med, MicroMundo Project, Santiago, Chile; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Marzullo, Timothy C.] Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile",,"Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.; Marzullo, TC (corresponding author), Backyard Brains Inc, Santiago, Chile.",tim@backyardbrains.com,,"Flores, Daniela/0000-0002-8542-0279","Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant; Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional [2019-21191885]; Chile ANID Project [ACT-1720099]; National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant [2R44 MH-093334]","Funding for the development of this activity was provided by Chile's CTI (Cultura, Tecnologia, e Innovacion) Grant, a national PhD scholarship from the Chile National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology/Doctorado Nacional/2019-21191885, Chile ANID Project ACT-1720099, and National Institute of Mental Health Small Business Innovation Research Grant 2R44 MH-093334: Backyard Brains: Bringing Neurophysiology into Secondary Schools.",,32,1,1,2,8,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,Rockville,"6120 Executive Blvd, Suite 600, Rockville, MD, UNITED STATES",1043-4046,1522-1229,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect and associated factors involved in an intensive course for learning advanced laparoscopic skills, which include validated teaching techniques. METHODS: General surgeons and final-year residents were analyzed after completing an intensive 5-session advanced laparoscopy course. Initial (IA) and final assessment (FA) consisted in performing a jejunojejunal anastomosis in a live porcine model, measured using objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) (GRS and SRS, that is, global rating scale and specific rating scale, respectively) and operative time (OT). The 3-session training was structured in a bench model with an ex vivo bowel. For the demographic analysis, 3 groups were defined according to the presentation of relevant changes in OSATS and in OT between IA and FA: group A, no changes; group B, change in 1 variable; and group C, change in both variables. RESULTS: After the course, all 114 participants presented a significant improvement in OT (37 vs 24.6 min, p < 0.001) and in OSATS; global rating scale (10.5 vs 16 points; p < 0.001) and Specific Rating Scale (8.5 vs 12.7 points; p < 0.001). In the IA, 70 (61%) participants completed the jejunojejunal anastomosis and 105(92%) in the FA (p < 0.01). In the FA, 56% of participants presented relevant changes in both variables (group C). This group was significantly younger (34 vs 45 vs 40 y old; p < 0.001), had fewer years of surgical experience (2 vs 9 vs 5 y; p < 0.001), and had a proportionally higher concentration of residents (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This intensive course is set out as a viable alternative to teach basic skills in advanced laparoscopy in a short period of time, which is ideal for surgeons with difficult access to training centers. It remains necessary to establish the participant profile for which this type of course is most beneficial.

This paper reveals significant limitations in the functioning, performance and productivity of the Senate, consistent with the evidence reported by the related literature. Our study suggests that these deficiencies are associated with (i) the institutional design and organisation of the Senate, (ii) ambiguity (legal and practical) in respect of its authority, (iii) structural discord with other governing bodies of the university and (iv) lack of legitimacy and recognition of the Senate by other governing bodies and the university community in general, consistent with the observed lack of electoral support and representation of its members.","[Nunez, Javier; Leiva, Benjamin] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",,"Nunez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",jnunez@fen.uchile.cl,,,,,,26,2,2,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-764X,1469-3577,,CAMB J EDUC,Camb.

It first provides some contextual information on the development of Chilean teacher education in the aftermath of the military dictatorship period (1973-1990) and of a research base within its institutions. Then it centres on how future teachers from 11 teacher education programmes report on their learning and growth processes before and after their final practicum, and refer to the contextual effects of school placement on these processes. To this end, questionnaires before and after the practicum experience were administered to an initial group of 152 future teachers and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 of these teachers as well as one observation in their classrooms and schools. The key elements examined were motivation, pedagogical satisfaction and self-efficacy, as well as conditions of practicum and teacher assessment of its effect on learning and commitment to teaching.","[Avalos, Beatrice] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bascope, Martin] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Avalos, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",bavalos@terra.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017",,,,,36,7,8,0,23,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",1682-3206,1947-9417,,EDUC CHANGE,Educ.

Some argue that school franchises offer educational services more effectively than small independent schools. Skeptics counter that large centralized operations create hard-to-manage bureaucracies and foster diseconomies of scale and that small schools are more effective at promoting higher quality education. We can gain insight into this debate by examining Chile's national voucher program. This paper uses 4th-grade data to compare achievement in private franchises, private independent, and public schools in Chile. Our findings suggest that franchises have a large advantage over independent schools, once student and peer attributes and selectivity are controlled for. We also find that further disaggregating school franchises widens the larger franchise advantage. We conclude that policies oriented to create incentives for private school owners to join or start up a franchise may have the potential for improving educational outcomes.","[Elacqua, Gregory; Santos, Humberto] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Microdatos, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Salazar, Felipe] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Elacqua, G (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Polit Publ, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.",gregory.elacqua@udp.cl,,"Elacqua, Gregory/0000-0003-0066-3640",,,,64,9,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0924-3453,1744-5124,,SCH EFF SCH IMPROV,Sch.

Rural schools are more than half of the schools in Chile.

The results show that inclusion has different meanings for different teachers, indicating that passage of the law has not been accompanied by a policy providing clear meanings to guide teaching practices. However, one meaning commonly shared is that inclusion, understood as the acceptance of everyone, is a duty of rural schools, a cultural feature that apparently distinguishes them from their urban counterparts.","[Gloria Nunez, Carmen; Gonzalez, Bryan; Ascorra, Paula] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Pena, Monica] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Hain, Andrea] Univ Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile",,"Nunez, CG (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.nunez@pucv.cl,,"Nunez, Carmen Gloria/0000-0001-7252-5031; Gonzalez Niculcar, Bryan/0000-0003-0644-0245","PIA-ANID [CIE 160009]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico, Tecnologico y de Innovacion Tecnologica [1211163]","This work was supported by PIA-ANID: [Grant Number CIE 160009]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico, Tecnologico y de Innovacion Tecnologica: [Grant Number 1211163].",,35,1,1,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-3116,1464-5173,,INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC,Int.

The sample was comprised of 124 students at two Chilean universities: one public and one private. After five weeks of implementation, the students' ability to recognize, analyse and design classroom verbal interactions increased significantly, with statistically significant differences by university and specialization but not by sex or socioeconomic level. Noteworthy is a positive relationship between the use of the game outside class and the ability to analyse and design classroom interactions.

In addition, teachers report a quite frequent use of some ICT resources, giving a high importance to students' learning of ICT. However, ICT integration is limited to a few specific resources (mainly computers and projectors), mostly applied to perform traditional pedagogical activities. Therefore, the expectations about the improvement of teaching and learning in Teacher Education in Chile through the integration of ICT, are not been fulfilled yet.

Design/methodology/approach Competing versions of Chilean educators' professionalism during the pandemic were analyzed based on government guidelines, national teachers' association statements, news reports and testimonies from teachers and principals collected from webinars. Findings The guidelines that the ministry issued after school building were required to close motivated educators to challenge a version of professionalism founded on new public management (NPM) policies, which mandated external control and emphasized students' academic outcomes. By challenging the dominant NPM perspective of professionalism, educators advocated for professional autonomy as well as students' and communities' well-being. Originality/value This essay offers insights into how the Chilean school system's response to the crisis evidenced competing notions of educators' professionalism. As the pandemic continues to be an ongoing phenomenon, four implications for reconceptualizing educators' professionalism are drawn, which could inform and offer guidance to practitioners and policymakers in the post-pandemic era.","[Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Beatriz Fernandez, Maria; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Madrid, Romina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Gonzalez, A (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile.",agonzalezt@ncsh.cl,"Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/ABA-3272-2021","Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409; FERNANDEZ COFRE, MARIA BEATRIZ/0000-0001-7639-2811",ANID/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003],"The authors wish to acknowledge the insightful comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewer(s) that helped strengthen this manuscript.

An analysis of 1370 papers130 indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection indexes and 1240 indexed in the Scientific Electronic Library Online index (SciELO)indicates that Latin American academics are engaged in lively practices of publication. However, a dual pattern of publication is identified, characterised by researchers extensively publishing in non-mainstream journals and also maintaining a presence in mainstream journals. Issues related to language, rankings and prestige, the North/South divide, the distinction between hard/basic and soft/applied sciences and the nature of higher education studies are used to explain such a pattern. Although there is a tense process of securing a dual epistemic recognition, there is also a positive tension that involves collaboration across a plurality of knowledges. Finally, this paper offers the concept of zones of epistemic influence, which opens spaces for an ecology of knowledges in which knowledges from both the North and the South constitute a new assemblage that accords due weight to a plurality of epistemic interests.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Gomez, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl; carolina.gomez@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; G—mez-Gonz‡lez, Carolina/AAT-1020-2020; Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Gomez-Gonzalez, Carolina/0000-0003-0202-085X","Conicyt-Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170374]; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]","This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1170374 and PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003.

Although the problem of underrepresentation of female physicists has several causes, one likely reason is the lower interest that female school students have in physics activities. Several instructional solutions have been proposed to spark girls' interest in physics, including recent ones with mobile devices. However, mobile devices could be problematic technologies for school students and teachers, particularly if guidance in their use is not provided. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of a novel mobile application guided with laboratory reports to increase high school students' interest in physics. We also investigated whether the intervention with mobile laboratory activities facilitated learning about an important physics topic, namely, understanding graphs. The study was conducted in eight eligible schools, totaling data from 268 high school students (57% females). Results showed that all seven measures of self-rated interest in physics received higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. One of the items, which assessed changes in understanding physics, showed greater effects on females than on males. Hence, the instructional mobile application under consideration helped to spark students' interest in physics, and the effect was somewhat greater in schoolgirls, but the intervention did not change the test scores about understanding graphs, failing to demonstrate an association between increased interest in physics and changes in physics educational outcomes. The instructional implications for these findings, as well as limitations and future research directions, are discussed.","[Carreno, Maria Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gallardo, Maria Jose] Univ Atacama, Sch Med, Copiapo, Chile",,"Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",maria.carreno.m01@mail.pucv.cl; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; mariajose.gallardo@uda.cl,"Gallardo, Mar’a JosŽ/ABH-2726-2021","Gallardo-Nelson, Maria Jose/0000-0003-2963-8692",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255]; CORFO [16PES-66152],"This study is funded by the ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003, ANID Fondecyt 11180255, and CORFO 16PES-66152.",,53,0,0,9,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1571-0068,1573-1774,,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

The present study is aimed at analyzing the types of obstacles identified by science teachers who participated in a Teacher Reflection Workshop (TRW) on the formulation and use of questions in their lessons. The workshop consisted of stage 1 (7 sessions), stage 2 (video recordings in school classrooms), and stage 3 (3 sessions). The discourses of 8 participating teachers in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and natural science at different educational institutions in the city of Santiago, Chile, were analyzed in this case study. The analysis was carried out by the professors participating in the workshop, based on the participants' identification, initial attempts to address, and proposals to overcome, their obstacles. In the earlier stages of the process, the identified obstacles had procedural characteristics, but as the process advanced, they took on a more epistemological nature. One of the main differences between the initial and final identification of obstacles by the participating teachers is that the latter were more precise and critical, and the teachers increasingly demonstrated the ability to propose specific solutions to teaching problems. Engagement with the obstacles does not take place uniformly but depends on the types of obstacles that the teachers identify in their practice. Proposals for overcoming the obstacles require the teachers to have time for reflecting and validating their ideas in their practice.","[Joglar, C.; Rojas, S.

It highlights the need to uncover assumptions and value orientations that are at the basis of these definitions and that tend to guide both conceptualizations and practices about the public role of the universities. It is argued that under neoliberal regimes, the public university takes on private aspects and the private university may even take on public aspects: Universities are here characteristically becoming hybrids. Despite these overlapping patterns, absences are discerned both in the idea and in the practices of public universities. The idea of the transformative university is proposed to help to remedy these deficiencies.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT; Fondecyt RegularComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]; Proyecto Redes [140084]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003],I want to thank the two anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

To address the potential bias due to the endogeneity of the competition among schools, an instrumental variable approach is implemented, using instruments associated with the size of each educational market. The results show that an increase of one standard deviation in competition among schools generates a moderate increase in standardized test results (0.06 standard deviations) and a more significant decrease in the other indicators of quality (between 0.02 and 0.16 standard deviations). Therefore, the results suggest a tension in the school between various objectives of educational policy, in which pressure to improve standardized test scores resulting from competition among schools could produce an undesired effect of deterioration in other dimensions of quality.","[Gajardo, Felipe] Univ Chile, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile",,"Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.",fgajardo@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl,,,Center for Conflict and Social Cohesion [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009],"The authors would like to thank Alejandra Falabella, Daniel Hojman and Juan Pablo Valenzuela for their comments and suggestions.

We found that mathematics anxiety can negatively influence pre-service teachers' expectations about students, and that future mathematics teachers' expectations of mathematics achievement are lower for girls than for boys. These effects are independent, as we did not find significant interaction effects between pre-service teacher's mathematics anxiety and student gender.

J,"Richards, H",,,,"Richards, Howard",,,Unbounded organisation and the future of socialism,education as change,,,English,Article,,,,,,accumulation; Alexander; central planning; Marxism; social democracy; socialism,,"This article starts with the question whether the socialism Neville Alexander advocated is a thing of the past or a prospect for the future. It considers two forms of 20(th)-century socialism, the centrally planned economy and social democracy, in the light of Marx's concept of accumulation. Accumulation' names both the logic of capitalism and the dynamic that drives it. A focus on the need to deal with the probability that the accumulation dynamic will falter in the process of moving from capitalism to socialism helps to explain socialism's decline. Unbounded organisation' is introduced as a broader concept that includes the bounded' social organisation that frames capitalism and its accumulation dynamic as a special case. It helps to both explain the decline of socialism and to suggest how to reverse that decline. It is suggested that the socialism of the future can best be defined not as a certain form of social organisation, but rather as the power of the people to choose the set of economic and other institutions that works best for them. Three of Alexander's contributions to building an unbounded socialism are found in his proposals for grass-roots organising at the neighbourhood level, in his promotion of multilingualism, and in his advocacy of alternative education.","Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Richards, H (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile.",howardri00@yahoo.com,,,,,,61,2,2,0,58,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1682-3206,,,EDUC CHANGE,Educ.

Joining the growing literature on university entrepreneurship, this is a case study on the less examined problem of entrepreneurial universities in developing countries. In a period of roughly 15 years, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica of Chile, founded in 1888, turned itself from a mostly teaching institution to a research-oriented university, responsible for one-fourth of the Chile's mainstream scientific output and 40% of all Ph.D.s awarded nationally. Yet, public funding represents today only 17% of its revenues, down from almost 90% in 1972. How such academic development could have occurred as the State withdrew and the market took hold of Chilean higher education after the reforms introduced by the military rule of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) is the theme of this work. Universidad Catolica's policies and strategies are described, and the factors contributing to its success, together with their limitations, identified. The case suggests that orientation to the market can be more a means for survival and growth under the pressure of privatization, than a result of a 'Triple Helix' strategy of universities, government and industry to generate innovation out of academic knowledge. Secondly, while in the industrialized world, higher education entrepreneurship is associated with knowledge production for economic development ('Mode 2'), entrepreneurial universities in the context of developing countries may just be finding their way to the academic, disciplinary mode of research.","Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile",,"Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.",abernasconi@utalca.cl,"Bernasconi, AndrŽs/I-9041-2012","Bernasconi, AndrŽs/0000-0001-8008-3747",,,,47,36,39,0,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,,,HIGH EDUC,High.

The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers' self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers' self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers' report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher's professional development.","[Saadati, Farzaneh] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Chandia, Eugenio; Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Santiago, Chile",,"Saadati, F (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.",farzaneh.saadati@gmail.com; chandiaeugenio7@gmail.com; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl,,"Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075","CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673, PAI AFB-170001]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]","CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral Project 3170673, Grant PAI AFB-170001, PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.",,60,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4416,1573-1820,,J MATH TEACH EDUC,J.

That is, we compare the performance of girls versus boys within schools with single-sex classrooms compared to the performance of girls versus boys within schools with coeducational classrooms, using a difference-in-difference approach with school fixed effects. In line with the results of the previous literature that has found positive effects for female students, we find that coeducational schools with single-sex classrooms reduce the math gender gap by more than half. The effect is consistent with an increase in the math achievement of female students with no decrease in the achievement of male students. Finally, this effect is not driven by teacher characteristics or student-teacher gender matching, but it seems to be driven by how female students respond to the gender composition of the classroom.","[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile",,"Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, DESOC, Santiago, Chile.",vparedes@fen.uchile.cl,,,Fondecyt InicioComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170968]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009]; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [NCS17_015],"This work was supported by Fondecyt Inicio [Project 11170968], the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) [ANID/FONDAP/15130009], and ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program-Code: NCS17_015.",,49,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1934-5747,1934-5739,,J RES EDUC EFF,J.

A particular issue is that of the presence of peripheral regions such as Latin America. The focus here is research into higher education reforms and, by using bibliometrics, a word frequency analysis and a thematic analysis, patterns of publication and themes in two different academic datasets - the global Web of Science and the more regional SciELO - are examined. Although the configuration of knowledge production on higher education reforms is seen as relatively homogeneous in certain respects, separate circuits of knowledge production are also revealed and even within a region (here, Latin America). Higher education reform is posed differently according to the publication circuits of journals and their position in global knowledge markets. A geopolitical imbalance in knowledge production is revealed and it is suggested that different regions of the world possess distinctive epistemic identities. The paper concludes by suggesting that there is room for negotiation between the different zones of epistemic influence.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Rios-Jara, Hector] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Queupil, Juan] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X","Conicyt-Chile, FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170374]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds [FB0003]","This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1170374.

To do so, the article begins by arguing that the university becomes part of the Enlightenment and accesses to modernity when the Faculty of Philosophy ceases to be conceptualized as the handmaiden of the Faculty of Theology (philosophia theologiae ancilla) and grows to be understood as the mistress' torchbearer, as ironically remarked by Kant. In the following decades, the new role that philosophy adopts in the division of academic labor changes the relationship of the institution with both the political and religious powers, opening the door on the road to the nation state and, further down, to the subordination of its activities to global academic capitalism. Consequently, traditional normative referents, as those proclaimed by Kant and Humboldt where universities were conceived as responsible for the evolution of modern society, lose plausibility and are subjected to the criticism of ideologies. The article concludes by examining future trends in education and research conducted in contemporary universities and by arguing that the crisis of the modern idea of the university is, in fact, an expression of its modern character that now turns against this very institution.","[Joaquin Brunner, Jose; Labrana Vargas, Julio Roberto] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Ciencias Desarrollo, Osorno, Chile; [Ganga, Francisco] Univ Los Lagos, Programa Invest Gobernanza & Inclus Org, Osorno, Chile; [Rodriguez-Ponce, Emilio] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile",,"Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Ave Ejercito 260, Santiago, Chile.",josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com; Julio.LabranaVargas@uni-wh.de; fganga@ulagos.cl; erodriguez@uta.cl,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021; Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/AAV-2527-2021","Ganga-Contreras, Francisco Anibal/0000-0001-9325-6459",,,,67,10,13,4,12,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

The work of Paulo Freire celebrated the liberating role that public university education should play in the training of citizens and professionals, that is with a critical and ethical conscience, committed to the needs of the locality, region and the world.

This paper draws on the experiences of 16 5-to 7-year-old children, transitioning from kindergarten to first grade in Chile as reported by them through visual participatory research. Integral to the ethical principles were the use of a visual participatory design, a listening framework and the child's rights perspective. In order to be faithful to the research design proposed, different ethical guidelines were revised and followed to ensure protection, anonymity, the right to withdraw and privacy to the children deciding to get involved in the research process. Essential to this work was recognising the child as the most knowledgeable agent in her/his own experiences in order to minimise issues of power and increase children's awareness during the data collection process. Findings from the study demonstrate different situations in which the researcher's selfreflexivity can enhance positive outcomes related to ethical issues and young children's ability to understand the research process, communicate meanings and jointly create new meanings through the tools provided and activities proposed.

Students criticized the privatization of higher education and the multiple flaws of this sector, which included corruption scandals during the process of quality assurance certification. After the end of the movement, the government announced a new quality assurance system, triggering public discussion over this issue in the media. The most influential newspapers and educational authorities participated actively in this debate. Through editorials and columns, these education agents constructed quality assurance discursively as a domain for experts, who have to design and administer quality standards for all educational institutions and actions. These procedures regulate and discipline educational practices, but professors and students are excluded from this debate. Thus, this quality assurance discussion reproduces the traditional neoliberal power relations in education and does not problematize the role of education in society.","Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile",,"Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile.",ccabalin@uchile.cl,"Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014","Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478",,,,45,7,8,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-8487,1750-8495,,CRIT STUD EDUC,Crit.

El Mercurio is more than a newspaper. It is an institution; an institution that supports conservative ideas. El Mercurio framed the public discussion about educational policies and defended neoliberal education based on three discourses: the neoliberal system is absolute, public education is valued less than private and education is a technical issue, not political. By invoking this rhetoric strategy, these discourses attempted to maintain the neoliberal education system in Chile, which in turn rejected the social struggles of the student movement.","Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile",,"Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile.",ccabalin@uchile.cl,"Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014","Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478",,,,44,17,21,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0159-6306,1469-3739,,DISCOURSE-ABINGDON,Discourse,OCT,2014,35,4,,,,,485,498,,10.1080/01596306.2013.871233,,,14,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,AM8MW,WOS:000340130900002,,,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,discourse-studies in the cultural politics of education,Q2

A total of 713 in-service mathematics teachers from various elementary schools participated in the survey study during 2015 and 2016. Results showed that teachers' traditional beliefs are directly associated with their teacher-centered practices, while there was an indirect relation among reformed beliefs and student-centered practices through teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and their beliefs about the value of problem solving. This association among beliefs and practices suggests that educators and policy makers should be aware of, when designing a teacher professional development, the need to emphasize other variables such as teachers' self-efficacy and value of the task.","[Saadati, Farzaneh; Cerda, Gamal; Reyes, Cristian; Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Dept Metodol Invest & Informat Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Giaconi, Valentina] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Reyes, Cristian; Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, CMM, Santiago, Chile",,"Saadati, F (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile.",farzaneh.saadati@gmail.com,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Cerda, Gamal/Q-7398-2017","Cerda, Gamal/0000-0002-3662-4179; Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075",FONDEF [ID14I20338]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2013 [21130684]; CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673],Funding from FONDEF ID14I20338 and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.

Using econometric analysis and controlling for potential confounding factors, we created an index of school performance combining outcome indicators focused on different school dimensions, and estimated the 2002/2010 evolution of school improvement for all Chilean schools with available data. Broadly, we estimated an average increase in the school performance of about 0.19 SD; nevertheless, while 41% of the schools increased their educational performance by at least 0.1 SD, 25% of the schools decreased it during the same period; we also found that improving school effectiveness was more probable among schools with lower student socioeconomic status (SES). Finally, we found that the observed school improvement trajectories tended to be non-linear; thus, we estimated that only 13.4% of the schools improved their performance in a systematic way during the entire decade.","[Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Bellei, Cristian; Allende, Claudio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Valenzuela, JP (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",jp.valenzuelab@gmail.com,"Bellei, Cristi‡n/D-9921-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017","Bellei, Cristi‡n/0000-0001-6963-7809; Allende, Claudio/0000-0002-6628-1787",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; PIA-CONICYT ANILLOComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS [SOC-1104]; Unicef; University of Chile,This study was supported by the PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [grant number BF0003]; the PIA-CONICYT ANILLO [grant number SOC-1104]; and a cooperation agreement between Unicef and the University of Chile.,,47,14,14,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0924-3453,1744-5124,,SCH EFF SCH IMPROV,Sch.

The study estimated the magnitude and evolution of the SES segregation of schools at both national and local levels, and it studied the relationship between some local educational market dynamics and the observed magnitude of SES school segregation at municipal level. The main findings were: first, the magnitude of the SES segregation of both low-SES and high-SES students in Chile was very high (Duncan Index ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 in 2008); second, during the last decade, SES school segregation tended to slightly increase in Chile, especially in high schools (both public and private schools); third, private schools - including voucher schools - were more segregated than public schools for both low-SES and high-SES students; and finally, some market dynamics operating in the Chilean education (like privatization, school choice, and fee-paying) accounted for a relevant proportion of the observed variation in SES school segregation at municipal level. These findings are analyzed from an educational policy perspective in which the link between SES school segregation and market-oriented mechanisms in education plays a fundamental role.","[Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [de los Rios, Danae] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile",,"Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile.",cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Bellei, Cristi‡n/D-9921-2015","Bellei, Cristi‡n/0000-0001-6963-7809",,,,96,179,210,4,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

The study analyses and discusses the ideas regarding the emergence of a new generation of learners, or digital natives, as characterised by wide-ranging access to digital media and by having new skills and abilities. In-depth interviews held with students and teachers from four different cities in the country are analysed. The data shows evidence of a generation of learners without shared traits, with segments of learners presenting practices that do not characterise the entire generation. In addition, the data shows that the skills and abilities described in the literature do not represent a precise description of those that the students exploit when using technology. Beyond the ability to work simultaneously on several tasks, some learners have the ability to manage the attention that they pay to their work on the computer in sophisticated ways, and although some prefer images to words on paper, among others, there is still a taste for reading actual printed books. All in all, students and teachers describe a certain distance and conflict between the practices with the use of ICTs and their everyday school experiences.","[Sanchez, Jaime] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 2777, Chile; [Contreras, David; Meyer, Eduardo] Pontificial Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Sanchez, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Blanco Encalada 2120, Santiago 2777, Chile.",jsanchez@dcc.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Salinas, Alvaro/F-9959-2012","Salinas, Alvaro/0000-0001-9655-761X",,,,19,26,30,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

To address this issue, we use a measure of competition that captures three major characteristics of market competition in a spatial context: the number of competitors, based on distance buffers; the size of competitors, measured by the enrollment of voucher schools; and the geographical distance among public schools and their competitors. To control for the potential endogeneity of our measure of spatial competition on public schools' efficiency, we use an instrumental variable based on the discontinuites generated by admissions municipality boundaries . We do not find evidence that public schools' efficiency increases or decreases as the result of the increment of voucher schools located near to public schools, an increase in the enrollment of existing voucher schools, or both factors simultaneously. This result is robust to: (1) the limit of education market or other measures of spatial competition; (2) the methodology used to compute the efficiency measures; and (3) whether we explain efficiency or educational performance.","[Quintero-Fragozo, Camilo; Cortes, Yasna] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile; [Sarrias, Mauricio] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile",,"Quintero-Fragozo, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile.",camilo.quintero@alumnos.ucn.cl,"Sarrias, Mauricio/L-7627-2018","Sarrias, Mauricio/0000-0001-5932-4817",,,,91,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

However, not all ICT usage models are designed to affect student outcomes. Therefore, to accurately study the impact of ICT, the concept of an educational programme supported by ICT must first be defined. The authors propose the ICT for Education (ICT4E) programme, an evidence-based framework to determine a model's ability to produce improvements before having to evaluate its results. The framework has four components: implementation, intervention, transference and total cost. Based on an explicit definition of the outcomes pursued by a given programme, this framework supports the design of its activities to promote sustainable changes in pedagogical practices in schools and calculate the programme's total cost. The authors illustrate this with a programme implemented in six countries. In Chile, the ICT4E programme forms part of the policy for educational technology, evaluating the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives.","[Rodriguez, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Dombrovskaia, Lioubov] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Informat, Santiago, Chile",,"Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",prodriguez@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Rodr’guez, Patricio/F-8606-2015","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Rodr’guez, Patricio/0000-0002-7361-5132",,,,113,15,16,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1475-939X,1747-5139,,TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC,Technol.

The article focuses on the ease of School Arithmetic. Using the Anthropological Theory of Didactics (Chevallard, 1999) and the Theory of Didactic Situations (Brousseau, 1990). the investigation began with the nuclear mathematical learning and contents of the current official elementary school programs in mathematics. Then, it continued with the observation and analysis of teaching-learning processes developed for arithmetics in elementary schools in the Metropolitan Region and ended with the analysis of the institutional restrictions imposed by schools for the development of those processes. We identified the phenomenon of the progressive inhibition of some mathematical abilities of students through elementary school. The students not only stop learning vital mathematical subjects for their academic and cognitive development at a timely curricular moment, but also a progressive stagnation in their development abilities is caused, especially during the second basic cycle.","[Espinoza, Lorena] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Matemat, Santiago, Chile; [Barbe, Joaquin; Galvez, Grecia] Univ Santiago Chile, Grp Felix Klein, Santiago, Chile",,"Espinoza, L (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Matemat, Santiago, Chile.",lorespinoz@gmail.com; quimbarbe@gmail.com; grecia.galvez@gmail.com,"espinoza, lorena/I-2215-2015; Barbe, Joaquim/Q-5419-2017","espinoza, lorena/0000-0002-8752-3423; Barbe, Joaquim/0000-0002-7260-5178",,,,15,2,5,0,2,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0212-4521,2174-6486,,ENSEN CIENC,Ensen.

Following up a qualitative tradition, a purposive sample was used which considered 13 ECEC settings, from the 2 leading providers of public ECEC in Chile: JUNJI (the National Board of Nurseries for its acronym in Spanish) and Integra Foundation. Different techniques were used for data collection: semi-structured interviews with principals, ECEC teachers, teaching assistants, and parents. In addition, a shadowing technique was used to observe principals. Findings show that ECEC principals' leadership is based on limited space to develop a pedagogical leadership due to a high administrative workload, alongside strong ethics of care fostered by principals, which are shared by the educational community - ECEC teachers, teaching assistants and families. We aim to generate knowledge about ECEC leadership for the Latin American context, particularly for the Chilean case, where we do not have any evidence about this topic.","[Opazo, Maria-Jose] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Opazo, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.",mariajose.opazo@ciae.uchile.cl,,,ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003],Support from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.,,44,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-293X,1752-1807,,EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC,Eur.

To achieve this, the discussion that has taken place in these countries about the importance of sentence grammar in the teaching of writing is analysed. Three proposals for the contextualised teaching of grammar are systematised from the literature review: those that are focused in the writing process, those focused on metalinguistic reflection and those with a greater emphasis in the grammar of text. Besides, the school curricula of 14 Spanish-speaking countries that were involved in the international assessment of TERCE are examined. This analysis shows an evident attachment to the communicative approach of grammar. This means that in almost all countries grammar is taught linked to the linguistic skills of reading, writing or orality, with an especial emphasis in writing. Also, two tendencies can be observed in the curricula of this countries, that guide the way in which curricula use sentence grammar to have an impact on written communication: (i) from sentence grammar to text grammar and (ii) from text grammar to sentence grammar.","[Sotomayor, Carmen; Chaf, Gabriela; Osorio, Gabriela; Jeldrez, Elvira] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Julia Coloma, Carmen] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Dept Fonoaudiol, Santiago, Chile",,"Sotomayor, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.",csotomayor@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017",,PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT]Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160471],This work was supported by PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence [Project FB 0003]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [FONDECYT No1160471].,,61,1,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-1522,1470-1146,,RES PAP EDUC,Res.

SNA enables a deep exploration of learning and development as a by-product of social interactions. Research findings from social networks for creativity has found specific social structures that ease knowledge transfer and the emergence of creative ideas in a variety of contexts. This work links the research findings in social networks and creativity with education and classroom activities, to provide a framework from which to understand social interactions in the classroom and to inform educational improvement. By conceptualizing learning and problem solving as the creative outcome of both cognitive and social processes, this paper describes how different forms of collaboration and social structures might emerge based on teaching and learning practices enacted in the classroom through the lens of social network analysis. In addition, attention to the classroom network should inform teachers on areas for pedagogical innovation. Subsequently, I propose guidelines on how to advance pedagogical decision-making for learning and creativity based upon students' social networks.

This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades. These results offer empirical support of self-assessment for learning and the use of poster construction as effective pedagogical strategies in science teacher education.","[Navarro, Federico] Univ OHiggins, Inst Educ Sci, Rancagua, Chile; [Orlando, Julieta; Vega-Retter, Caren] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Roth, Alejandro D.] Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, 3425 Las Palmeras St, Santiago 7800003, Chile",,"Roth, AD (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, 3425 Las Palmeras St, Santiago 7800003, Chile.",alejroth@uchile.cl,"Orlando, Julieta/E-1399-2014; Navarro, Federico/A-1538-2016; Roth, Alejandro/A-5086-2009","Orlando, Julieta/0000-0002-2902-8870; Navarro, Federico/0000-0001-9131-3245; Roth, Alejandro/0000-0001-5679-8136",PMIUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) [UCH1501-FIDOP 2016-36]; PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1191069],"Support from PMI UCH1501-FIDOP 2016-36, PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003, and FONDECYT 1191069 is gratefully acknowledged.

Professional development programs are proposed as effective mechanisms to fabricate the new teacher. However, this teacher has proved hard to produce. Thus, the resistor teacher has emerged into the field as a way to explain failure within school mathematics reform. In this article, I assume that resistance is a consequential response against particular forms of subjectivation imposed on mathematics teachers. Using conceptual tools from Hall and Foucault, I explore the ways wherein a high school mathematics teacher reinvents meanings of being a mathematics teacher in the context of a professional development program aimed to implement problem-solving instruction. Against the myth of the resistor teacher unwilling to change, what emerges is a process of struggle over meaning. School mathematics reform, considered as an ideological event, becomes a site in which competing meanings about being a mathematics teacher are negotiated, contested, and resisted.","[Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Valoyes-Chavez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",luz.valoyes@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3180238],Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and CONICYT/FONDECYT #3180238 is gratefully recognized.,,47,4,5,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-1954,1573-0816,,EDUC STUD MATH,Educ.

Based on available material and secondary sources, it describes the main features of this student movement, analyses the key components of the students' discourse and its relationship with the Chilean market-oriented educational system, and identifies its impact on the field of higher education. The paper argues that this student movement was a process of expressing accumulated grievances against some neoliberal features of Chilean education. Since this movement is also linked to the emergence of a new generation of higher education students, it identifies relevant characteristics of current students' organisations and protests. Finally, the paper discusses hypotheses for interpreting the recent student movements. This case is informative not only for those concerned with student participation, but also with the potential downsides of market-oriented educational policies.","[Bellei, Cristian; Orellana, Victor] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Dept Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Cabalin, Cristian] Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile",,"Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl,"Bellei, Cristi‡n/D-9921-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014","Bellei, Cristi‡n/0000-0001-6963-7809; Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478; Orellana, Victor/0000-0001-9599-966X",,,,46,63,77,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

Second, the results of the analysis of what teachers did are outlined; the impact on students and the type of teaching and learning activities in use. Results show that these projects did not provide evidence of having impact on students' learning as defined in the national curriculum. However, they show that students participating in these projects could learn other things, had the opportunity to develop abilities defined as cross-curricular and practised ICT related skills.

Given their consequences, and the high stakes derived from them, assessment systems put pressure on schools to an extent where their practices and internal policies adapt to the logic of these mechanisms. The behaviours that emerge from this adaptation are seen as gaming the system' and are often portrayed as the responsibility of test users. However, the article aims at pushing the question around the consequences of metrics further, in terms of what these strategic gaming behaviours are adapting to and to what extent predominant metrics are accomplishing their assumptions of social justice. Through theoretically discussing the concept of social justice in connection with educational assessment, the paper problematises whether current metrics and their consequences, on the one hand, are able to respond to their underlying principles of equality of opportunity, which are characteristic of justice as distribution, and, on the other hand, highlights the insufficiency of these principles to respond to current developments of the concept of social justice with regard to the dimensions of recognition and participation, with considerations for their potential inclusion in future assessment systems.","[Florez Petour, Maria Teresa; Rozas Assael, Tamara; Gysling, Jacqueline; Olave Astorga, Jose Miguel] Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile",,"Petour, MTF (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Studies Educ Assessment, Santiago, Chile.",mtflorez@u.uchile.cl,,,,,,60,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

Uncertainty, however, still exists in terms of the quality assurance consistency in the current Chilean accreditation system, especially in terms of the relation between public policy quality indicators for higher education and their relation to accreditation outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to make a first explorative attempt to investigate the relationships between these indicators and the results of undergraduate programme accreditation. We hypothesised that the public policy quality indicators of first-year drop-out rate, employment at graduation and ratio of actual to expected time to graduation would be strongly correlated to undergraduate programme accreditation as well as largely explaining its accreditation-year variance. By means of correlation and multiple regression analyses, we found small-sized associations, being first-year drop-out the only significant predictor of programme accreditation, explaining a 9.4% of its variance. These results raise questions regarding the consistency between the aims of public policy for higher education and the current accreditation system. This study should be of value to policy makers, managers and curriculum developers in terms of this initial analysis of the consistency between quality indicators and the accreditation system. Further research is necessary to make a systematic and in-depth assessment of the impact of quality assurance mechanisms to provide better rationale for making important decisions such as when defining the characteristics of the accrediting institutions as well as for establishing effective ways to achieve the proposed public policy objectives.","[Jerez, Oscar; Orsini, Cesar; Hasbun, Beatriz; Lobos, Eduardo; Munoz, Marcos] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, Cesar] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile",,"Jerez, O (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Nivel 1,Torre 26, Santiago, Chile.",ojerez@fen.uchile.cl,"Lobos, Eduardo/AAI-8022-2020; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Jerez, Oscar/J-2947-2016","Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Jerez, Oscar/0000-0003-0869-5938",,,,52,6,6,4,60,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0952-8733,1740-3863,,HIGH EDUC POLICY,High Educ.

An activity in this context is defined as a sequence of actions that an actor may perform to accomplish a task objective. The proposed methodology validates a design experimentally by comparing the actions it specifies with those that are observed in an actual activity. Analyzing the data collected through such observation is central to determining which actions would improve the social dynamics of the original design. The criteria for adopting a discovered pattern will depend on the activity's aims and the kind of actions observed. The proposed methodology is illustrated using data gathered during physics classes in two schools. The findings suggest that when formulating technologically mediated activities inside a classroom, designers should seek to incorporate face-to-face actions that support the dynamics of the activity and assist in achieving the social objectives of the tasks performed. The inclusion of such actions in design upgrades can also help prevent the occurrence of actions that interfere with the activity.","[Francisca Capponi, Maria] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Marshall, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Math, Santiago, Chile; [Ester Lagos, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Comenius, Santiago, Chile",,"Capponi, MF (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile.",mcapponi@inacap.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; gm@mat.puc.cl; maria.lagos@centrocomenius.org,"Marshall, Guillermo/F-2302-2011",,,,,40,6,8,0,13,"NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN",DOULIU CITY,"NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Chile in comparative perspective,higher education,,,English,Article,,,,,,affiliation; Chile; differentiation; diversification; interorganizational relationships; isomorphism; new institutionalism; organizational linkages; private higher education; proprietary higher education; relationship magnitude,INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; PATTERNS,"The expansion of private sectors of higher education has usually been regarded as a factor of diversification in higher education systems. Some of this differentiation has been found to arise from the affiliation of private institutions with organizations outside the field of higher education. This article reports the results of a study of this form of interorganizational relationship in private universities in Chile. Cases include universities founded or sponsored by religious, business and military organizations. A typology of private universities is proposed, on the basis of the forms affiliation (or its absence), was observed to take in the cases examined. Weak and strong forms of affiliation are described, and affiliated universities are compared to proprietary universities, i.e., those owned by individuals who govern them from their positions in the board of directors, and independent universities, in which governance lies with internal-academic or administrative-constituents. Albeit derived from the case of Chile, the typology could be applied to the analysis of private higher education in other national systems. The second part of the article seeks to ascertain whether affiliation operates as a source of differentiation in Chilean private higher education. Results show that, compared to the other types of private universities, the affiliated ones possess distinctive mission statements and declarations of principles, consistent with the orientations of their sponsor institutions, they tend to be smaller, and to have more full-time and better qualified faculty. Some receive financial support from their sponsor organization or its members. Distinctiveness was not found in indicators of prestige and student selectivity, nor in tuition levels, program offerings, curriculum design, the weight of research and graduate programs in their functions, student socioeconomic profile, and faculty involvement in governance. This is not to say that there are no differences in these dimensions among private universities: much diversity exists, but most of it cuts across all categories of interest for our study. Overall, affiliation does not appear to be a strong factor behind the diversification that exists in the Chilean private university sector.","Univ Talca, Sch Law, Talca, Chile",,"Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Law, POB 747, Talca, Chile.",abernasconi@utalca.cl,"Bernasconi, AndrŽs/I-9041-2012","Bernasconi, AndrŽs/0000-0001-8008-3747",,,,56,18,23,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Two segregation indices, the dissimilarity index and the square root index, are used to meet these objectives. The results show high and persistent segregation for high socioeconomic status students, in contrast to the moderate and decreasing segregation levels seen in the low and middle socioeconomic groups. Besides, the decomposition exercise posits the universities as the focus of segregation in this system, where both the institution and the degree program constitute relevant factors in understanding the unequal distribution of high socioeconomic status students. These results invite an in-depth look at the mechanisms that hinder social integration in this area, with a particular emphasis on the segregation of the highest socioeconomic status students, whose place in this system promotes their academic and social differentiation.","[Kuzmanic, Danilo; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Luisa Quaresma, Maria] Univ Autonoma Chile, Inst Iberoamericano Desarrollo Sostenible, Santiago, Chile",,"Kuzmanic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.",danilo.kuzmanic@ciae.uchile.cl,,"Quaresma, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-5292-2603; Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213","ANID, FONDECYT [1170371]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]","This work was supported by ANID, FONDECYT under Grant Regular Project #1170371.

The majority of paper-based options can be classified as being either multiple-choice or constructed-response. Therefore, in the process of creating an educational drill-and-practice video game, one fundamental question to be answered is which is the most appropriate response format? This paper answers this question, proposing a hybrid format that we call fine-grained multiple-choice, where the player constructs their response one element at a time, with each element chosen from a pre-defined set. A comparative study was conducted with second grade students. When comparing the impact of an educational drill-and-practice video game that uses multiple-choice with one that uses fine-grained multiple-choice, we observe that the fine-grained multiple-choice game achieved better results. However, the multiple-choice game was substantially more successful at capturing the students' interest and motivation. Considering the widespread use of the multiple-choice format in game-based learning activities, as well as in interactive activities, this research suggests rethinking what the most suitable answer format might be for each area of the curriculum and for the different types of games.","[Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile; [Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Grass, Antonio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile.; Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Parinacota, Chile.",vagner.beserra@gmail.com,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748",CONICYT - FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca,This work was supported by CONICYT - FONDECYT [1120177]; Vice-rectorship of Research at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Directorate General of Research at Universidad de Tarapaca.,,88,3,3,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1049-4820,1744-5191,,INTERACT LEARN ENVIR,Interact.

The proposed model, called ICTE-MM (ICT in School Education Maturity Model), has three elements supporting educational processes: information criteria, ICT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on ICT, five Leverage Domains are defined: Educational Management, Infrastructure, Administrators, Teachers and Students. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model's elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two elements establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international standards and best practices for ICT management. It has been validated through data collection instruments and its associated web-support tool was also refined with a small pilot study. In summary, the proposed ICTE-MM model provides a basis for self-assessment and improvement planning. It is not just a diagnostic tool but has also been found to be useful for guiding the principals in ICT investment.","[Solar, Mauricio] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Sabattin, Jorge; Parada, Victor] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Solar, M (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.",mauricio.solar@usm.cl; jorge.sabattin@usach.cl; victor.parada@usach.cl,"Solar, Mauricio G./A-1109-2008; Solar, Mauricio/AAE-9673-2020; Sabattin, Jorge/P-2589-2019","Solar, Mauricio/0000-0002-4433-4622; Sabattin, Jorge/0000-0003-0270-6560",,,,32,36,37,4,40,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN",TAIPEI,"129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

The analysis is based on the data from a national study aimed at measuring students' Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills for learning. A factor analysis was carried out to categorize students' activities with computers and several indexes were constructed to define the comparison groups. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explain the frequency of the activities. Results show that students with access to computers at home mainly perform activities categorized as Socializing, Academic, Gaming and Production and that although the absolute frequency of these activities differs across groups, the profiles of computer use are surprisingly similar for groups based on students' socio-economic group, experience with ICT, and self-confidence in the use of ICT. The only variable that discriminates user profiles is gender. Based on these findings, it can be claimed that Chilean secondary students with access to computers at home tend to show a rather homogenous computer-use profile, once access is equated.","[Enrique Hinostroza, J.; Matamala, Carolina; Labbe, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena; Cabello, Tania] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile",,"Hinostroza, JE (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Inst ICT Educ, Temuco 0830, Chile.",enrique.hinostroza@iie.cl,"Hinostroza, J.

In the context of attempts to address criticism that the sector is not free, public or high-quality enough, this article examines the association between education and its moral and ethical dimensions, and their separate yet complementary consideration alongside economic development, through the two centuries of the Chilean state's existence. Since the beginning of the current decade, discontent with the framing and performance of higher education as a whole has grown. The overview traces this process not as fresh crisis, but part of a social question pondered repeatedly in the past and supported with varying success through educational and political initiatives. This historical (and historiographic) approach illuminates the limits of conceiving of higher education as either an economic good or as a human right, and an overlooked need to support its benefits through policy. Not simply an interpenetration with economic thinking, but also a lack of sufficient appreciation of Chile's fundamental and singular character, present as challenges in understanding expanded access's function and its prospective contribution to growing debates around ethics and inequality.","[Leihy, Peodair; Salazar, Jose M.] Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Leihy, P (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Div Acad, Valparaiso, Chile.",pete.leihy@uv.cl,,"Salazar, Jose/0000-0003-4636-1779; Leihy, Peodair/0000-0002-5569-0905",,,,57,6,7,3,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Data was obtained from interviews and surveys applied to teachers and students from 145 rural schools. Results show that teachers function as gatekeepers. They do not teach students how to use ICT explicitly, but when teachers have high expectations, skills and technology access, this leads to conditions for students learning how to use ICT. Finally, the data contributes to a better understanding of the new role that teachers and schools play in rural areas in terms of social and symbolic integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Participation in these platforms has increased practices of meaning-making associated with vernacular literacies. Digital production on Instagram articulates traditions from vernacular writing and photography and is characterized by the mass-circulation, hybridized genres and texts, and the centrality of the image. In this article, I examine the role of image as a precursor of meaning and writing on social media, and the functions and patterns of production present in the practices of 2 Chilean young people. The functions of documentary and testimony; self-expression and identity; sociality, audience, and participation are interwoven with each other and with the patterns that organize the knowledge associated with the production. Based on this discussion, I offer some suggestions in order to broaden the understanding and teaching of writing and digital literacies.","[Valdivia, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile",,"Valdivia, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac & Imagen, Santiago, Chile.",andrea.valdivia@uchile.cl,,"Valdivia, Andrea/0000-0003-3956-1705",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Advanced Human Capital Program],This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Advanced Human Capital Program].,,20,0,0,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0040-5841,1543-0421,,THEOR PRACT,Theory Pract.,APR 3,2021,60,2,,,SI,,172,182,,10.1080/00405841.2020.1857139,,JAN 2021,11,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,RJ4BF,WOS:000608921600001,,,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,theory into practice,Q2

The research hypothesis is that the university's management, as a dependent variable, is impacted by self-assessment. The data gathering process was structured in three methodological steps: Step 1 considered the consistency analysis to evaluate the use of managerial language and visualize any consequences of planning documents after self-assessment. Step 2 involved the elaboration of a semi-structured interview that was applied to a sample of 12 key informants with the objective of encouraging qualitative categorization regarding the self-evaluation process and its effects. Step 3 entailed the construction of a questionnaire that would allow for a quantitative description. Several impacts have been reported analyzing the results from three main perspectives: organizational learning, cultural shift, and university and stakeholders.","[Busco, Carolina] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Ind, Vergara 432, Santiago, Chile; [Dooner, Cecilia; d'Alencon, Andres] Univ Chile, Unidad Autoevaluac Acreditac & Calidad, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Chile",,"Busco, C (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Ind, Vergara 432, Santiago, Chile.; Dooner, C; d'Alencon, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Unidad Autoevaluac Acreditac & Calidad, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Chile.",carolina.busco@udp.cl; cdooner@uchile.cl; dalencon.andres@gmail.com,,,,,,43,6,7,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Most schools in Chile provide either primary or secondary education. The authors analyze the effect of private voucher education on students who are forced to enroll at a different school to attend secondary education once graduated from primary schooling-structural switches. Moreover, the data set the authors use in this article contains information on previous academic achievement and thus allows them to identify differences in students' unobservable characteristics. Using a number of propensity-score-based econometric techniques and the changes-in-changes estimation method, the authors find that private voucher education leads to small, sometimes not statistically significant differences in academic performance. The estimated effect of private voucher education amounts to about 4% to 6% of one standard deviation in test scores. In contrast, the literature on Chile based on cross-sectional data had previously found positive effects of about 15% to 20% of one standard deviation.","[Lara, Bernardo; Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Appl Econ, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile.",blara@ing.uchile.cl; amizala@dii.uchile.cl; andrea.repetto@uai.cl,"Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Repetto, Andrea/AAF-7404-2021","Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741",,,,39,25,26,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0162-3737,1935-1062,,EDUC EVAL POLICY AN,Educ.

These compositions produce different learning and social interaction results. The ability to change the group member composition in real time and dynamically enables the leveling up of learning results and improvements in the participants' social relationships. Changes in composition also facilitate the analysis of the best criteria to be used in a determined activity. We propose a face-to-face collaborative environment supported by wireless handhelds that allows for dynamic changes in the composition of groups while an activity is underway. Three different group composition changes were carried out in one environment and the outcomes were compared with another, similar environment where no such group composition changes were performed. The results obtained showed significant improvements, both qualitative and quantitative, in the environment where dynamic grouping was used. Moreover, the criteria for group composition that produce different social interaction outcomes were identified.","Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Dept Sistemas Informac & Auditoria, Santiago 8330015, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Escuela Ingn, Santiago 22, Chile; Univ Chile, Dept Unidad Computac & Anal, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Santiago 833, Chile",,"Zurita, G (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Dept Sistemas Informac & Auditoria, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 8330015, Chile.",gnzurita@facea.uchile.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; rodrigo@facea.uchile.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Zurita, Gustavo/H-3441-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Zurita, Gustavo/0000-0003-0757-1247",,,,34,60,61,0,9,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN",TAIPEI,"129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN",1436-4522,,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

The analysis is based on the discourse on the public/private divide in higher education scrutinising the opinion columns of El Mercurio, a major Chilean newspaper. The authors identify the discursive disappearance of the public university and the reappearance of the 'public' dimension connected to the private sector. The discourse of a 'diverse and mixed' system is accomplished by two discursive devices: (a) Reference to (selected) global trends and (b) Scientific expertise in higher education. The economic and discursive power of El Mercurio enhances the discourses of opinion columnists on the public/private divide. As a result, the concept of the public takes a hybrid turn, detaching itself from the State as its exclusive owner and connecting it to the market.","[Simburger, Elisabeth] Univ Valparaiso, Dept Sociol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Simburger, E (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Dept Sociol, Valparaiso, Chile.",elisabeth.simbuerger@uv.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X","Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies about Political Culture, Memory and Human Rights at the Universidad de Valparaiso","Work on this article was supported by the Chilean National Funding Agency CONICYT and the research grant Fondecyt Regular 1141271, by the PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project BF0003 and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies about Political Culture, Memory and Human Rights at the Universidad de Valparaiso.

To tap into their intuitions about fractions, students were presented with pairs of fractions on the screen for a limited time of 10s. Fraction pairs to be compared were controlled as to whether fractions shared or not a common component (numerator or denominator), as well as whether the greater fraction was the one with greater components or not. Data from about 500 students were processed with a clustering analysis based on these four item types, revealing distinct patterns of answers that we interpret in terms of strategies for answering the task. Half of the sample followed a simple larger-component-larger-fraction strategy as suggested by a congruency-based implementation of the natural number bias, although several clusters showed opposite patterns. These results show that a short, simple task can provide valuable information about students' individual differences in comparing fractions, useful for both research and practice in mathematics education. We discuss implications of these results for research and practice related to mathematics cognition and education.","[Maximiliano Gomez, David] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile; [Maximiliano Gomez, David; Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, DIM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CMM, Ave Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile",,"Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua 2841959, Chile.; Gomez, DM (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago 8330014, Chile.",david.gomez@uoh.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436",CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; CONICYT/PCI Redes [150009],"The authors are grateful to the students, teachers, personnel, and authorities of the five schools and the central administration of the school network that made possible this research; to Benjamin Bossi and Sergio Orellana for their assistance in collecting the data; and to Cristian Reyes and Wim Van Dooren for valuable discussions that helped in shaping this work and manuscript.

These institutions depend to a certain extent on accreditation decisions to obtain indirect public funding. However, the system relies on faculty nominated by conglomerates formed by these same institutions to decide on accreditation. This arrangement creates a potential conflict of interest that can jeopardize the accreditation's legitimacy. We explore this potential bias through an empirical study examining voting behaviour by commissioners of the Chilean National Commission of Accreditation from March 2013 to October 2016. We assess whether commissioners appeared as favouring institutions within their appointing conglomerates. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the region designed to examine the presence of bias in higher education accreditation. Findings indicate commissioners, on average, tended to favour institutions in their appointing conglomerates. We discuss the findings in the broader context of a forthcoming reform of the accreditation system.","[Barroilhet, Agustin] Univ Chile, Law Sch, Pio Nono 1, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Ortiz, Rocio; Quiroga, Bernardo F.; Silva, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile",,"Quiroga, BF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Management, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, RM, Chile.",bfquirog@puc.cl,"Quiroga, Bernardo F./W-2712-2018","Quiroga, Bernardo F./0000-0002-0465-0460",,,,37,2,2,3,5,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0952-8733,1740-3863,,HIGH EDUC POLICY,High Educ.

We show that effectiveness is a fragile attainment that is affected by a variety of external and internal processes. Transformations in the local context (demographic changes and the dynamics of the school market), and educational policies and programs are key external factors. In the internal realm, the role of school administrators, principals, and leadership teams, the organization of pedagogical work, and the school culture modulate the sustainability of educational effectiveness in the long term.","[Bellei, Cristian; Morawietz, Liliana; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Vanni, Xavier] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Morawietz, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",lmorawietz@ciae.uchile.cl,"; Bellei, Cristian/D-9921-2015","Valenzuela, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-0445-968X; Bellei, Cristian/0000-0001-6963-7809",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; Anillo ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS [SOC 1104],Support from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and Anillo Project SOC 1104 is gratefully acknowledged.,,60,5,5,11,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0924-3453,1744-5124,,SCH EFF SCH IMPROV,Sch.

The PD workshop was held in Chile and promoted the use of collaborative problem-solving activities in the classroom, through monthly sessions during the school year. Participant teachers met with a monitor to solve a new problem collaboratively, plan a problem-solving activity for their next lesson, and reflect on their activities from their previous lesson. The study documents the performance of two groups of students when solving non-routine mathematics problems in two similar and non-equal tests consisting of three problems each, before and after the year of application of the workshop. The first group of students was the experimental group with collaborative problem-solving activities, as proposed in the PD workshop. The second group was the control group, composed of students whose teachers followed traditional teaching. In the first part of the paper we present the results of pre- and post-tests in which the students in the experimental group improved their problem-solving performance in a significant way compared with the control group. In the second part, we present a sample of representation strategy used by successful students in both groups and we discuss, in general, student strategies in solving test problems.","[Saadati, Farzaneh; Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile",,"Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Felmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile.",pfelmer@dim.uchile.cl,,"Saadati, Farzaneh/0000-0003-2362-2075","PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003, PAI AFB-170001]; CONICYT/Fondecyt Postdoctoral ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170673]","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions, which improved the paper considerably.

It analyses the theoretical underpinnings, research methods and definitions of identity, providing a critique rather than a summary of the literature. A total of 188 articles from 85 different journals are reviewed in the sample. This review finds support for common complaints of this research area as lacking in definitions of the concept of identity and suggests that the writing in this topic is at times theoretically incompatible. Furthermore, the work in this field may be coming from two distinct paradigms. Identity may be seen as an action and fit within a sociological frame or it may be seen as an acquisition, fitting within a psychological framing. Defining identity as something we do, as an action, and in particular as performative is promoted in this paper. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions in identity research.","[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Darragh, Lisa] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile",,"Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modelling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.",darraghlisa3@gmail.com,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710",CIAE Project from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FB0003],"I wish to acknowledge the Centre for Advanced Research in Education (CIAE, Santiago, Chile), for enabling the writing of this article due to funding from CIAE Project FB0003 from the Associative Research Program of La Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica.",,92,69,71,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-1954,1573-0816,,EDUC STUD MATH,Educ.

Ten years after its implementation, this study looks at the perceived alignments and misalignments between the national accreditation goals and the graduate programs' visions of improvement. By using the concept of loosely coupled systems, we studied eight science and technology master's and doctoral programs at four research-oriented Chilean universities. In total, we conducted 26 interviews, visited all campus sites, and analyzed related documents. The results indicate that the national accreditation system improved academic quality across programs by strengthening the influence of university central administrations and raising faculty productivity standards. In particular, the accreditation meant a push for internationalization, which was welcomed at all institutional levels. However, after a decade, the accreditation system seems misaligned with programs' new improvement efforts, such as the promotion of multidisciplinary work. To some extent, accreditation standards, based on strong disciplinary orientations, penalize a diverse student body and curricular innovation and do not consider the challenges of publishing multidisciplinary research.","[Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Veliz, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Celis, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, FCFM, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile.",scelis@ing.uchile.cl,,"Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608",,,,34,0,0,1,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0952-8733,1740-3863,,HIGH EDUC POLICY,High Educ.

Here, we analyse an alternative strategy that uses text transcripts and a support vector machine classifier. For each one of the 710 videos of mathematics classes from the 2005 Chilean National Teacher Assessment Programme, a single 4-minute slice was selected randomly and manually transcribed. The texts were then rated by two mathematicians and two teachers on the basis of the presence/absence of eight categories of contents and 12 categories of teacher practices. Then for each rater and category a classifier was built using a support vector machine algorithm trained with his/her ratings on a subset of texts. The agreements between the classifiers and the corresponding raters computed for texts belonging to an independent subset were better than the agreements between the raters. Next, we trained classifiers by using ratings created by raters who watched the videos rather than analysing the transcripts. Again, the agreements between classifiers and the raters were satisfactory. Given that class assessment can be an extremely slow, error prone and tedious process, the proposed automatic classifier scheme could be a promising alternative for monitoring classes and building online performance support system of teacher practices.","[Araya, Roberto; Dartnell, Pablo; Soto-Andrade, Jorge] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Araya, R (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Periodista Carrasco 75, Santiago, Chile.",robertoaraya@automind.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Soto-Andrade, Jorge/I-9424-2017","Soto-Andrade, Jorge/0000-0003-1120-2911",,,,0,5,7,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

Through the use of an education production function, this article estimates the effect of variables related to health status, cognitive abilities, and demographic factors of Chilean mothers and children on the children's psychomotor development. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, which provides measures of children's biopsychosocial development through the application of a psychomotor development test (TEPSI) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (TVIP). In turn, the application of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) test to the mother allows an estimation of the role that her cognitive ability plays in the psychomotor development of the child. The results show that health, cognitive, and demographic variables are important factors in a child's biopsychosocial development. In the general model, the measures of cognitive ability have a greater impact than the other variables and, in all specific models, they are significant. Additionally, demographic variables and those related to the family environment have a greater impact than health variables. The child's attendance at preschool has a positive impact on psychomotor development, as measured by the TEPSI, and is even more important than the mother's employment status. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This achievement is measured using performance in standardized reading and mathematics tests. The study also evaluates the effect of a policy that recognizes and increases resources for special educational needs that had not yet been considered and improves education provision protocols for students with SEN. Using administrative data and standardized test scores, we constructed a panel that follows a cohort of students before and after the reform, determining for each individual and year whether the class to which he/she belongs has any students with SEN. Our identification strategy employs panel data with fixed effects at the school, individual, and time levels. Estimates show that, on average, having a peer with SEN in the classroom has a negative effect on the academic performance of students without SEN. However, these effects are small and decrease, or even vanish, once better inclusion policies are in place. These results suggest that the effect on peers is almost totally canceled when more resources are provided and when adequate treatment and support protocols are implemented.","[Contreras, Dante; Brante, Miguel; Espinoza, Sebastian; Zuniga, Isabel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",,"Contreras, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",contreras.dante@gmail.com; mbrante@fen.uchile.cl; seespinoza@fen.uchile.cl; isabel.zunigad@gmail.com,,"Espinoza Rojas, Sebastian/0000-0002-8678-1201","Centre for Social Conflict; Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]","Dante Contreras acknowledges the financial support provided by the Centre for Social Conflict and the Millennium Nucleus of Social Development, which is supported Cohesion Studies by the Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile) (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009).",,27,3,3,0,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0738-0593,1873-4871,,INT J EDUC DEV,Int.

The results show that the 77% of variability observed in the conceptualization of fractions could be attributed to student-level variables, while the remaining 23% would be attributable to school-level variables.

Methodology: an action-research methodology was used with three intervention phases: first, training in the use of graphic organisers of a group of academics who were expert in didactics; second, training of a group of pedagogy students in the methodological use of graphic organisers and, third, instructional design for the IGO's integration in secondary school curricula through these students' on-the-job training. Results: first, the application of a questionnaire on information and communication technology (ICT) skills shows that pedagogy students are good users of office automation applications and Internet but lack preparation for implementing meaningful learning experiences using ICT. Second, after the training process on interactive graphic organisers, each student prepared a curricular design incorporating the IGO as the teaching and learning process articulator. Third, as a result of implementing these curricular designs in schools, the pedagogy students valued this innovation in their didactic practices. Discussion: the findings demonstrate that the adequate integration of technology such as the IGO in the curriculum facilitates not only improvements in the teaching and learning process, from its design to its execution, but also constitutes an interesting didactic resource to develop basic cognitive skills, at the same time enhancing future teachers' ICT skills. Conclusions: the study's results confirm that the IGO's adequate curricular integration substantially improves the didactics of the discipline in which it is incorporated.","[Ponce, Hector R.; Lopez, Mario J.; Labra, Juan E.; Toro, Oscar A.] Univ Santiago Chile, VirtualLab USACH, Santiago, Chile",,"Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Av LB OHiggins 3363 Estn Cent, Santiago, Chile.",hector.ponce@usach.cl,"Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019",,,,,31,1,2,2,23,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,,,REV EDUC,Rev.

Drawing on the concept of coloniality, this paper examines curricular and teaching practices in higher education that aim to decolonise Latin American universities, a particular topic that has been under-investigated. By means of a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis, 40 papers authored by at least one scholar affiliated to a Latin American university were examined. The analysis identified three levels of educational practices (macro, meso and micro) that revolve around the principle of intercultural indigenous education. Further, six essential criteria (cultural, epistemological, relational, ecological, economic, political) in decolonising university education are proposed. The paper concludes by offering insights about decolonising curricula and teaching practices in universities and the ways in which decolonial educational initiatives based on critical border thinking and socialisation of power might transform Latin American universities.","[Guzman Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile",,"Valenzuela, CG (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanities, Arica, Chile.",cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",ANID-FONDECYT Chile [1200633],This work was supported by ANID-FONDECYT Chile: [Grant Number Project number 1200633].,,64,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-2517,1470-1294,,TEACH HIGH EDUC,Teach.

This study considers the historical context which sees Chile adding, to considerable Latin American immigration, selected cohorts of humanitarian refugees from the other side of the world, in this case, Farid, a boy from Baghdad's Palestinian community who arrived with his family in Chile after living two years in the Al-Tanf camp. Based on a qualitative approach, including three ninety-minute interviews, the study considers Farid's pre-, peri- and post-immigration experiences, paying special attention to instances and processes of integration and exclusion in the Chilean school context. The research contributes to understanding the refugee experience in a country broadly unfamiliar with the reception of highly vulnerable people from markedly different cultures. Ultimately, the inclusion of refugees is a challenge and an opportunity for an education system and a society connecting ever more intricately with the wider world.","[Leihy, Pete] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Educ, San Joaquin, Chile; [Arancibia Martini, Hector] Univ Valparaiso, Humanidades & Educ, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Leihy, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile.",peodair@gmail.com,"Martini, HŽctor Arancibia/AAD-2128-2019","Martini, HŽctor Arancibia/0000-0003-2850-1424; Leihy, Peodair/0000-0002-5569-0905",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170397],This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [grant number 3170397].,,43,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-3116,1464-5173,,INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC,Int.

Based on this research, this article aims to identify and analyze the elements that affect the development of leadership identity in female school principals within the Chilean context. This is achieved by working from a biographical-narrative approach, specifically from the life history technique. This analysis emerges from a considerate reflection on the teachings, and personal and professional milestones highlighted in the biogram. Both personally and professionally, a multiplicity of elements is observed in the life history of Maria Eliana, influencing the development of her leadership identity, particularly highlighting her self-recognition as a woman. This identity is oriented towards social justice, based on socio-emotional tools such as care, empathy, and participation; and understands and values the role these elements must take in Chilean education. The case study presents tensions for the Chilean educational system, which must be able to address the complexities that women experience while holding leadership positions, especially when challenged with the perspective that school is an inclusive space of social justice.","[Carrasco, Andrea] Univ Chile, Ctr Estudios Saberes Docentes, Santiago, Chile; [Diaz, Maria E.] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Estudios Saberes Docentes, Santiago, Chile.",ancarrasco@uchile.cl,,,,,,62,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

The online component adapts to teachers' time constraints, requires fewer trained professionals for its implementation, and enhances participants' opportunities to engage in the exploration and visualization of mathematical concepts and ideas. Also, the face-to-face component of this instruction modality allows spontaneous communication and collaborative construction of knowledge in real settings. This paper describes the instructional model of Suma y Sigue, a b-learning professional development program for primary and middle school teachers, which has been designed and implemented in Chile since 2015, aimed at developing mathematical knowledge for teaching. A particular feature of the program is its high-degree of self-directed autonomous online learning. We discuss how contextualized situations are articulated to create a learning environment in which teachers get involved in a progressive construction of multiple components of this knowledge. We also describe the implementation of the program, discussing the effects of scaling in teachers' experiences, and also how the information gathered upon implementation has led to changes in the training of instructors and in the program's instructional design.","[Martinez, Salome; Guinez, Flavio; Zamora, Raul; Bustos, Sofia; Rodriguez, Becky] Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile",,"Martinez, S (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, UMI 2807 CNRS UChile, Santiago, Chile.",samartin@dim.uchile.cl,"Martinez, Salome/F-4878-2013",,Center for Mathematical Modeling [PIA AFB-170001]; Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018; UNESCO-Hamdan Award,"Center for Mathematical Modeling, Grant PIA AFB-170001, Colaboracion Ministerio de Educacion-CMM 2014-2018 and UNESCO-Hamdan Award.",,47,3,3,10,29,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-9690,1863-9704,,ZDM-MATH EDUC,ZDM-Math.

We argue that improving emotional working conditions is necessary to accomplish pedagogical goals, but this dimension has received little attention. This article presents a follow-up study focused on school principals and professionals' emotional and occupational experiences that have worked in the initial two-and-half years of one of the first Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica created in the country. The qualitative analysis of interviews reveals how they make sense of organisational dilemmas while crafting solutions for facing structural shortcomings of new institutions. We understand their extraordinary commitment as 'philanthropic emotional work', driven by genuine care for children and the nation's future. However, in this effort, they also experience labour suffering and work overload, which may compromise their well-being and the long-term accomplishment of this reform's goals. These observations highlight the need for a reflexive improvement of this reform, recognising emotional work as a valuable resource but unsustainable without appropriate institutional support.","[Sanfuentes, Matias] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Sanfuentes, Matias; Garreton, Matias] Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies COES, Santiago, Chile; [Garreton, Matias] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, DesignLab, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan; Diaz, Rocio] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montoya, Claudio] Univ Chile, Saberes Docentes Ctr, Santiago, Chile",,"Sanfuentes, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile.",msanfuentes@unegocios.cl,,,Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) - National Agency for Research and Development (ANID); ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) funded by National Agency for Research and Development (ANID).

The results show that television, with its main audiovisual genres, styles and stereotypes, appears clearly on the teenagers' creations, while the absence of Mapuche signs along the creation process and also into the digital stories seems to be related with two important features of the Chilean educational system: ethnic inequalities and its fierce attachment to neoliberalism.","[Valdivia, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile",,"Valdivia, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Comunicac Imagen, Santiago, Chile.",andrea.valdivia@u.uchile.cl,"Valdivia, Andrea/K-1123-2016",,,,,31,5,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-9884,1743-9892,,LEARN MEDIA TECHNOL,Learn.

Thus, the initiatives of university social responsibility in Spain mostly focused on the management and regulatory approaches, while stressing the own voluntary action and development cooperation transformative approach.","Univ Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile",,"Quezada, RG (corresponding author), Univ Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile.",rgaete@uantof.cl,,"Gaete, Ricardo/0000-0003-2359-2304",,,,40,16,17,1,49,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC,Rev.

To address this problem, researchers have developed models to structure the process. However, we maintain that it is first necessary to understand how students actually search for information online when solving an information problem and compare their behaviours with the available literature. To do this, we collected and analysed the data on a laboratory setting of 41 students while they solved 16 information problems using the internet and expressed aloud what they were thinking whilst solving them. We identified 21 categories of actions, grouped into 9 activity types associated with four information search processes, showing that some of the students' stereotyped search behaviours are in fact conscious decisions based on the requirements of the task and the answers found. The results also show that searching for information on the internet can not only vary depending on the task's requirements, but also on the number of iterations students need to perform to reach an answer. These findings provide some evidence that challenge the assumption that students simply lack the competencies to search for information on the internet; rather, it seems that they show an awareness of different strategies, which they decide to use based on the context and purpose of the task, making their search behaviour more elaborated and complex than is usually portrayed by researchers in the field. Based on this, implications and further research lines are also discussed.","[Hinostroza, J.

Literature suggests that inclusion takes place when barriers are removed, allowing participation. However, scholars agree that teachers still struggle with pedagogical practices in inclusive classrooms. Hansen (Hansen, J.H.2012. Limits to Inclusion. International Journal of Inclusive Education 16 (1): 89-98) contends that teachers establish limits to inclusion in order to manage the level of diversity, arguing that the limits depend on the teacher's understanding of disability. This article examines German secondary school teachers, who reflect on inclusive pedagogical practices and their relationship to learners with disabilities. The analysis shows that most teachers add levels of complexity when constructing the disability's identity. Teachers struggled with the notion of limitation associated with disability and with the discovery of the other, with new learning skills and abilities. Interactions with learners with a disability open new venues to practice inclusion and encourage participation, but this requires a change in practices; yet, not all teachers feel prepared to do that. Teachers offered various rationales on why they applied limits to inclusion; those rationales are rooted in how they interpret disability and their own roles as teachers.","[Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile; [Sagner-Tapia, Johanna] Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile",,"Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile.; Sagner-Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Int Challenges, Temuco, Chile.",johanna.sagner@ufrontera.cl,,,,,,38,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-3116,1464-5173,,INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC,Int.

Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven's (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177-211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator's process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices. Recommendations for the education of PD facilitators in large-scale initiatives are provided.","[Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Catholic Univ Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Santiago, Chile",,"Valoyes-Chavez, L (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Chile.",lvaloyes@uct.cl,,"Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094",ANID/FONDEF [ID14I20338]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; PIA AFB [170001],This work was supported by ANID/FONDEF under Grant #ID14I20338.

Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students' learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community.

Relying on a mixed-method design, we gathered data from individual and group interviews and an online survey conducted with 268 ECEC teachers. Drawn from both a priori and emergent categories, our findings reveal that participants held four paradoxical views on the new System: salary justice versus monetizing of the profession; professional teaching recognition versus counter-pedagogical identity, rigorous evaluation versus inappropiate evaluation instruments, and palpable individual career advancement versus doubtful field development. These paradoxes show that ECEC teachers have a positive global view of the new STPD, despite their perception of its individualistic and counter-ECEC pedagogical nature, suggesting a claim for their right to professional development and decent working conditions, as well as a criticism of the STPD's neoliberal foundation.","[Pardo, Marcela] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Adlerstein, Cynthia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Pardo, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, PeriodistaJose Carracto Tapia 75, Santiago, RM, Chile.",marcelapardo@ciae.uchile.cl,"Adlerstein, Cynthia/AAV-8228-2020","Adlerstein, Cynthia/0000-0001-7174-0100",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761]];  [FB0003],This work was supported by the MINEDUC & UNESCO-OREALC [ADM/2016-0160761];ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003].,,42,1,2,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0957-5146,1472-4421,,EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON,Early Years,OCT 19,2020,40,4-5,,,,,387,399,,10.1080/09575146.2020.1736008,,MAR 2020,13,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,PH5MJ,WOS:000518312700001,,,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,early years,Q4

Considering variable trends in mining, academic institutions with geology programs in Chile were analyzed to provide an evaluation of their current state and projected development across the country. Through the compilation of 5 years of data, a comparison was undertaken in relation to the age of the programs, their respective lifespans, geographic distributions, vacancies, annual entry fees, yearly tuitions, scores on admission tests, curricula, and human resources and infrastructure. The main results indicate the following: most of the new programs are located in or near the Metropolitan Region due to population trends rather than the locations of mines, the actual number of new students may double the total amount of vacancies, the student program fee tends to increase with time and varies between the programs with no apparent relationship to quality, there exists a strong variation in scores needed to enter into the geology programs, and currently there are more individuals studying geology than total graduates. When considering the unfavorable projections for mining in Chile, it is conclusive that this career will not yield the anticipated benefits for graduates unless new, more diverse professional opportunities develop in other sectors.","[Tapia, J.; Tolorza, V.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Duran, P.] Univ Antofagasta, Dept Ingn Minas, Fac Ingn, Antofagasta, Chile; [Poblete, N.] PGS SPA, Huerfanos 1055,Of 503, Santiago, Chile",,"Tapia, J (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Tierra, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.",joseline.tapia@uach.cl,"Tapia, Joseline/AAH-4000-2019","Tapia, Joseline/0000-0002-1516-2622; Tolorza, Violeta/0000-0002-0281-4476",CONICYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [79150070]; FONDECYT - Chilean governmentComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160843],"This work would not be possible without the valuable help of the Group of Education in Geology of the Geological Society of Chile.

Counter stories describe how teachers use their professional experience to confront those mega narratives composed of dominant educational policies that impinge upon their pedagogical practices.

Based on this evidence, we proposed the evolutionary development model (EDM), which aims to produce a cost-effective and sustainable ICT for education (ICT4E) programme in three steps: efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. In each step, one component of the programme is built and validated in real educational settings. Therefore, the resultant ICT4E programme is ready to be replicated across the school system. We also show how the EDM guided the development of a programme based on mobile computer supported collaborative learning, known as Eduinnova.

Several evaluation systems currently in use emphasize educational inputs and, in some cases, mainly compliance with rules and procedures, irrespective of education results (output). If the factors considered in assessing school performance do not correlate well with educational achievement, the incentives vanish. Hence, the importance of emphasizing output and ensuring that if measures are included for inputs and processes, these must line up with educational achievement.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.","[Marques, Maira; Ochoa, Sergio F.; Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia; Gutierrez, Francisco J.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile",,"Marques, M (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile.",mmarques@dcc.uchile.cl; sochoa@dcc.uchile.cl; cecilia@dcc.uchile.cl; frgutier@dcc.uchile.cl,"SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/Q-8247-2019","SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/0000-0001-5347-1664",Project Fondef IDeAComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [IT13I20010]; Conicyt Chile (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional) [2012-21120544],This work was supported by the Project Fondef IDeA under Grant IT13I20010.

In this context, this paper reviews their experience concerning practical robotics courses for children developed since 2000. More than 700 children and 90 school teachers have already attended these robotics courses, and the model is now being implemented in several schools and institutions in Chile. The robotics courses evolved to their present form from ideas developed during the late 1990s, mostly in the United States. Some preliminary assessment data is presented to support this approach. Current projects are also outlined.

In this context, robotics is a very attractive and effective tool for fostering interest in science and technology among children and young people and for attracting them toward engineering. In this article, experience with different robotics-centered outreach activities in the Universidad de Chile (UCH), Santiago, Chile, will be shared. These activities include robotics courses for children, social robots as keynote speakers, mechatronics design courses, and participation in international robotics competitions, which contribute synergistically to the goal of attracting students to UCH's Electrical Engineering (EE) Department. Owing to its novelty, the use of social robots as keynote speakers for schoolchildren will be described in detail. Experimental results that demonstrate how sophisticated social robots can be used to foster the interest of young people in technology will be shown.

These examples are easier to understand and display a richer behavior than the ones commonly used from mechanics, electronics, hydrodynamics, lasers, chemical reactions, and population dynamics. In particular, an electric motor driven by a dynamo can display stationary, Hopf, and codimension-two bifurcations by tuning the driving speed of the dynamo and the electric current in the stator of the electric motor. When the dynamo is driven at constant torque instead of constant rotation rate, chaotic reversals of the generated current and of the angular rotation of the motor are observed. Simple deterministic models are presented which capture the observed dynamical regimes.

In particular, we focus the work on the realization of phase-only gratings and phase-only spiral phases for the generation of vortex beams, beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). Despite the extensive activity in this field, its experimental implementation for educational purposes is limited because it requires the use of very expensive high-resolution liquid-crystal on silicon (LCOS) SLMs. Here, we show that a low-cost experimental implementation can be done with older TNLC technology. However, these devices, intended for display applications, exhibit rather limited optical phase modulation properties in comparison with modern LCOS devices, such as a very low range of phase modulation and a general coupled intensity modulation.

As examples, we include one continuous phaseonly configuration useful for reproducing the optimal triplicator phase grating, and a binary p-phase modulation. We include experiments with the realization of different phase diffraction gratings, and their combination with spiral phase patterns and lens functions to generate a variety of vortex beams.","[Cofre, Aaron; Moreno, Ignacio] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Ciencia Mat Opt & Tecnol Elect, E-03202 Elche, Spain; [Garcia-Martinez, Pascuala] Univ Valencia, Dept Opt, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain; [Vargas, Asticio] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Fis, Temuco, Chile",,"Garcia-Martinez, P (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Opt, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain.",pascuala.garcia@uv.es,"Garc’a-Mart’nez, Pascuala/E-3603-2012; Vargas, Asticio/H-9123-2015","Garc’a-Mart’nez, Pascuala/0000-0002-8537-281X; Moreno, Ignacio/0000-0002-1550-0601","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of SpainSpanish Government; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission [FIS2015-66328-C3-3-R]; Generalitat Valenciana, Santiago Grisolia ProgramGeneralitat Valenciana [2015/073]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151290]","We acknowledge financial support from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain and FEDER funds (grant ref.: FIS2015-66328-C3-3-R).

Using the properties of the rotation matrix and associated operators, we show that it is possible to find an exact analytical solution to a number of problems where the differential equation of motion depends on the velocity. First, we apply our method to the well-known cases of a particle under the influence of the Lorentz force and Coriolis force, providing the complete analytical solution in each case for the motion of the particle in three dimensions. We also show that the complete solution can be obtained when the centrifugal force is included, showing the applicability to cases where there is simultaneous dependence on the position and velocity. This method, which is not currently discussed in a typical course in elementary mechanics, provides an alternative approach to the traditional methods that are used to solve these types of problems.

In particular, the information imparted is related to territorial information on several relevant disciplines like Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). This is done in a context of digital information about the environment of Santiago de Chile. The research focuses on two main areas, of which the first is the territorial delimitation, in the thematic context of the study area, in order to carry out the design of an MPN-AR application. This includes defining the architecture, functionality, user interface and implementation of the application. A second step deals with the empirical verification of the results produce by the various modes of operation of the application, as well as the comprehensibility and effectiveness of the model. This is done by means of an MPN-AR application, which has been created in the context of mobile learning and ubiquitous learning as applied to territorial or environments systems.

In previous research, concept keyboards (CK) were successfully used to implement a software system supporting the learning of classical algorithms, like QuickSort and Dijkstra's algorithm, among others. Traditional visualization software normally offers the learner an animated representation of the algorithm with the possibility of controlling the execution of the right steps, giving the learner a more or less passive role. Concept keyboards allow the learner to control the execution of the algorithm by deciding which function should be performed when. Four cryptographic protocols were implemented and tested (Wide Mouth Frog, Feige-Fiat-Shamir, Needham-Schroeder and Kerberos V).

This study consisted of two phases starting with designing a chemistry education for the sustainable development-based learning environment of reaction kinetics, followed by a case study in which students' perceptions toward learning chemistry by solving a real environmental problem using digital resources, spreadsheets, and an active learning environment, were explored. First, we designed a Socio-Scientific Environmental Chemistry module centered on the sorption kinetic processes of herbicides in volcanic ash derived soils (VADS) and their potential to pollute groundwater. The objective of the learning module was to contribute to the development of sustainability skills, to promote learning of contextualized chemistry knowledge, and to develop scientific skills. This module employs spreadsheets as computational tools in chemistry to model real sorption kinetic data of herbicides in VADS. The learning module was designed for one section of two Analytical Chemistry courses and one Physical Chemistry course of an undergraduate chemistry teacher-training program. After the design phase, the learning module was implemented in each course, and students' perceptions were gathered using the focus group technique. The sample was of 22 students distributed into three focus groups. The data collected were analyzed and categorized through qualitative content analysis using the Technological Pedagogical Science Knowledge (TPASK) framework. On the basis of our findings, the students acquired contextualized chemistry knowledge and develop skills and knowledge related to using digital resources and spreadsheets in a scientific context. Besides, the preservice chemistry teachers' knowledge of pedagogy allowed them to develop some elements of their pedagogical science knowledge and TPASK. This case study shows that the problem-based learning approach offers great potential in supporting a learning environment suitable to working with spreadsheets to solve real-environment problems in chemistry education.","[Caceres-Jensen, Lizethly; Rodriguez-Becerra, Jorge; Jorquera-Moreno, Barbara; Druker-Ibanez, Sofia; Hernandez-Ramos, Jose] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Lab Quim Mat, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Escudey, Mauricio] CEDENNA, Ctr Dev Nanosci & Nanotechnol, Santiago 9170124, Chile; [Diaz-Arce, Tatiana] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Philosophy & Educ, Dept Special Educ, Santiago 7760197, Chile; [Pernaa, Johannes; Aksela, Maija] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Unit Chem Teacher Educ, Helsinki 00014, Finland",,"Caceres-Jensen, L (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Phys & Analyt Chem Lab PachemLab, Dept Chem,Doctorate Educ Program, Santiago 7760197, Chile.",lyzethly.caceres@umce.cl,"C‡ceres-Jensen, Lizethly/ABA-8239-2021; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/F-8714-2017","C‡ceres-Jensen, Lizethly/0000-0002-5903-7356; BECERRA, JORGE EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ/0000-0003-1496-8410; Pernaa, Johannes/0000-0003-1735-5767; Hernandez Ramos, Jose/0000-0001-8871-8495; Aksela, Maija Katariina/0000-0002-9552-248X","Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile [DIUMCE FGI 36-17, FGI-46-18]; CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 11110421, CEDENNA FB-0807]","This work was supported through DIUMCE FGI 36-17 and FGI-46-18 (Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educacion, Chile), FONDECYT 11110421 (CONICYT, Chile), CEDENNA FB-0807 (CONICYT, Chile).

We discuss the various experimental and theoretical aspects of this classic problem. Careful time-resolved force measurements allow us to determine the differences between the idealized problem and its implementation in the laboratory. We observe that, in spite of the upward force exerted by the pan on the chain, the free end at the top falls faster than a freely falling body. Because a real chain exhibits a finite minimum radius of curvature, the contact at the bottom results in a tensional force, which pulls the falling part downward.

In an effort to balance the rigorous academic technical requirements of an engineering degree, entrepreneurship programs leverage both curricular and co-curricular programming, offering students different paths to entrepreneurship development. However, little is known about the distribution of these opportunities amongst different groups of students. The purpose of this investigation is to examine whether the pathways to entrepreneurship education are influenced by student characteristics. Institution and participation data of 1,018 undergraduate students were collected from an entrepreneurship program anchored in a large, Midwest, public research university, college of engineering, center for entrepreneurship. Logistic regressions were used to examine the differences and similarities between students enrolling an entrepreneurship curricular program and their participation in co-curricular activities. Our data indicates that gender, nationality, and grade point average (GPA) are key factors in determining the type of entrepreneurship participation students choose to pursue in the university environment. We also found evidence of the curricular program acting as a gateway to engagement with entrepreneurship beyond the classroom. These data suggest that entrepreneurship programs should be cognizant of the influencers as well as the student pathways when developing programs to attract a diverse student base.","[Huang-Saad, Aileen] Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Huang-Saad, Aileen] Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Ctr Entrepreneurship, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Sch Engn & Sci, Beauchef 850, Santiago 8370448, Chile",,"Huang-Saad, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Huang-Saad, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Coll Engn, Ctr Entrepreneurship, 1101 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aileenhs@umich.edu; scelis@ing.uchile.cl,"Huang-Saad, Aileen/AAA-7786-2020","Huang-Saad, Aileen/0000-0002-0300-8425; Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608",,,,53,8,9,1,21,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Mothers and children were surveyed in their homes or at schools in Temuco, Chile. Participants: A total of 300 mothers (average age, 41.6 years) and their adolescent children (average age, 13.2 years; 48.7% female). Main Outcome Measures: Maternal feeding practices using the abbreviated Family Food Behavior Survey (AFFBS),life satisfaction, food-related and family life satisfaction, diet quality, and eating habits. Analysis: Principal component factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to verify Family Food Behavior Survey components in mother and adolescent subsamples. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify profiles. Results: Three AFFBS components were detected: maternal control of child snacking behavior, maternal presence during eating, and child involvement in food consumption. Cluster analysis identified 3 mother-adolescent dyad profiles with different food-related parenting practices (P <= .001), mother (P <= .05) and child (P <= .001) diet quality, frequency of shared family meals (P <= .001), and mother (P <= .001) and child (P <= .05) life satisfaction levels. Conclusions and Implications: Results indicated that maternal well-being increased with an increased frequency of shared mealtime. Significantly, in contrast to the findings of previous studies, greater control over child eating habits was shown to affect adolescent well-being positively. These findings, among others, may contribute to the development of strategies for improving diet quality, overall well-being, and wellbeing in the food and family domains for all family members.","[Schnettler, Berta] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Schnettler, Berta; Denegri, Marianela; Hueche, Clementina] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Excelencia Psicol Econ & Consumo, Nucleo Cient & Tecnol Ciencias Sociales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Grunert, Klaus G.] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark; [Lobos, German] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile; [Miranda-Zapata, Edgardo] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Cient & Tecnol Ciencias Sociales, LICSA, Temuco, Chile; [Denegri, Marianela] Univ La Frontera, Fac Educ Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Temuco, Chile",,"Schnettler, B (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, POB 54-D, Temuco, Chile.",berta.schnettler@ufrontera.cl,"LOBOS, GERMAN/V-8128-2019; Denegri, Marianela/AAU-9898-2021; Zapata, Edgardo Miranda/AAO-3318-2020","LOBOS, GERMAN/0000-0002-6155-4870; Miranda-Zapata, Edgardo/0000-0003-3359-3052","Conicyt, Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160005]","This work was supported by Conicyt, Fondecyt Project No. 1160005.",,52,17,17,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1499-4046,1878-2620,,J NUTR EDUC BEHAV,J.

Developing quality standards and measuring learning levels can be difficult enough from campus to campus within a particular country. However, exporting and adapting such standards across countries and educational traditions and cultures is even more challenging. The present paper describes the portability of one system of assessment developed at a U.S. institution as applied to two engineering faculties in Chile. The process followed during the initial training and development provides some good insights into how assessment and quality improvement processes can be quickly implemented. However, the implementation required cultural shifts in how the program approached, and administrators and faculty thought about, assessment for quality improvement. The experience in Chile provides some lessons on the opportunities and potential pitfalls of carrying out such a process in other countries and programs.","[Sheahan, T.

Additionally, to clinical use, digital technology is focused on the education and training of students. The objective of this study was to show the potential benefit of the use of digital CAD / CAM technology and assisted training software in the evaluation and improvement of student skills in preclinical and clinical environments. Materials and Methods 30 models of dental preparations were digitalised and analysed by PrepCheck software, after that was used the PrepCheck Report tool, gathering the results of the analysis in an automatically created report and containing the following parameters: analysis of the conicity, distance between a preparation and the opposing jaw, analysis of the type of preparation, quality of the margin and total occlusal convergence. Results The use of the PrepCheck Pro 2.1 software makes evident the errors made by the students during the biomechanical preparation, since they generally change the inclination, in order to have less difficulties to comply with the parameters established in the preparations. Regarding the evaluated parameters for anterior and posterior fixed prosthesis) such as: 'Conicity', 'Type of preparation' and 'Distance to the antagonist', the preparations, in their majority, were classified within the tolerance range with of 50-60%, 80-93% and 53-67%, respectively. Conclusion This pilot study demonstrated the benefits of using software and CAD/CAM technology in both preclinical and clinical environments for teaching and learning. Its use on preclinical environments allows the student observe qualitatively and quantitatively a preparation flaws when compared to a master's preparation. Lastly, the ease of visualising errors associated with magnification would allow students to improve their skills.","[Jorquera, Gilbert; Pablo Sanchez, Juan; Sampaio, Camila S.; Atria, Pablo] Univ Andes, Coll Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Santiago, Chile; [Fernandez, Eduardo] Univ Chile, Fac Dent, Restorat Dent Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Fernandez, Eduardo] Univ Autonoma Chile, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Santiago, Chile",,"Fernandez, E (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dent Sch, Dept Restorat Dent, Sergio Livingstone Pohlhammer 943, Santiago, Chile.",edofdez@yahoo.com,"FERNANDEZ, EDUARDO/I-5368-2012","FERNANDEZ, EDUARDO/0000-0002-2616-1510",,,,20,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Research has generally focused on a single type of loss, with only a handful of studies exploring the accumulation of losses in old age and examining which and how many losses are experienced, and how intense they are. The lack of instruments that reflect the diversity of the losses that individuals can sustain at this stage of life makes it difficult to accumulate knowledge in this field, since it is not possible to characterize this experience or establish associations with other significant variables. Based on a prior categorization of six types of losses, developed upon the basis of reports by older adults, we sought to construct and validate a Scale of Losses Experienced in Old Age (SLO). This scale underwent semantic validation, followed by content validation. Afterward, for the construct validation process, it was administered to a pilot sample of 249 middle-income community-dwelling older adults. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded adequate values (RMSEA = 0.060, CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.961, SRMR = 0.075), with internal consistency also being suitable (ordinal alpha = 0.856). These values warrant recommending the use of the SLO, since it offers a view of losses in old age that is both broad and detailed, thus facilitating the production of cumulative and comparable knowledge in the field of psychogerontology while also making it possible to establish interdisciplinary connections.","[Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Gerosci Ctr Brain Hlth & Metab GERO, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela; Assar, Rodrigo; Wenk, Elisabeth; Villagra, Roque; Lillo, Patricia; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Mayor, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile; [Assar, Rodrigo; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Inst Biomed Sci ICBM, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Arnold-Cathalifaud, Marcelo] Univ Chile, Dept Anthropol, Fac Social Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neuropsychol & Clin Neurosci Lab Lannec, Physiopathol Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Villagra, Roque; Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, East Neurosci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Hosp Salvador, Dept Neurol, Memory & Neuropsychiat Clin CMYN, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Lillo, Patricia] Univ Chile, South Neurol Dept, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile; [Slachevsky, Andrea] Univ Desarrollo, Dept Med, Neurol Serv, Clin Alemana, Santiago, Chile; [Thumala-Dockendorff, Daniela] Univ Chile, Interuniv Ctr Hlth Aging, Santiago, Chile",,"Thumala-Dockendorff, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Santiago, Chile.",dthumala@uchile.cl,"Slachevsky, Andrea/P-4039-2014","Slachevsky, Andrea/0000-0001-6285-3189",MULTI-PARTNER CONSORTIUM TO EXPAND DEMENTIA RESEARCH IN LATIN AMERICA (ReDLat) - National Institutes of Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R01AG057234]; Alzheimer's AssociationAlzheimer's Association [SG-20-725707-ReDLat]; Rainwater Foundation; Global Brain Health Institute; GBHI;  [ANID/FONDAP/15150012];  [ANID/Fondecyt/1191726],"This work was supported by ANID/FONDAP/15150012.

This is an approach that arises from contemporary conceptions about art, which is an intrinsic relationship between the artwork and the creative and critical character towards representation systems. Emphasising the definition of complex thinking proposed by Mathew Lipman serves as a guiding axis to try to establish the cognitive processes that compose it. Among the main findings is that the development of complex thinking and cognition occurs through action and interaction with the environment, thus linking to the notions of 'situated competence' and the 'complex approach to competences'. By including cognitive and metacognitive processes, it allows us to postulate complex thinking as metacompetence. In addition, it is proposed that the use of learning methodologies (under a competence-based approach) could contribute to an art education where students produce artistic works that involve critical, creative processes or divergent results. It is also necessary that both the curriculum and the teachers encourage an expanded and interdisciplinary vision, understanding that art is not circumscribed to a specific discipline.","[Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile; [Silva Pacheco, Cristian] Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile",,"Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Human Sci, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Educ Competence, Talca, Chile.; Pacheco, CS (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Inst Humanities, Lircay S-N, Talca 747721, Chile.",crsilvap@utalca.cl,,,"PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca","This study was supported by PIA Cognitive Sciences, Center for Research in Cognitive Sciences, PhD in Human Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Institute of Humanistic Studies, University of Talca.",,36,3,3,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1476-8062,1476-8070,,INT J ART DES EDUC,Int.

We use the revealed preferences of students for college major choice by taking advantage of Chile's Centralized Admission System, and estimate a nested logit model to predict the first preference of applicants. We find that males apply to selective programs even when they are marginal candidates, while equally qualified female candidates tend to apply less often to these programs. Using counterfactual exercises, we conclude that to successfully address the gender gap, along with promoting females' participation in STEM careers, we must increase males' willingness to consider non-STEM fields. Closing the gender gap does not imply a loss in terms of talent distribution by area of knowledge.","[Bordon, Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, COES, Santiago, Chile; [Bordon, Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, DESOC, Santiago, Chile; [Canals, Catalina; Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, CIAE, Santiago, Chile.; Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile.",pbordon@uahurtado.cl; catalina.canals@ciae.uchile.cl; amizala@uchile.cl,"Canals, Catalina/AAR-1801-2021; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013","Canals, Catalina/0000-0002-9940-1052; Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677","FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [N1140834]; ANID/PIA/Basal Project [FB0003]; Millennium Nucleus on Social Development; supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC at the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Universidad de Chile [ECM-02];  [ANID/FONDAP/15130009];  [ANID/Doctorado Nacional/2017-21170290]","Alejandra Mizala acknowledges financial support from FONDECYT Project N1140834 and from ANID/PIA/Basal Project FB0003.; Paola Bordon acknowledges support from ANID/FONDAP/15130009 and the Millennium Nucleus on Social Development.; Catalina Canals acknowledges support from ANID/PIA/Basal Project FB0003 and ANID/Doctorado Nacional/2017-21170290.; This research was also partially supported by the supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC (ECM-02) at the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Universidad de Chile.",,40,3,3,10,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

The first topic is a Treasury bill auction experiment in which students have an opportunity to participate directly. The results from a class of 14 money and banking students are used to explain how an instructor might conduct such an experiment in the classroom. Relatively simple algebraic models are also developed for 2 types of stock market transactions: short selling and margin buying. Three analytical exercises are presented with complete solutions to demonstrate how an instructor might assign related problems for students. These experiments and models give students a lasting understanding of a number of rarely discussed topics in money and banking courses.,"Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Saros, DE (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",dan.saros@valpo.edu,,,,,,6,1,1,0,0,HELDREF PUBLICATIONS,WASHINGTON,"1319 EIGHTEENTH ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-1802 USA",0022-0485,,,J ECON EDUC,J.

On a conceptual level, it outlines a model for understanding how TV operates as a social mediator in the event of natural disasters, and at the practical level, it recommends measures that can be used to optimize the role of TV and its ideal social function in contexts of crisis. This model views TV intervention as both self-centered, that is, driven by its reproduction as a media consumption company; and socially-centered, designed to respond swiftly and accurately to the social requirements that emerge in crisis situations. The suggested model is to be contrasted with the results of a research study conducted by the National TV Council of Chile that explored the role of TV broadcasting after the earthquake in February 2010. According to the results of the study, audiences value the amount of information broadcasted by TV networks but perceive that the predominance of its self-centered function creates a problem: the logic of the 'spectacle' is prevalent and exacerbates the audience's emotions. The primary purpose of this paper is to develop a strategy to recommend how TV and its associate services can respond to a crisis situation while respecting the tragedy of natural disasters.","[Dolores Souza, Ma] Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile; [Dolores Souza, Ma] Programa Televis Educ Novasur Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Martinez, Victor] Univ Chile, Dept Psicol, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile",,"Souza, MD (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Televis Chile, Dept Estudios, Santiago, Chile.",msouza@cntv.cl; vimartin@vtr.net,,,,,,7,5,5,0,13,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2011,18,36,,,,,69,76,,10.3916/C36-2011-02-07,,,8,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,716RY,WOS:000286992400009,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Estatal,comunicar,Q1

Considering the first and last time they were included in a test, 50 (25%) increased their difficulty, 39 (20%) diminished it, and 108 (55%) remained unchanged. The correlation coefficient between the percentage of students that answered correctly each question the first and last time they were used was 0.51 (p < 0.001).

In particular, the previous literature has compared student effort under relative and absolute grading systems, but the results are mixed and the implications of the models have not been empirically tested. In this paper, I build a model where students maximize their utility by choosing effort. I investigate how student effort changes when there is a change in the grading system from absolute grading to relative grading. I use a unique dataset from college students in Chile who faced a change in the grading system to test the implications of my model. My model predicts that, for low levels of uncertainty, low-ability students exert less effort with absolute grading, and high-ability students exert more effort with absolute grading. The data confirm that there is a change in the distribution of effort.","[Paredes, Valentina] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile",,"Paredes, V (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago, Chile.",vparedes@fen.uchile.cl,,,"CEPPE, project Conicyt [CIE-01-4]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PAI 7912010032]","I would like to thank CEPPE, project CIE-01-4 Conicyt, for providing financial support.

Between 2002 and 2011 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1282 schools closed -roughly one-tenth of the current stock- and 2350 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which contains individual students' academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 49 and 68% (1.8 and 2.5 percentage points). Also, school exit implies between 3.9 and 4.4 percentage points increase in the probability of grade retention in fifth grade.","[Grau, Nicolas; Hojman, Daniel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile",,"Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.; Mizala, A (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.",amizala@dii.uchile.cl,"Hojman, Daniel A/N-4178-2015; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013","Hojman, Daniel A/0000-0001-7768-0065; Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677",Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; PIA-CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003],"We thank the Chilean Ministry of Education for providing the data.

There is scarce scientific evidence in Latin America, and in Chile this format has been used in television programs, and only recently in movies. The objective of this research is to study the influence of placement in movies on explicit memory (unaided recall and brand awareness) and implicit memory (purchase intention) through the implementation of an experiment performed on a sample of 205 Chilean college students, according to the different types of placement in movies: brands as part of the background, used by a main character, and connected with the plot. The results indicate that the higher the degree of integration of the brand with the plot of the film, the higher the probability of stimulating the explicit memory of participants and thereby unaided recall and brand awareness, providing empirical evidence regarding the learning of consumer behavior through placement as a communication tool.","[Valenzuela-Fernandez, Leslier; Martinez-Troncoso, Carolina; Yanez-Wieland, Felipe] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",,"Valenzuela-Fernandez, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.",lvalenzuela@unegocios.cl; cmartinezt@uft.cl; fyanezw@fen.uchile.cl,,"Martinez Troncoso, Carolina Andrea/0000-0001-8467-4317",,,,39,7,7,1,19,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN 1,2015,22,44,,,,,169,176,,10.3916/C44-2015-18,,,8,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,AX8KR,WOS:000347158900018,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2022-04-06,Estatal,comunicar,Q1

In 2011, Chile experienced massive mobilizations for seven months. These were perhaps the most important social protests in Chile's recent history, where young people played a leading role in the discussion over education. During these events, Facebook was one of the digital social networks most widely used by the mobilized organizations.

However, most of the content published on this Facebook page was produced by traditional media, showing that conventional communication strategies of social movements are interrelated with new innovative practices. Therefore, this article rejects technological determinism, because it does not recognize the complex characteristics of student and youth movements.","Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile",,"Cabalin, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Commun & Image, Santiago, Chile.",ccabalin@uchile.cl,"Cabalin, Cristian/B-5977-2014","Cabalin, Cristian/0000-0003-1327-1478",,,,34,47,50,3,74,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL 1,2014,22,43,,,,,25,33,,10.3916/C43-2014-02,,,9,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,AK0UB,WOS:000338130200004,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,2022-04-06,Estatal,comunicar,Q1

Evidence from GPA-based university admission in Chile,economics of education review,,,English,Article,,,,,,College admissions; Rankings; Incentives; Moral hazard,AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION,"The use of students' within-school grade point average (GPA) ranking has emerged as a means to increase admission rates of both segregated minorities and high-performance individuals. Based on that idea, Chile's centralized university admission system introduced, in 2012, a GPA-ranking score variable. In contrast to other ranking-based criteria, the Chilean version ostensibly avoids classmate competition by basing scores on past cohorts' GPAs. Also, the GPA-ranking is similar to an added bonus to the GPA score, and it does not replace the national admission exam. Such design incentivizes both academic effort and GPA inflation. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the Chilean reform on GPA and achievement. Our results, based on difference-in-differences and simulated instruments methods, suggest that: (i) GPA increased across the entire distribution of students; (ii) GPA increases were larger in schools where the new variable presented greater incentives; and (iii) GPA increases were unrelated to improvements in achievement. We interpret the results as evidence that the Chilean ranking variable caused GPA inflation rather than increased learning.","[Fajnzylber, Eduardo; Leon, Tomas] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile",,"Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santa Elena 2222, Santiago, Chile.",eduardo.fajnzylber@uai.cl; blara@utalca.cl,,"Lara Escalona, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741",,,,16,3,3,2,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

I build a rank-order tournament model where high school students decide their level of effort and whether or not to take the college admissions test, considering how those decisions affect their future university admissions chances. Using administrative Chilean data for the 2009 college admissions process, I structurally estimate the parameters of the model. Two affirmative action policies are simulated: (a) SES-quota system, which imposes the population's socioeconomic group (SES) distribution for each university; (b) increasing the weight of high school GPA in the admission final score. These simulations support the claim that affirmative action in college admission may boost the amount of academic effort exerted by high school students. I also find that while increasing the weight of high school GPA is more effective in boosting students' academic effort in high school, the SES-quota system is more efficient in allocating the best students to the best universities.","[Grau, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile",,"Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago 1504, Chile.",ngrau@fen.uchile.cl,,,Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009],"I thank Diego Amador, Sina Ates, Garth Baughman, Flavio Cunha, Hanming Fang, Tzuo Hann Law, Andres Hojman, Daniel Hojman, Zehao Hu, Tomas Rau, Minchul Shin, Petra Todd, Juan Pablo Torres-Martinez and Kenneth I.

This is done with respect to 2 different types of countries (Finland and Chile) to include cultural effect. We use questionnaire-based data and pupils' drawings of their mathematics class to find out about their individual and interindividual experiences. By using mixed data, we are not only getting a wider picture of pupils' affect but we can also avoid the most typical errors made in the cross-cultural comparisons as the pupils' own voice is strengthened.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate advice-seeking patterns around the issue of supporting the learning and wellbeing of vulnerable students, among professional staff in six English secondary schools. The paper focuses on investigating variation in advice-seeking patterns among schools, exploring the association between these patterns and staff perceptions of the school climate for collaboration, and examining how these informal advice-seeking patterns relate to formal support arrangements in the schools. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach that combined findings from social network analysis with in-depth interviews was used. Findings It was found that advice-seeking patterns among staff vary substantively, even among similar schools. Furthermore, schools with more cohesive and reciprocal advice networks also showed a stronger climate for collaboration (i.e. mutual respect and distributed leadership). Also, formal organizational structures and informal advice-seeking structures showed coherence in the sample, as formally designated leaders, such as the Headteacher and the Special Educational Needs Coordinators, were generally highly central to their schools' advice network. Originality/value This study advances the field as there is little research that examines the social networks of educators in England, and no previous studies that explore teacher advice-seeking networks in relation to supporting vulnerable students, internationally.","[Ortega, Lorena] Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Thompson, Ian; Daniels, Harry] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England",,"Ortega, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, IE, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",lorena.ortega@ciae.uchile.cl,"Ortega, Lorena/P-1879-2018","Ortega, Lorena/0000-0002-6471-0277",Oxford University John Fell Research Fund [EPD07450]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003],This work was funded by Oxford University John Fell Research Fund EPD07450.

For this, a quasi-experimental experiment was designed, and a quantitative methodology was used through pretest and posttest in a control and experimental group in which the effectiveness of two teaching models was compared, one more traditional based on exercises written on paper and another based on interaction with a chatbot. Subsequently, the perception of the experimental group in an academic forum about the educational use of the chatbot was analyzed through text mining with tests of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), pairwise distance matrix and bigrams. The quantitative results showed that the students in the experimental group substantially improved the results compared to the students with a more traditional methodology (experimental group / mean: 32.1346 / control group / mean: 28.4706). Punctuation correctness has been improved mainly in the usage of comma, colon and periods in different syntactic patterns. Furthermore, the perception of the students in the experimental group showed that they positively value chatbots in their teaching-learning process in three dimensions: greater support and companionship in the learning process, as they perceive greater interactivity due to their conversational nature; greater feedback and interaction compared to the more traditional methodology and, lastly, they especially value the ease of use and the possibility of interacting and learning anywhere and anytime.","[Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Vazquez-Cano, Esteban] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Mengual-Andres, Santiago] Univ Valencia, Sch Philosophy & Educ, Dept Comparat Educ & Hist Educ, Valencia, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Pablo Olavide, Fac Social Sci, Dept Educ & Social Psychol, Seville, Spain; [Lopez-Meneses, Eloy] Univ Atacama, IICSE, Dir Ext & Relac Int, Atacama, Chile",,"Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Dept Didact, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Vazquez-Cano, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Fac Educ, Sch Org, C Juan del Rosal 14, Madrid 28040, Spain.",evazquez@edu.uned.es,"L—pez-Meneses, E./G-1307-2011; Mengual-AndrŽs, Santiago/E-8045-2011","L—pez-Meneses, E./0000-0003-0741-5367; Mengual-AndrŽs, Santiago/0000-0002-1588-9741; Vazquez-Cano, Esteban/0000-0002-6694-7948","I + D + I Project; FEDER (European Regional Development Fund)European Commission [RTI2018-099764-B-100]; Ministry of Science, Innovation","This research has been developed with the support of the I + D + I Project entitled: ``Gamification and ubiquitous learning in Primary Education.

International partnership has been an essential part of these strategies. Partnerships help institutions in creating practices that are costly, as well as enhancing reputation by partnering with prestigious schools. Moreover, different spectrums of partnerships require varying degrees of commitment. Noting that the motivation for and engagement in partnerships is particularly strong in business, and the region of Latin America as well as Asia and Oceania, this study attempts to depict how institutions engage internationalisation, revealed as the exchange network and dual degree network of the 20 best MBA programmes in the two regions. Employing social network analysis, we found that schools have different levels of engagement in building partnerships and the region and reputation of schools matter for partnerships. Top-ranked MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners and have a higher level of popularity in the exchange network. The dual degree network was more restricted in terms of the number, country, and prestige. Asian and Oceanian MBA programmes tend to have more exchange partners but are less likely to engage in dual degree partnerships, compared to the Latin American MBA programmes. Some institutions focus their dual degree network on a particular region. As higher education institutions actively engage in various types of collaborations, the findings provide meaningful implications for understanding the patterns of international partnership among higher education institutions.","[Kim, Jeongeun] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, FCFM, Sch Sci & Engn, Beauchef 850, Santiago 8370448, Chile",,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, 1050 S Forest Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"Kim, Jeongeun/N-9390-2019","Kim, Jeongeun/0000-0002-3736-1446; Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608",,,,83,3,3,3,53,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0952-8733,1740-3863,,HIGH EDUC POLICY,High Educ.

Findings show that all participants converged on actions to promote changes in: staffing, redesigning the organisation, and managing instruction. The quality of the actions, however, differed by type of school, highlighting the importance of defining policies for strengthening school leadership that take into account differences among schools. Induction will provide needed support at the individual level, but it might be insufficient support if other measures at the district level fail to create conditions, such as staffing, so the arrival of a new principal is indeed an opportunity to reverse a downward trajectory of an ineffective, high-poverty school.","[Galdames, Sergio] UCL Inst Educ, Educ Leadership, London, England; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Campos, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Veronica Leiva, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; galdames, sergio/P-5604-2019","galdames, sergio/0000-0001-6836-7595; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848; Leiva Guerrero, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-7641-0087",FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140906]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 0003],"The authors are grateful for the financial support provided, at different stages of the study, by FONDECYT Grant # 1140906 and by CONICYT FB 0003.

An Augmented Reality app to analyze digital current (DC) in resistive circuits was developed was developed to enhance students' understanding of electricity. The app allows the manipulation of circuit elements, computes the voltage and amperage values using the loop method by applying Kirchhoff's voltage law. A model with the following variables was theoretically conceived: subjective norms, technology optimism, technology innovativeness, attitude toward using and behavioral intention to use. The study considered a sample of 173 engineering students and was carried out using structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that subjective norms have a positive effect on technology optimism and technology innovativeness. Further, attitude toward using was found to depend on a medium range of students' characteristics, such as technology optimism and technology innovativeness. The results suggest that the academic environment can influence a student's beliefs concerning new technologies. Understanding how the educational environment can affect students' attitudes toward the use of new technologies can help higher education institutions establish policies for their adoption to facilitate the learning process.","[Alvarez-Marin, Alejandro] Univ La Serena, Dept Ingn Ind, Benavente 980, La Serena 1720170, Chile; [Velazquez-Iturbide, J.

The MOBAK battery is designed to assess basic motor competencies in primary education. It differentiates by the stage in the curriculum, and proposes a two-factor structure corresponding to the basic motor competencies of object movement and self-movement. This study has three objectives: to determine the construct validity of three test instruments of the MOBAK battery for assessing motor competencies; to determine how gender, BMI, and age covariates relate to motor competencies; and to examine the level of basic motor competencies of primary school children in Chile. A total of 1,785 children (45.7% girls) were assessed, divided into 1st and 2nd grade (MOBAK 1-2; 559 children; 50.6 % girls), 3rd and 4th grade (MOBAK 3-4; 496 children, 39.3 % girls), and 5th and 6th grade (MOBAK 5-6; 730 children, 46.3 % girls). The construct validity of each section was analysed using the confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA). The results confirm the two-factor structure in all sections of the MOBAK battery, they confirm the relationship between motor competencies and the covariates gender, BMI, and age, and they show that Chilean primary school children have low levels of motor competence, especially in 5th and 6th grade. The MOBAK battery is a suitable instrument for the assessment of basic motor competencies in primary education and is a diagnostic and monitoring tool for pedagogical practices and educational research.","[Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Herrmann, Christian] Zurich Univ Teacher Educ, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Carcamo-Oyarzun, J (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile.",jaime.carcamo@ufrontera.cl; christian.herrmann@phzh.ch,"Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime/N-2362-2015","Carcamo-Oyarzun, Jaime/0000-0002-7536-8788","Chile's Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) (National Commission for Scientific Research and Technology), through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (National Fund for Scientific and Technological De [11170525]","This work received funding from Chile's Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) (National Commission for Scientific Research and Technology), through the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development), FONDECYT project 11170525.",,45,5,5,1,9,UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR,LOGRONO,"RECTORADO, AVENIDA DE LA PAZ, 137, LOGRONO, 26006, SPAIN",0034-9461,2174-0909,,REV ESP PEDAGOG,Rev.

The specialized literature has defined three predominant regulatory models: the traditional bureaucratic professional model, the quasi-market model inspired by neoliberal thought, and the evaluative state model linked to the notion of new public management. This paper seeks to contribute to this line of analysis by studying the evolution of the Chilean education system since 1980. We describe and analyze the models of regulation that have governed Chilean education and their expression in educational reforms and policies; we assert that Chile has adopted all three mentioned models. We also identify some of the principal consequences of these policies: a highly atomized, privatized, and socioeconomically segregated school system; an improvement in access to education and the conditions for the educational process; and an increase in learning outcomes, despite starting from very low levels and stalling during the past decade while remaining highly unequal in character. Thus, we propose some hypotheses to interpret those changes, relating them to the models of regulation as well as the policies previously analyzed. Overall, we affirm that the market and evaluative state models have achieved modest positive effects while producing relevant undesirable consequences. We conclude the paper with a reflection on the character of the particular hybridization of regulatory models developed in Chile, and the types of policy we believe should be prioritized to improve quality, increase innovation, and diminish inequity.","[Bellei, Cristian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain",,"Bellei, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",cbellei@ciae.uchile.cl; gonzalo.munozs@mail.udp.cl,"; Bellei, Cristian/D-9921-2015","Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841; Bellei, Cristian/0000-0001-6963-7809",ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Becas Chile Program,"Support from ANID/ PIA/ Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.

These approaches have diminished teaching staff engagement with continuous curriculum improvement, without necessarily improving student outcome attainment. To illustrate mechanisms that engage and disengage teaching staff, we present a case study of a 3-year continuous improvement process implemented in a selective university in Chile. Throughout the process, 61 teaching staff members were involved in outcome assessment tasks and curriculum discussions. By triangulating three sources of evidence (97 assessment plans, 27 meeting minutes and 11 interviews), we identified engagement mechanisms that were related to staff members' motivation to improve student outcomes, and disengagement mechanisms that were related to their reticence towards misaligned and externally imposed policies. Teaching staff's perspectives on continuous improvement were discussed for further generalization of these mechanisms.","[Hilliger, Isabel; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Celis, Sergio] Univ Chile, Sch Engn & Sci, FCFM, Almirante Beauchef 851, Santiago 8370456, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France",,"Hilliger, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",ihillige@ing.puc.cl,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022","Celis, Sergio/0000-0002-0502-5608",,,,30,0,0,2,10,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0952-8733,1740-3863,,HIGH EDUC POLICY,High Educ.

Interviews were held with academics at both public and private well-established universities and new private universities. The analysis shows a consensus regarding the production of certain public goods such as knowledge, wider access and the promotion of a public sphere. It also reveals a dissensus such that academics at well-established universities tend to maintain a statist view of the public university in which the state plays a key role while academics at new private universities characteristically adopt an individualist view in which the university is detached from the state and more focused on securing social mobility. Drawing on an Archerian framework, it is suggested that these perceptions have been shaped by global, national and especially institutional factors. Critical questions arise concerning the possibility of spaces for new perceptions of the public dimension of universities.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina; Labrana, Julio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Barnett, Ronald/0000-0002-6850-7639",Conicyt-ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271]; PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence Project [BF0003],"This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile, Fondecyt project 1141271 and PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centres of Excellence Project BF0003.",,40,5,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-080X,1469-9508,,J HIGH EDUC POLICY M,J.

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December). This study has implications for the length of mathematics classes at schools as well as the need to vary activities during a class.","[Beserra, Vagner] Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Oteo, Macarena] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England",,"Beserra, V (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Escuela Univ Educ Virtual, 18 Septiembre, Arica, Chile.",vagner.beserra@gmail.com,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748","FONDECYT / CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150045]; Direccion de Investigacion, Postgrado y Transferencia Tecnologica at Universidad de Tarapaca [8762-16]","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially funded by FONDECYT / CONICYT 1150045 and Direccion de Investigacion, Postgrado y Transferencia Tecnologica at Universidad de Tarapaca [UTA-Educacion N#8762-16].",,58,9,9,3,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0735-6331,1541-4140,,J EDUC COMPUT RES,J.

Design/methodology/approach - Graduates of professional psychology and teaching programs from three Chilean universities responded to a questionnaire asking their perception of different aspects of their degree program and experiences in their first employment. The three universities differ significantly in the proportion of applicants admitted, and in their prestige. Findings - Salary levels are highly related to profession, but unrelated to graduates' ratings of quality of curriculum or teaching methods. Overall satisfaction with the university experience is not linked to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction, on the other hand, is highly influenced by salary and secondarily by instructional practices and perceived work relevance of the degree program. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on data from 3 of Chile's 60 universities, and graduates of two programs. Most employment in the two professions is regulated by labor agreements. Generalizability of results is limited. Graduates may not have been employed enough to demonstrate their capacities. Practical implications - The findings offer more evidence that prestige ratings are an unreliable indicator of the quality of formation offered by universities. If the government seeks to reduce income inequality, public subsidies of higher education should be based on program quality rather than on institutional prestige. Originality/value - The findings are directly relevant to the current debate in Chile about what might and what might not help to reduce severe economic inequality.","[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar; Gonzalez, Luis; Castillo, Dante] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, Swampscott, MA USA; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Santiago, Chile",,"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Ctr Adv Studies, Vina Del Mar, Chile.; Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ, Santiago, Chile.",pirata14@hotmail.com; nmcginn@igc.org; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; dcastillo@estudiospiie.cl,"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019","McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Sandoval, Luis/0000-0001-9452-4945; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980; Castillo, Dante/0000-0002-5648-0627",Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151016],This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Fondecyt) under Grant No. 1151016.,,77,2,2,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0040-0912,1758-6127,,EDUC TRAIN,Educ.

The objective of this study is to measure the effect of incorporating a variable of predisposition to mathematical tasks to a complex model, which also considers the student's formal and inductive logical reasoning skills regarding academic mathematics performance. Our aim is to assess to what extent success in mathematics provides feedback to students and how it influences overall academic achievement. In order to do so, different instruments were used, such as TOLT (Test of Logical Thinking), TILS (Test of Higher Logical Thinking) and a Likert-type scale to measure the predisposition for mathematical tasks. The interaction between variables was modeled using structural equations. The results show the important role that predisposition for mathematical tasks plays in academic performance. They also show how this predisposition interacts and modulates the effect of cognitive factors on overall academic performance, and how it also mitigates the strength of their univariate relationships. The educational role of these findings is discussed, as well as possible ways of improving a negative predisposition towards mathematical tasks in school environments.","[Cerda, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [Romera, Eva M.; Ortega-Ruiz, Rosario; Casas, Jose A.] Univ Cordoba, San Alberto Magno S-N, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Perez, Carlos] Univ OHiggins, Cachapoal 90, Rancagua 2841158, Chile",,"Cerda, G (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion 4070386, Chile.",gamal.cerda@udec.cl; carlos.perez@uoh.cl; eva.romera@uco.es; edlorrur@uco.es; m22caboj@uco.es,"Casas, Jose A./I-8032-2017; Cerda, Gamal/Q-7398-2017; Ortega-Ruiz, Rosario/D-4268-2011; Romera, Eva M/J-7299-2016; PŽrez, Carlos/R-3979-2017","Casas, Jose A./0000-0002-0272-1835; Cerda, Gamal/0000-0002-3662-4179; Romera, Eva M/0000-0002-9414-8019; PŽrez, Carlos/0000-0001-6035-7341",,,,56,17,18,3,16,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

One of the greatest challenges in this transition is the difficulty in changing the knowledge-oriented practices of teachers. This study evaluates the consistency between syllabus design and the requirements imposed by a competence-based learning environment. To make this comparison, the study sets four criteria (C1: explicit relationship between syllabus and graduate profile; C2: precision of the learning outcomes and assessment criteria; C3: contents that mobilise the learning outcomes; and C4: learning and assessment activities) derived from the literature and a thematic analysis of competence-based learning in higher education. Afterwards, a sample of 150 syllabi from different disciplines of five Chilean public universities were analysed, all of which stated the use of learning outcomes and competences in their learning models. Using a three-point Likert scale derived from the aforementioned criteria and their indicators, a comparison was made between the actual practices reflected in the syllabus design and the previously established criteria. Results show a gap between the declaration of a competency-based curriculum and actual syllabus outlines. Moreover, there are important differences among disciplines. Although all disciplines present high levels of accomplishment for Criteria 1 and 3, only the discipline of health sciences presents an acceptable level for Criteria 2 and 4. It is recommended that further research be undertaken towards identifying effective competency-based syllabus design.","[Jerez, Oscar; Hasbun, Beatriz; Valenzuela, Gabriela; Orsini, Cesar] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Leslier] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Santiago, Chile; [Pizarro, Veronica] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management Control & Informat Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, Cesar] Univ Glasgow, Sch Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,"Jerez, O (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile.",ojerez@fen.uchile.cl,"Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Jerez, Oscar/J-2947-2016","Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Jerez, Oscar/0000-0003-0869-5938",,,,59,3,3,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-0602,1470-1278,,TEACH TEACH,Teach.

After controlling the earnings differentials by observable characteristics we find that teachers are underpaid vis-a-vis other professionals and technicians in Latin America both, circa 1997 and circa 2007; and both, at their main and secondary jobs. We document a decrease in the earnings gap during the decade of analysis, mostly attributed to a general trend in gap reduction rather than as a result of teachers' improvements on their observable characteristics. The earnings gap shows important heterogeneities, across countries and along the earnings distributions. Additionally, using information from the main and secondary jobs we find that individual penalties for teachers go beyond their observable characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the mathematics education research field, arguments have been made that the conceptualization of Mathematics Identity (MI) is inconsistent and this makes the literature as a whole incoherent. This study aims to summarize how the concept has been employed and to develop an integrative model for analyzing concept-definitions and concept-operationalizations of MLI. An analysis of 69 papers revealed 3 main dimensions that characterized how identity is conceptually defined in any research literature (social/subjective, enacted/representational and change/stability) and 5 main categories that describe how the literature has implemented these dimensions operationally (identity as individual attributes; identity as narratives; identity as a relationship with specific practices; identity as ways of acting; and identities as afforded and constrained by local practices). An emphasis on representational aspects of identities, particularly during higher education, and enacted and practice-related identities during primary and secondary education research was found.

We studied the interactions of one group of two teachers, who worked collectively in posing and solving a modeling problem through a closed group on the social network Facebook. The research question guiding this paper was how the development of mathematical modeling occurs from an Activity Theory perspective, recognizing tensions that occur, and its evolution in the process of posing and solving a modeling problem. The researchers took a qualitative approach, analyzing discursive manifestations in the modeling process. In the discussion, contradictions emerged in the group through events such as dilemma and conflict. The results indicate that the modeling task acted as an artifact that brought to light inner contradictions, and thus, allowed teachers to move from a conflict to the formulation of an open problem, and from a dilemma to the construction of a model and a pedagogic strategy.","[Galleguillos, Jeannette] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [de Carvalho Borba, Marcelo] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Galleguillos, J (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",jeannette.galleguillos@uv.cl; mborba@rc.unesp.br,,"Galleguillos, Jeannette/0000-0003-1089-0900; Borba, Marcelo/0000-0003-3101-5486",,,,43,3,3,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-9690,1863-9704,,ZDM-MATH EDUC,ZDM-Math.

The diversity of both entities intervening in the articulation, as well their nature, make possible to identify modeling as a recurrent practice in different communities. Modeling practice allows building bridges between what is done in school and in communities outside schools. In this practice, the model doesn't exist independent of the human activity. It manifests as model while intervening in the other entity, at this moment it is called the modeled entity. Despite the interaction with the entity to be modeled is necessary, its adequacy comes about with the intervention on it, through carrying out activity with the model. It is through this intervention that the modeling act is established. Articulating different models with the phenomenon, gives rise to a modeling network that strengthen the human activity for the intervention.","[Arrieta Vera, Jaime] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Guerrero, Mexico; [Diaz Moreno, Leonora] Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Vera, JA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Guerrero, Mexico.",jaime.arrieta@gmail.com; leonora.diaz@uv.cl,,,,,,31,1,1,0,3,CLAME-COMITE LATINOAMERICANO MAT EDUC,SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO,"OFFICE 101 AV INST POLITECNICO NACIONAL 2508, SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO, CP 07360, MEXICO",1665-2436,2007-6819,,REV LAT AM INV MAT E,Rev.

One of the stated objectives of the new policy was to increase the access of secondary school graduates from families with lower levels of education. To answer that concern, we analyzed administrative data from more than 800,000 students seeking university admission in 2012, 2015, and 2019. Our objective was to determine whether an increased proportion of first-generation students had been admitted to selective universities. The results show that between 2015 and 2019, the impact of the gratuity on first-generation admissions was marginal. It was of some importance only for those secondary school graduates from public schools and those who had been enrolled in the technical-professional track. The enrollment rate of these groups increased 2.2 and 2.7%, respectively. In sum, the effect of the introduction of gratuity on enrollment of first-generation students was not as impressive as expected. It has acted principally as an alternative source of finance, reducing use of other forms such as bank loans and scholarships. These results challenge directly the hypothesis that inequity in access to university is primarily attributable to financial difficulties.","[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ PIIE, Ricardo Matte Perez 0510, Santiago, Chile; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, San Ignacio Loyola 160, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, 38 Sheridan Rd, Swampscott, MA 01907 USA; [Corradi, Bruno] Univ Tarapaca, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile",,"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, 18 De Septiembre 2222, Arica, Chile.",oespinoza@academia.cl; legonzalez.fiegehen@gmail.com; lsandoval@utem.cl; nmcginn@igc.org; bruno-corradi@hotmail.com,"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019","Corradi, Bruno/0000-0002-4217-0900; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980",National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT [1200343],This research was supported by the National Agency of Research and Development of Chile (ANID) through the FONDECYT Project No1200343.

In the present study, academics in two public universities are seen to hold strong views in favour of public universities playing public roles and they identify several public goods that they value. These academics also hold ambivalent perceptions of the relationships between the state and the market. On the one hand, the market and the state's role in it are accorded a limited legitimacy. On the other hand, it is felt that the state does not sufficiently enable its public universities to realise their potential. The paper proceeds to argue that in this ambivalence can be detected four juxtapositions. It is suggested that these juxtapositions together open a space for a new settlement between the state and its public universities such that Chilean public universities might more fully realise their public possibilities.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Zavala, Ricardo; Morales, Karimme] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Arica, Chile.",cguzmanv@academicos.uta.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]; Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile [AYV028/01-19]; Economic and Social Research Council [Centre for Global Higher Education] [ES/M010082/1],"Support from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 and the Vicerrectoria de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VID) de la Universidad de Chile, codigo proyecto AYV028/01-19 are gratefully acknowledged.

Through a qualitative approach in which 20 interviews and two focus groups were conducted, this study focuses on a public university in Chile and examines ways in which academics experience time. The results reveal a felt expansion and contraction of time and timeframes to which academics accord different levels of investment. A patterning of narratives of time can be glimpsed in which academics are trading slots of time: they surrender part of their time to service institutional demands in return for time spaces in which they can pursue their own academic interests. Accordingly, the concept of time-markets may be helpful in understanding the evolution of higher education systems in neoliberal environments more generally.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Sch Psychol, Ave Brasil 2140, Valparaiso, Chile.",carolina.guzman@uv.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",,,,33,29,33,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

Findings from a thematic analysis of 68 publications show that attention to prospective principals increased after the year 2000 and this was driven by four main concerns: underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities, principal supply and demand, the principalship as a school improvement lever, and the expansion of leadership posts in schools. Selected articles addressed three dimensions of the pathways before a person is first appointed to this post: (a) micro (individual's agency), (b) meso (preparation of prospective principals), and (c) macro (policies shaping access to the post). Across time and countries, pathways to the principalship are resourced by individuals' professional orientations and by contextual factors, formal pre-service preparation may be desirable but not always available or required, and policies frame a conceptualisation of the principalship that shapes the two previous dimensions. The internationalization of research on pathways to the principalship has brought to the forefront normative assumptions that should be critically challenged when considering how to recruit, develop, and support prospective school principals.","[Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Educ Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen; Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Galdames, Sergio; Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flessa, Joseph] Univ Toronto, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl,,,[FB 003];  [1210762],"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the ANID (grant number FB 003, Grant #1210762).",,126,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

This study focuses on the contribution of school placement, controlling by motor functionality and receptive vocabulary, over several domains of participation. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 123 preadolescents and adolescents with CP, from both special and regular school systems of Chile. A quantitative approach was employed using standardised instruments (i.e. Life habits questionnaire, Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised, and Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised). Results suggest that preadolescents' participation is significantly predicted by motor functionality and receptive language in all domains of participation, but for interpersonal relationship and community.

Attending special schools exerts a negative influence on some participation domains, including mobility, responsibility, community life and recreation.

In writing, students received scaffolded practice in planning to write by filling in graphic organizers and in translating them into passages. Based on a cluster-randomized sampling process, 2,468 students distributed in 12 schools and 69 classrooms participated in the study. Schools were randomly assigned to the computer-based instruction (CBI) group or traditional instruction (TI) group. Teachers assigned to the CBI treatment integrated the applications into the language arts curriculum during one school semester. A standardized test was used to measure reading comprehension and writing. The data were analyzed through a statistical multilevel model. The findings showed that students in the CBI group improved their reading and writing skills significantly more than students under TI-yielding an effect size d = 0.30.","[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Management & Econ, Santiago 3363, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago 3363, Chile",,"Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Management & Econ, Av LB OHiggins, Santiago 3363, Chile.",hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; mario.lopez@usach.cl,"Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019","Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945",,,,58,13,13,0,51,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1042-1629,1556-6501,,ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES,ETR&D-Educ.

First, it presents the distraction and focus of attention problems that arise while using computer technology with off-the-shelf software for supporting different activities which take place in usual lectures. Examples of these activities are presentations of learning material, discussion, individual and collaborative problem solving, and difficulties of switching from one to another. A solution to this problem is an integrated approach with a particular implementation under the notion of CiC. The implemented system attempts to reduce the number of interactions needed to switch from one activity to another as well as to reduce the cognitive load for both teacher and students. The usage of both this system and standard software are compared and research results are presented. Results show the CiC is useful to solve the problem.","[Baloian, Nelson; Pino, Jose A.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Hoppe, H.

The study advances the hypothesis that emotional competences and classroom climate are mediators in school achievement. For this purpose, 420 students from secondary and further education were selected with an average age of 14.29 +/- 1.52. In emotional competence, the results showed differences according to gender and educational level, while in classroom climate, differences were only found according to educational level. The mediational analysis showed that classroom climate is an influential variable in the predictive value of emotional competence in relation to school achievement. Likewise, emotional competence acts as a mediating influence on classroom climate and school achievement. This study thus highlights the need to implement training processes to help teachers to promote positive socio-emotional contexts and programmes to develop students' emotional competence, which will improve their school achievement.","[Lopez-Gonzalez, Luis] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Oriol, Xavier] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Lopez-Gonzalez, L (corresponding author), Av Bellamar 12-14,Bloque C,Escalera 1,1-1a, Barcelona, Spain.",luislopez@programatreva.com,"Granado, Xavier Oriol/AAO-3112-2021","Granado, Xavier Oriol/0000-0001-7130-7729",,,,82,24,25,25,165,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1135-6405,1578-4118,,CULT EDUC,Cult.

We see an emergent opportunity to contribute to the current discussion on transdisciplinarity and its institutionalization at universities. Our specific interest in this paper is to disentangle the conditions under which transdisciplinarity is developed in Latin American contexts and how it can be better implemented within those contexts. Our study focuses on the context of Latin American Public Universities. We examine the following research questions: (i) How is transdisciplinarity conceptualized in university policy and what are the conditions for its institutionalization? (ii) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006-2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of situated transdisciplinarity that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes. We conclude that the concept of situated transdisciplinarity can orient transdisciplinary research policy, by problematizing discourses and perceptions.","[Salvador Riveros, Pablo; Merino, Jaqueline; Crespo, Francisco] Univ Chile, Unidad Redes Transdisciplinarias Vicerrectoria In, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Baptista, Bianca Vienni] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Transdisciplinar Lab, Univ Str 16,CHN K76-2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Riveros, PS (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Unidad Redes Transdisciplinarias Vicerrectoria In, Diagonal Paraguay 265, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",priveros@uchile.cl; jaqueline.merino@uchile.cl; francisco.crespo@uchile.cl; bianca.vienni@usys.ethz.ch,,"Vienni Baptista, Bianca/0000-0003-1282-4288",,,,95,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

In the last few years, the University of Santiago de Chile has implemented a program of English Blended Learning in arcareers of eight faculties, whose objective is to develop linguistic and communicative skills at an intermediate level. For this purpose, the program consists of three pedagogical components: classrooms lessons, tutoring and an on-line platform. At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, a process evaluation was carried out that sought to know, from the perspective of those immediately involved, how the program had been implemented, emphasizing the progress towards the fulfillment of its objectives. The data collection considered three techniques: a survey about the learning experience of the students (N = 780), a focus group with the teachers of the program and semi-structured interviews with coordinators or heads of the University. The main findings show a positive evaluation of the program when each component is observed by itself. However, the analysis of the integration between these reveals four critical tensions related to: the guidance on autonomous work, the managing of the assignment of tutorials, the transition from the pedagogical contents of the platform to the class and the functional differentiation between the components of the program.","[Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Univ Santiago Chile, Polit Equidad & Programas Inclus Educ Super, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Linguist & Literatura, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Univ Santiago Chile, Area Evaluat VRA, Santiago, Chile; [Martinic Lenta, Rodolfo] 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France; [Urzua Martinez, Sergio] Perpetua Freire 821, Santiago, Chile; [Ubeda Menichetti, Ricardo] Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Aranda Gengler, Roxana] Pica 1031, Santiago, Chile",,"Lenta, RM (corresponding author), Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Trayectorias Educ & Laborales & Evalaudor Program, Paris, France.; Lenta, RM (corresponding author), 23 Rue Emile Lepeu, F-75011 Paris, France.",rodolfo.martinic@gmail.com; sergio.urzua@usach.cl; ricardo.ubeda@usach.cl; roxana.aranda@usach.cl,,,,,,31,0,0,5,9,ASOC IBEROAMERICANA EDUCACION SUPERIOR DISTANCIA,MADRID,"UNED, FAC EDUC, C/ JUAN DEL ROSAI, 14, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",1138-2783,1390-3306,,RIED-REV IBEROAM EDU,RIED-Rev.

It firstly offers an overview of the considerable empirical literature around teaching-especially conceptions of teaching, approaches to teaching and teaching practices-and goes on to pose some philosophical and social theoretical considerations that open further the territory around teaching in university. Against this background, we propose the concept of 'horizons of teaching'. Horizons of teaching provide a context in which it makes sense for teachers to give themselves to the teaching enterprise and to go on giving themselves to teaching. Horizons include diverse and intricate layers at both micro- and macro-levels that interact in a permanent and dynamic way; they involve persons and collectivities; and they concern structures and agency. The paper concludes by proposing that horizons of teaching configure and delineate curricula and the pedagogical relationship in a way that might contain a revolutionary potentiality in recasting teaching in higher education.","[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",r.barnett@ioe.ac.uk; carolina.guzman@ciae.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",PIA-CONICYT (Chile) Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [BF0003]; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141271],We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers of this paper for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

However, neither of these perspectives gives much consideration to the teaching framework in which the computer is actually used. In order to address this issue, a case study was designed to explore teachers' concepts and beliefs about computers. In this case study two teachers were involved in a software development process, and observation of their discussions during this process was used as a technique to uncover the teachers' beliefs about using computers. The case study led to a model of how teachers use computers in classroom teaching. This model conceptualizes the computer as a teaching resource that helps teachers to develop their teaching strategy, replacing the teachers in their role of managing students' rehearsal of materials and serving as a classroom management tool. This model of using computers demonstrates significant links between teachers' teaching strategies and the use of computers in education and thereby provides a support for a view of computers as professional tools for educators.","Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, London WC1H 0AL, England; Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile",,"Mellar, H (corresponding author), Univ London, Inst Educ, Sci & Technol Grp, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",,"Hinostroza, J.

Based on interviews with school teachers and principals, the study focused on collaboration engagement and factors conditioning its modalities and depth. Findings indicate that more than country differences and between school differences, collaboration factors and experiences vary according to teacher perception of its value, collective efficacy, school culture/practices and leadership, and in Chile by rural/urban location. Collaboration forms rarely involve more than mutual learning based on sharing of experience. However, involvement in school-based external projects engage teachers in deeper forms of collaboration. Available spaces, time, work-load, systemic policies, testing/accountability are limiting factors.","[Avalos-Bevan, Beatrice] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Maria Assuncao] Univ Minho, Inst Educ, Braga, Portugal",,"Avalos-Bevan, B (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.",bavalos254@gmail.com,"Flores, Maria Assuncao/A-6113-2013","Flores, Maria Assuncao/0000-0002-4698-7483","Fondecyt Project ANID/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [1150598, BF0003]; Portuguese Fundos Nacionais FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, COMPETE 2020 -Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao [POCI-01-0145FEDER-007562]","We gratefully acknowledge research funding from: (1) Fondecyt Project [1150598] ANID/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [BF0003]; and (2) Portuguese Fundos Nacionais FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) & Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, COMPETE 2020 -Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao [POCI-01-0145FEDER-007562].",,42,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/03057925.2020.1854085,,DEC 2020,19,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,PO8PT,WOS:000605429000001,,,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

This study analysed the explanations provided by student teachers in STEM areas from a socio-materiality perspective focused on verbal and nonverbal language and representations. The study was conducted in a hybrid research format by scholars and a preservice teacher. First, the study compared the representational elements used by 86 student teachers to construct explanations about various concepts in a roleplay setting. Next, a positioning analysis was done by a preservice teacher, to a selection of five of these explanations focused on the concept of force. The positioning analysis highlighted the embedded voices in the construction of explanations, with a focus on the intersection between science and language. The results showed that the student teachers created explanations as static artefacts, mainly using examples, graphs and images to clarify the concepts. The voices of learners and scientists were mostly absent from the explanations, which led to the presentation of explanations in STEM areas as finished and unquestionable artefacts, with references neither to nature nor to the history of science. We reflect on the meanings attributed to learning to be a practitioner in the context of interconnecting science and language through explanations, as a process of meaning (re)production within the classroom. Implications for teacher education are discussed in order to enhance student teachers' awareness about constructing knowledge by enacting explanations in the science classroom.","[Cabello, Valeria M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Real, Constanza] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile; [Impedovo, Maria Antonietta] Aix Marseille Univ, ADEF, Marseille, France",,"Cabello, VM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",vmcabello@uc.cl; constanza.real@ug.uchile.cl; maria-antonietta.IMPEDOVO@univ-amu.fr,"Cabello, Valeria M./AAA-1012-2019; impedovo, maria/L-6471-2016","Cabello, Valeria M./0000-0001-6190-9187; impedovo, maria/0000-0003-2172-7105",CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional [REDES180109]; Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion,"This work was financially supported by CONICYT Programa de Cooperacion Internacional REDES180109, Concurso de apoyo a la formacion de redes internacionales entre centros de investigacion.",,67,0,0,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0157-244X,1573-1898,,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to the social class background of university faculty and how it might affect their pathways to the professoriate and their opportunities to access high-paying positions. We attempted to address this gap in the literature by looking at a sample of faculty working at Chilean universities. We used a path analysis approach to estimate not only the direct effects of social class of origin on income but also the indirect mechanisms through which social class of origin influences faculty income. We posed two alternative conceptual perspectives with regard to the effects of social class on income-social reproduction and human capital. We found that faculty who come from the upper social class have access to higher-quality undergraduate education and to more prestigious PhD-granting universities and they report higher earnings as compared with those who come from a low social class. These findings resemble a dynamic of cumulative educational advantages that provides grounds to the theory of social reproduction. Although it could be argued that the positive effect of prestige of the PhD-granting university on income is in line with the human capital theory, we claim that such effect cannot be analyzed independently from the direct and indirect relationships that exist between social class of origin and the prestige of the university from which faculty obtained their doctorate degrees.","[Chiappa, Roxana] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Miller Hall,2012 Skagit Ln, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Perez Mejias, Paulina] Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Mejias, PP (corresponding author), Univ Chile, CIAE, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile.",rchiappa@uw.edu; paulina.perez@ciae.uchile.cl,"Mejias, Paulina Perez/AAV-3206-2021; Perez Mejias, Paulina/O-7600-2017","Chiappa Baros, Roxana/0000-0002-3523-1197; Perez Mejias, Paulina/0000-0002-8024-4843",,,,85,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

However, there are students who, despite living in impoverished conditions, achieve solid academic performance. How they do so is a question of central importance. The present study uses the concept of resilience as a theoretical framework that can help us to answer it. It investigates various characteristics common to the students, families, and schools of Chile, and places emphasis on understanding resilience as it relates to the academic achievement of students with low SES. Multilevel models and comparisons reveal performance determinants associated with resilience, such as reading engagement and schooling conditions.

We conclude by identifying the traits of a critical thinker as an actor who constructs and registers the potentialities of cognition and relates them to praxis, that is, with a reflexive action oriented towards decision-making.","[Martin Garcia, Antonio Victor] Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain; [Bradasic, Oscar Barrientos] Univ Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile",,"Garcia, AVM (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Dept Teoria & Hist Educ, Paseo Canalejas 169, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",avmg@usal.es; obradasic@hotmail.com,"Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/L-4931-2014","Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/0000-0002-0216-2754",,,,52,0,0,0,5,EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA,SALAMANCA,"APARTADO DE CORREOS 325, SALAMANCA, 00000, SPAIN",1130-3743,2386-5660,,TEOR EDUC,Teor.

The reform calls for de-municipalization of the public school sector (345 municipal education departments under mayoral control) and the creation of 70 Servicios Locales de Educacion Publica (SLEPs) between 2018 and 2025. The reform represents a largescale attempt to improve and save public education in Chile. This analysis is based on case studies of implementation of the first four SLEPs in the first year of the reform. Using Stake's method for multiple case study analysis, the analysis explores how context influences the professional capacity of the SLEPs to provide professional assistance to schools. The study relates to research on the effectiveness of intermediate level agencies in school systems and on contextual influences on organizational innovation and capacity building. The analysis reveals that contextual factors shaping initial professional capacity of the SLEPs reinforced traditional practices of local education agency support to schools in three of the four cases. The differentiating factor centered on the actions of local agency leaders who responded to capacity gaps and lack of direction from government authorities as either constraints on change or as an opportunity for innovation.","[Anderson, Stephen] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Anderson, Stephen] OISE Comparat Int & Dev Educ Program & Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Uribe, Mario] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Educ Leaders, Valparaiso, Chile; [Uribe, Mario] Fdn Chile, Sch Management & Leadership Program, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, Inst Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Juan Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile",,"Anderson, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.",steve.anderson@utoronto.ca,,,ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence,"The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research funding in Chile from ANID-PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence.",,40,2,2,6,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

We observed the teaching of SMIs and preservice teachers (PSTs) with observation rubrics to gauge the fidelity to which they implemented practices. Across programs, SMIs provided opportunities for PSTs to experience the instructional practices as intended, although there was less opportunity for pedagogical development around them. The strongest evidence of PST fidelity to the intervention was found for two practices: Increasing student interaction and Facilitating student talk. Considerable variation was found across the programs for other practices including some evidence of negative effects.

Influential comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved in these kinds of imposed-etic approaches, such as (1) universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the components' significances, (3) the congruence between languages and conceptions, and (4) the components' coverage of the phenomena. Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We investigate the premise of universality within the examined components by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is simply unjustifiable.

For this reason, it seems interesting to review other elements that do not belong to structural factors and that can be addressed by the educational community to support students who live in that reality. There is great evidence of the incidence of variables such as attributive styles, self-regulation strategies, school coexistence and academic self-concept regarding school performance, but a specific and joint analysis of these variables for vulnerable realities could provide clues to educational communities in order to prioritize and implement improvement opportunities. The objective of this work was to examine the joint effect of the aforementioned factors with respect to the academic achievement of middle third and fourth year students from vulnerable Chilean schools. The study involved secondary school students from highly socially vulnerable contexts (N=1498). Four Likert scale surveys were used for data collection, which were applied massively and online. Through the Structural Equations Model, results show that academic self-concept obtained the highest statistical significance (beta=.22; p<.05), followed by self-regulation strategies (beta=.12; p<.05). It was also observed that the indiscipline factor obtained a significant but inverse association (beta=-.22; p<.05) with the grades of the general average of the students. The correlations between the variables were also significant, showing that school performance would have a stronger and positive correlation with self-regulation strategies and academic self-concept. The conclusions focus on the anticipation and prevention of situations of indiscipline, the promotion of a positive academic self-concept and the implementation of specific programs that contribute to improvement in self-regulation strategies; considered as practices or actions located within the scope of action of the educational community.","[Vera Sagredo, Angelica] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Cerda Etchepare, Gamal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Aragon Mendizabal, Estibaliz] Univ Cadiz, Dept Psicol, Cadiz, Spain; [Perez Wilson, Carlos] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Rancagua, Chile",,"Sagredo, AV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.",avera@ucsc.cl; gamal.cerda@udec.cl; estivaliz.aragon@uca.es; carlos.perez@uoh.cl,,,,,,68,0,0,1,1,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

Because learning progressions lay out how students' ideas change over a long period of time, learning progressions could help teachers build better understanding of student thinking, appropriate learning goals, and instructional moves for supporting students in developing more sophisticated ideas. In this study, we explored the potential of learning progression-based curriculum materials to support teachers in developing more sophisticated content knowledge (CK) and pedagocial content knowledge (PCK) for teaching about water in environmental systems. Teachers participated in professional development that introduced them to a learning progression for water in environmental systems and curriculum materials based on this learning progression. Teachers completed written assessments of their CK and PCK prior to the workshops and a year later. Analyses showed that teachers who taught lessons using the learning progression-based curriculum materials showed modest increases in CK, knowledge of learning goals, and knowledge of student thinking. These increases were greater than analogous changes evident for teachers who did not use the curriculum materials. However, even among those who implemented the curriculum materials, teachers' post-assessment performance did not yet reflect knowledge for supporting students in developing model-based reasoning about water. These results show that learning progressions have potential for supporting teacher learning, but that the ubiquity of traditional school science discourse may limit their potential for both student and teacher progress toward model-based reasoning.","[Gunckel, Kristin L.; Salinas, Ivan] Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Covitt, Beth A.] Univ Montana, SpectrUM Discovery Area, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Salinas, Ivan] Univ Chile, Dept Estudios Pedag, Santiago, Chile",,"Gunckel, KL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Teaching Learning & Sociocultural Studies, 1430 E 2nd St,POB 210069, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",kgunckel@email.arizona.edu,"Barrios, Ivan Salinas/I-7485-2018","Barrios, Ivan Salinas/0000-0002-5675-3920","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DRL-1020176, DUE-0832173]","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: DRL-1020176 and DUE-0832173",,62,11,11,7,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4308,1098-2736,,J RES SCI TEACH,J.

Findings indicate that the association between the school's aggregate family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores is much greater in the private-voucher sector than in the public one, resulting in marked socioeconomic stratification of test scores in the Chilean voucher system. We also find that the amount of tuition fees paid by parents in private-voucher schools has no bearing on test scores, after controlling for the socioeconomic makeup of the school.

However, in education, there is extensive evidence about the negative effects of predominant accountability systems, which call their expected positive impacts into question. Some of the detrimental effects of these systems involve unequal distribution of knowledge as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of vulnerable students, minorities and powerless groups, and of the schools that serve them. This evidence, along with emerging demands for social justice in terms of participation and recognition, highlights the need to analyse the shortcomings of current accountability systems in connection to ideals of social justice in education. On the basis of a review of relevant literature that connects the areas of social justice, education and assessment and accountability systems, this paper aims at illustrating some of the significant challenges and potential new avenues for the development of more just and, therefore, more intelligent accountability systems.","[Florez Petour, Maria Teresa; Rozas Assael, Tamara] Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Rozas Assael, Tamara] Inst Educ UCL, London, England",,"Petour, MTF (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile.",mtflorez@u.uchile.cl; tamarindo.rozas@gmail.com,,,CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [REDES 170112],"Funding was provided by CONICYT for the project A network of research centres around assessment and social justice; SLATE, CIESAS and the Centre for Studies on Educational Assessment (Grant No. REDES 170112).",,96,4,6,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1389-2843,1573-1812,,J EDUC CHANG,J.

Some responses produce real, broad increases in learning, but other responses can raise reported test scores without increasing learning. We estimate the effect of an accountability program on reading scores and math scores in Chile. Over a 6-year period, fourth-grade reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, on average, and half the rise was due to the accountability program. However, many schools, especially schools serving disadvantaged students, inflated their accountability ratings by having low-performing students miss high-stakes tests. To encourage healthier responses to accountability, we recommend setting accountability goals that are attainable for schools with disadvantaged students, and providing incentives for all students to take high-stakes tests.","[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ la Frontera, Temuco, Chile.",alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com; paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com,,,,,,37,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1874-8597,1874-8600,,EDUC ASSESS EVAL ACC,Educ.

Yet graduation and persistence rates remain low. One way to improve graduation and persistence is to use data and analytics to identify students at risk of dropout, target interventions, and evaluate interventions' effectiveness at improving student success. We illustrate the potential of this approach using data from eight Chilean universities. Results show that data available at matriculation are only weakly predictive of persistence, while prediction improves dramatically once data on university grades become available. Some predictors of persistence are under policy control. Financial aid predicts higher persistence, and being denied a first-choice major predicts lower persistence. Student success programmes are ineffective at some universities; they are more effective at others, but when effective they often fail to target the highest risk students. Universities should use data regularly and systematically to identify high-risk students, target them with interventions, and evaluate those interventions' effectiveness.","[Von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile",,"Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Nucleo Ciencias Sociales, Temuco, Chile.",alvaro.hofflinger@gmail.com,,,Universidad de La Frontera,This work was supported by the Universidad de La Frontera [Apoyo Pasantias En El Extranjero Para Investigadores/As Ufro].,,34,7,7,5,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-080X,1469-9508,,J HIGH EDUC POLICY M,J.

Concerned about first year failures among first-generation students, a university in Chile devised a between-semesters course intended to allow failed students to remain with their entering class. The course had three major elements: compression of a semester's course work into 2 weeks; use of incentives to motivate students to prepare for classes; and flipped class participation. In 2014, this intensive course was offered in the break between the first and second semesters. Some 310 students in Health Sciences who had failed at least one of three required courses were invited to enroll; 140 signed up. At the end of the course, more than 90% of the students taking the intensive course passed the regular final examination they had previously failed and continued with their entering class. With no additional intervention, over the next seven semesters, students who had taken the intensive course performed as well in their courses as those who had not and were less likely to drop out.

However, these reforms are tied to two different realities that conflict with each other: a formative reality, which promotes a school climate of local decision-making and the improvement of school performance; and a punitive reality, which prioritizes improvement in the school climate through accountability protocols and regulations. We used Actor-Network Theory to describe the network of actors that underlie these realities. We analyzed key documents and conducted active interviews with actors responsible for the design and implementation of these policies. Results show that the assembled network enacts an accountability reality by means of the Law on Assurance of the Quality of Education, with key devices and s-objects performing the network. However, this enacted reality is at odds with a logic of school improvement that is still defended by the Ministry of Education, an actor that is no longer the main source of translation in the network. These results are discussed in light of the so-called global triumph of New Public Management through the dissemination of specific instruments that bring together subjects and objects in enacting the reality of accountability.","[Lopez, Veronica; Sisto, Vicente; Gloria Nunez, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Sisto, Vicente] TRASAS, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Baleriola, Enrique] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Garcia, Antonio] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Carrasco, Claudia] Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdes, Rene] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile; [Valdes, Rene] Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.",veronica.lopez@pucv.cl,"Baleriola, Enrique/AAG-6291-2019; Valdes, Rene/AAW-3894-2021; Carrasco, Claudia/AAF-6848-2021; Lopez, Veronica/K-5472-2014","Baleriola, Enrique/0000-0003-2899-6316; Valdes, Rene/0000-0003-4242-9748; Carrasco, Claudia/0000-0002-8768-2440; Lopez, Veronica/0000-0001-7405-3859","FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1191267, 1140960, 1191015, 11190195]; PIA CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [160009]","Funding was received from FONDECYT 1191267, FONDECYT 1140960, FONDECYT 1191015, FONDECYT 11190195, and PIA CONICYT 160009.",,42,2,2,3,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

We employed a nested model of identity based on a case study approach (i.e., female mathematics students nested within a cluster of students nested within a mathematics classroom). The results highlight diversity in how these girls experienced mathematics: They valued different forms of doing mathematics (independent and collaborative; wider and complex; and straightforward, procedure-oriented mathematics), showed different forms of engagement (detachment, protagonist and challenging, and compliant and support-seeker), and narrated different MIs (efficient, different, and responsible). The study also explores and discusses the roles of mathematical practice and belonging to different peer clusters in these different forms of identification.","[Radovic, Darinka] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Dept Math Engn, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Black, Laura; Williams, Julian] Univ Manchester, Inst Educ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Salas, Christian E.] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Psicol, LaNCyS, Vergara 275, Santiago, Chile",,"Radovic, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Fis & Matemat, Dept Math Engn, Ctr Math Modeling, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.",dradovic@dim.uchile.cl; laura.black@manchester.ac.uk; salasriquelme@gmail.com; julian.williams@manchester.ac.uk,,"Williams, Julian/0000-0003-0161-0532; Black, Laura/0000-0002-3845-0459",National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT); Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM); Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS [2807],"This work was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research in Chile (CONICYT) and by the Center for Mathematical Modeling through a Basal project (CMM) and Unite Mixte Internationale UMI CNRS 2807.

Pre-service secondary teachers showed lower success than pre-service primary teachers in a number sense test. Nevertheless, these last based their reasoning mainly on rules and algorithms, while pre-service secondary teachers used more strategies of number sense. In an attempt to delve into the low success shown by of Spanish pre-service secondary teachers, some students were interviewed.

We analysed a national database that includes measures taken in 2007, 2011, and 2013 from a same sample of over 140,000 students. Multilevel-growth models were used to analyse the trajectories, and linear adjustment with propensity score matching was used to control for confounding variables. We found positive effects of voucher education on intercepts which, after controlling for schools' socioeconomic composition and selection policies, became irrelevant in terms of effect sizes. Regarding slopes, voucher schools have a significant positive effect, which is irrelevant in terms of effect sizes if 1 year is considered, but relevant for a 12-year school trajectory. The results illustrate a stratification between the public and voucher systems during a period when intense neoliberal policies were enforced.","[Giaconi, Valentina] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Bressoux, Pascal] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Rech Sur Apprentissages Contexte EA602, Grenoble, France; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Math Modeling, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Felmer, Patricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Giaconi, V (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile.",valentina.giaconi@uoh.cl,,,ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Apoyo a Centros de Excelencia [ACE210010]; Proyecto Fondo BasalComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL [FB210005]; Beca Doctorado Nacional [21130684]; supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC [ECM-02],"This work was partially supported by ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003, Apoyo a Centros de Excelencia ACE210010, Proyecto Fondo Basal FB210005, and Beca Doctorado Nacional 2013 Grant number 21130684.

The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics - using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity - to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom. However, the boundaries between researchers and science teachers should consider the cultural worlds of participants in the partnerships.","[Guerrero, Gonzalo R.; Reiss, Michael J.] UCL Inst Educ, London, England; [Guerrero, Gonzalo R.] Univ Santiago Chile, Unidad Innovac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Guerrero, GR (corresponding author), 3 Barton Close, Cambridge CB3 9LQ, England.",g.hernandez@ucl.ac.uk,"Reiss, Michael/P-8205-2017","Reiss, Michael/0000-0003-1207-4229; Guerrero, Gonzalo/0000-0002-7207-4880",,,,56,3,3,4,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

In this article we present an approach to this problem from the classroom practice, describing and analysing some aspects of the content and nature of the knowledge of two primary school teachers when working on the measurement of time with their students. We have adopted a qualitative methodology, and three moments of the teachers' interventions have been considered as a reflective action research cycle: for practice, in practice and on practice. To this end, planning and intervention sessions have been recorded for two primary school teachers and their actions have been interpreted in consideration of the analytical model Mathematics Teachers' Specialised Knowledge (MTSK). This analysis has revealed that teachers are aware of the complexity of dealing with the reading and recording of time when they plan their intervention, and therefore they recognize the need to teach how to use the clock. Our first findings point out the need to provide the students with references for the units of time and to emphasize the functioning of the measuring instrument, questioning the usefulness of the analogue clock.","[Pizarro, Noetni] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Miguel Belmonte, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Fac Educ, Ctr Formac Profesorado, Rector Royo Villanova S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala de Henares, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Arteaga-Martinez, Blanca] Univ Alcala, Dept Fis & Matemat, Campus Univ, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain",,"Pizarro, N (corresponding author), Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Dept Matemat, Jose Pedro Alessandri 774, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",noemi.pizarro@umce.c1; belmonte@ucm.es; blanca.arteaga@uah.es,"Arteaga-Mart’nez, Blanca/G-4802-2016","Arteaga-Mart’nez, Blanca/0000-0002-1079-1526",,,,35,0,0,1,10,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

Scientific texts are conceptually and linguistically complex, especially for students from low-income contexts because they have neither the experience with the language nor the literacy skills to face the challenges of scientific knowledge. This study used a mix method approach to compare the cognitive scaffolding practiced by teachers during science reading activities in high- and low-performing schools. Three teachers and 141 fourth grade students from low socioeconomic background schools participated in 48 class sessions. Classes were video-recorded and transcribed. The data were analyzed using Sanchez' Pedagogic Practice Analysis System. The results show that teachers from both types of schools continuously use reading as a tool for learning. The effective teacher uses reading with non-invasive scaffolding and varied verbal participation to elaborate knowledge, promoting literal and inferential comprehension and more opportunities for the students to construct knowledge. By contrast, less effective teachers use reading with invasive scaffolding and little verbal participation of the students to consolidate knowledge, promoting mainly literal comprehension. This study shed light on different approaches teachers use to foster reading comprehension for science learning.","[Rojas Rojas, Sandra Patricia] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Dept Ciencias Ambiente, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363,Estac Cent, Santiago, Chile; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Sanchez Miguel, Emilio] Univ Salamanca, Dept Psicol, Salamanca, Spain",,"Rojas, SPR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Quim & Biol, Dept Ciencias Ambiente, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 3363,Estac Cent, Santiago, Chile.",sandra.rojas.r@usah.cl,"ROJAS, SANDRA PATRICIA ROJAS/AAU-5018-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017","ROJAS, SANDRA PATRICIA ROJAS/0000-0001-6284-5373; Sanchez Miguel, Emilio/0000-0001-8157-9824","Proyect DICYT, Departamento de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (DICYT) [031941]; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile; FONDECYT, CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150332]","The study was sponsored by Proyect DICYT 031941 RR, Departamento de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (DICYT), Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile and FONDECYT REGULAR 1150332, CONICYT, Chile.",,50,3,3,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

Is their effect moderated by the type of dropouts who participate? Chile recently opened a national programme of Second Opportunity Schools (Escuelas de Segunda Oportunidad). Their mission is to provide primary and high school dropouts between 14 and 18 years of age an opportunity to complete their studies. Latent Class analysis, based on conventional demographic and current activity data, was used to classify these students into four distinct groups. The groups varied in their level of satisfaction (or engagement) with the Second Opportunity School in which they were studying. Within each School, the groups' satisfaction varied according to the activities in which students participated. That is, variation in satisfaction was more a result of student characteristics than differences between Schools. Some activities were more effective than others in engaging or satisfying some types of students.

In each of both countries, over two thousand teachers of all school levels and types were surveyed during a two-month period on their professional experiences in the first year of remote teaching. The article discusses teacher accounts of how their work changed, their difficulties, impact on well-being, as well as new professional learning brought about by the challenges involved. Conceptually, the study relied on notions of occupational professionalism, self-efficacy perceptionsand collegial support in challenging circumstances. Results in both countries highlighted an impact on teacher occupational professionalism and self-efficacy perceptions, mainly brought about by intermittent levels of engagement of students during remote teaching sessions, and difficulties in carrying out proper assessments of student learning. Student well-being was of greater concern to teachers than their own problems, despite feeling the stressful effect of much longer daily working hours, more so among Chilean than Portuguese teachers. The study also brought out teachers' imaginative efforts and the use of unaccustomed pedagogic strategies to reach out to students and insure some level of learning, especially among those without internet connectivity.","[Avalos, Beatrice; Araneda, Sebastian] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Flores, Maria Assuncao] Univ Minho, Inst Educ, Res Ctr Child Studies, Braga, Portugal",,"Avalos, B (corresponding author), Alsacia 150,Dept 33 Las Condes, Santiago 7550073, Chile.",bavalos254@gmail.com,,,"PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/00317/2020, UIDP700317/2020]","This work was supported by the PIA-ANID Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB003 [Project FB003]; Portuguese National, Foundation for Science and Technology [Project UIDB/00317/2020 and UIDP700317/2020].",,36,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-0602,1470-1278,,TEACH TEACH,Teach.

When the bottom reservoir is heated, the system may experience periodic eruptions of hot water and steam at the top similarly to the geyser effect occurring in nature. The eruption frequency of a toy geyser is inspected experimentally as a function of the heating power and the height of the setup. We propose a thermodynamic model of this system that predicts the time between eruptions. A phase diagram that takes into account the thermal energy provided to the geyser and the geometry was constructed for the toy geyser. The conditions to obtain the geyser effect have been determined. The study of the toy geyser is then extended to the case of two reservoirs connected to the same tube. Such a coupled system adopts a complex time evolution that reflects the dynamics of natural geysers. We analyze the behavior of a toy geyser with two reservoirs by way of statistical tools and develop a theoretical model in order to rationalize our observations.","[Brandenbourger, M.; Dorbolo, S.; Darbois Texier, B.] Univ Liege, Phys Dept, GRASP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Brandenbourger, M.] Univ Amsterdam, IOP, Soft Matter Grp, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Darbois Texier, B.] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Fis, SMAT C, Ave Ecuador 3493, Santiago 9170124, Chile",,"Dorbolo, S (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Phys Dept, GRASP, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",s.dorbolo@uliege.be,"Brandenbourger, Martin/AAC-4715-2021; Darbois Texier, Baptiste/F-2747-2015","Darbois Texier, Baptiste/0000-0002-8772-3433; Brandenbourger, Martin/0000-0002-5550-1895",Inter-University Attraction Poles ProgrammeBelgian Federal Science Policy Office [IAP 7/38 MicroMAST]; FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"This research has been funded by the Inter-University Attraction Poles Programme (IAP 7/38 MicroMAST) initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office.

In addition, we conducted a large-scale survey of research biologists within these fields about their use of, and training in, mathematics and statistics. We then performed follow-up interviews with a purposeful sample of respondents. Our results indicate that biologists need a base in descriptive and inferential statistics and mathematical modeling, including some concepts from calculus, focused on conceptual understanding rather than computational accuracy, followed by differentiated programs of study in mathematics and statistics, depending on intended discipline within biology.

A novel experimental economics approach based on a computational Web platform of an electricity market is proposed here for the practical teaching of electrical engineering students. The approach is designed to diminish the gap that exists between theory and practice in this field, through a methodological strategy for teaching/learning called simulation. In the proposed simulation exercise, groups of students operate as market agents and have the freedom to create their own strategies. Additionally, a theoretical model and a specific simulation tool are used for the evaluation of the proposed strategies. The test system is based on the market structure of the Chilean wholesale electricity market and was tested on student groups at two universities. Based on the students' performance, the strategic behavior of agents and their impact on market price evolution are described and analyzed.

Background: University education is committed to change and adaptation to the current and new realities of the world. The framework for measuring the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) outcomes and Conceive- Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) syllabus have developed a list of competencies required by engineering students, encouraging universities to meet real-world needs. Intended Outcomes: Rethinking the role of engineering education and the purpose of education in the engineer's professional development, proposing a roadmap for engineering educators, helping them to define which teaching-learning techniques to apply to develop the competencies and skills that university and industry require from future engineers. Application Design: A relationship is shown between the competencies that today's engineers must have according to ABET criterion 3 (i.e., student outcomes), which are required for continuous accreditation of the engineering and CDIO syllabus, and the respective didactic techniques considered in this research. Findings: To develop competencies, students should be taught based on different teaching-learning techniques in higher education. A relationship is proposed for the engineering educator, showing them which didactic technique could be adequate to be applied in the classroom to develop in students the specific competencies established by ABET (SO1 to SO7) and CDIO (SL1 to SL4).","[Forcael, Eric; Garces, Gonzalo] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile; [Orozco, Francisco] Univ Panamer, Coll Engn, Zapopan 45010, Mexico",,"Forcael, E (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Concepcion 4050231, Chile.",eforcael@ubiobio.cl; gegarces@ubiobio.cl; forozco@up.edu.mx,,,,,,79,0,0,8,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9359,1557-9638,,IEEE T EDUC,IEEE Trans.

The small age and gender effects were quite similar across societies. The rank orders of mean item ratings were similar across diverse societies. For 7,380 children from 13 societies, ratings were also obtained from a parent. In all 13 societies, mean Total Problems scores derived from parent ratings were significantly higher than mean Total Problems scores derived from caregiver/teacher ratings, although the size of the difference varied somewhat across societies. Mean cross-informant agreement for problem scale scores varied across societies. Societies were very similar with respect to which problem items, on average, received high versus low ratings from parents and caregivers/teachers. Within every society, cross-informant agreement for item ratings varied widely across children.

For that reason, and with the aim of answering the growing demand for an adequate evaluation instrument for this group, the KidsLife scale was developed. Method: This research provides evidence of the reliability and validity of the scale, which is composed of 96 items spread over eight subscales, and completed by a third-party respondent. The validation sample comprised 1060 people with intellectual disability, with ages ranging from 4 to 21 years old (M = 13.51; SD = 5.04). Results: The results suggest that the eight quality of life domains assessed on the scale are reliable (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.812 to 0.949). The evidence of the validity of the construct provided by Confirmatory Factor Analysis also demonstrated adequate indexes of fit for the eight-domain model. Discussion: Future lines of research which may use the KidsLife Scale are suggested and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-six deaf participants (13 children, 13 adolescents), whose first language was Chilean Sign Language (CHSL), were examined. Their dactylic abilities were evaluated with tasks involving the reading and writing of dactylic and orthographic codes. The study included three experiments: (a) the identification of Chilean signs and fingerspelled words, (b) the matching of fingerspelled words with commercial logos, and (c) the decoding of fingerspelled words and the mapping of these words onto the writing system. The results provide convergent evidence that the use of fingerspelling and sign language is related to orthographic skills. It is concluded that fingerspelling can facilitate the internal representation of words and serve as a supporting mechanism for reading acquisition.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Cognit Proc, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Methodol & Behav Sci, Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Biofunct Studies, Madrid, Spain; Metropolitan Univ Santiago, Postgrad Sch, Santiago, Chile",,"Puente, A (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Psychol, Somosaguas Campus, Madrid, Spain.",,"Alvarado, Jesus M./K-7296-2017","Alvarado, Jesus M./0000-0003-4780-0147",,,,49,27,32,1,6,GALLAUDET UNIV PRESS,WASHINGTON,"800 FLORIDA AVE NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002 USA",0002-726X,1543-0375,,AM ANN DEAF,Am.

However, given the accelerating demographic, environmental, economical, socio-political, and technological changes-and their associated risks and opportunities-there is increasing consensus that our current educational systems are falling short and that we need to repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Futures of Education initiative was formally launched at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 to provide such a vision of education for the future. The International Scientific and Evidence-based Education (ISEE) Assessment synthesizes knowledge streams generated by different communities and stakeholders at all levels and scales and will thereby essentially contribute to re-envisioning this future of education. The overall aim of the ISEE Assessment is to pool the expertise from a broad range of knowledge holders and stakeholders to undertake a scientifically robust and evidence-based assessment in an open and inclusive manner of our current educational systems and its necessary reforms. In this commentary, we discuss the aims and goals of the ISEE Assessment. We describe how the ISEE Assessment will address key questions on the purpose of education and what, how, where and when we learn, and evaluate the alignment of today's education and theory of learning with the current and forthcoming needs and challenges and to inform policymaking for future education.","[Duraiappah, Anantha; Mochizuki, Yoko; Ramaswamy, Rajiv; Chatterjee Singh, Nandini] UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Inst Educ Peace & Sustaina, New Delhi, India; [van Atteveldt, Nienke; Buil, J.

The effect of the use of computer simulations in the course shows that the students who were taught with simulation gained a better understanding of linear scheduling concepts and techniques than those students taught without simulation. The data and analysis leading to this finding are presented and discussed in this paper. Two groups of students were considered in this research: (1) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida and (2) civil engineering students from the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Chile. Each group was randomly separated into two subgroups: one subgroup was taught by using the traditional method of linear scheduling (without the use of computer simulation) and the other subgroup was taught by using simulations. At the end of the teaching period, the students in both subgroups answered an objective test-type questionnaire specifically designed to address their understanding of linear scheduling techniques. They were also required, in a more subjective way, to provide their evaluation of the teaching method involved. To assess the effect of incorporating computer simulation in teaching linear scheduling, the students' evaluations and answers to the questionnaire were statistically compared. The analysis of the responses showed significant differences between the students' understanding of the subject by using the two teaching methods, with the use of computer simulation shown to be a more effective teaching tool for linear scheduling techniques.

Traditional teaching sessions were imparted to the first group, which was designated as the control group, whereas the CPM was taught to the second group via the PBL teaching methodology. After the classroom sessions, an evaluation tool was applied: responses were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Fisher statistics, and a set of open-ended questions were qualitatively analyzed via a pattern-matching technique. The results for the group that utilized PBL were favorable; this finding demonstrated the efficiency of this tool for teaching CPM. In addition, the results for the students that applied PBL methodology demonstrated a high degree of acceptance of the CPM methodology, which motivates its implementation into teaching other subjects related to project scheduling in civil engineering.

This definition invites transcending environmental education and education for sustainability's frontiers, examining the ontology, or the 'place', from where actors co-construct these conflicts. If actors don't question the reified and divided assumptions of the 'self' and 'reality' at the base of these conflicts, the creative and transformative potential of becoming together cannot unfold. The transformational learning approach is a coherent way of addressing this challenge, as it promotes an ontological change in actors and their worldview. The training experience offered by the University of Santiago provides insights into how transformational education's perspective can contribute to education in political ecology, inciting an acknowledgment of the self and the world as a complex and dynamic entanglement of actors.","[Paz Aedo, Maria] Univ Santiago Chile, GAMA, Santiago, Chile; [Schaeffer, Colombina] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile; [Peredo, Santiago] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile",,"Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Grp GAMA, Dept Gest Agr, Fac Tecnol, Santiago, Chile.; Peredo, S (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Programa Medio Ambiente & Soc, Santiago, Chile.",santiago.peredo@usach.cl,,,Universidad de Santiago de Chile [USA 155],This work was supported by Universidad de Santiago de Chile (Project USA 155).,,40,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

We found that the three scales in either survey (except Sense of Belonging to School in PISA) reached at least metric invariance. The scale scores from the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and the item response theory analysis were highly correlated, pointing to robustness of scaling methods. The correlations between each construct and achievement was generally positive within each culture in each survey, and the correlational pattern was similar across surveys (except for Sense of Belonging), indicating certain convergence in the cross-survey validation.

The present study was completed to explore this research domain further by investigating the impact of gender on static and animation presentations. In two experiments, university students were randomly assigned to either a static or animation condition and watched a computer-controlled presentation of a Lego shape being built. After each of two presentations, students were required to reconstruct the task followed by a transfer task. In Experiment 1 the tasks were performed using real Lego bricks (physical environment), and in Experiment 2 by computerized images of the bricks (virtual environment). Results indicated no differences between the two testing environments or an overall advantage for the animated format. However, a number of interactions between gender and presentation format were found.

Based on an unprecedented intervention in the area of music, this paper evaluates the impact of intensive participation of children and young at-risk students in the creation and development of the first youth orchestra of the municipality of Curanilahue, a small and poor county in the south of Chile, South America. After confronting many potential sources of selection bias in the impact estimation-self-selection, parents selection, orchestra selection, payment capacity-we found positive effects of this experience on participants at both the cognitive and socio-emotional levels. We found that orchestra participation positively affects both language and mathematics in SAT-like tests. The estimated impacts are in the upper bound of the impact evaluation sizes range in the developing world (e.g. Duflo et al., 2013; McEwan, 2012; Ganimian and Murnane, 2016). Furthermore, having analyzed the increase in test scores for those students participating in the orchestra who take the test more than once, we find results that indicate a progressive increase in their scores, both in mathematics and in language, an indicator that can be considered as a proxy of socio-emotional outcomes related to the orientation and persistence to obtain personal goals.","[Egana-delSol, Pablo] Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Egana-delSol, Pablo] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Contreras, Dante] Univ Chile, Ctr Social Conflict & Cohes Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pablo Valenzuela, Juan] Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",,"Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), Asia Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.; Egana-delSol, P (corresponding author), MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",pegana@mit.edu; dcontrer@econ.uchile.cl; jp.valenzuelab@gmail.com,,,"Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; Millennium Nucleus of Social Development - Millennium Scientific Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Chile); PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]","We would like to thank Jere Behrman, Cristian Bellei, Ernesto Trevino, Amanda Telias, Miguel Urquiola and Stephen Wu for their comments and suggestions on previous versions.

The purpose of this study was to gauge students' visual attention in their Mathematics and English classrooms. This article reports on a study conducted in three schools in Santiago, Chile, where a sample of 113 randomly selected students wore a mini-video camera mounted on eyeglass in their Mathematics and English lessons. Using Google images, we automatically and objectively examined 723,600 frames from the recordings where the classroom teacher appeared in the students' visual field. The results show that students' visual attention varies depending on four factors: (a) gender of the student, (b) age of the students, whether students are low/high attainers and (d) whether students are in English or Mathematics lessons. Surprisingly, students significantly paid more visual attention in their Mathematics than in English lessons. High attainers were more visually engaged than their low attainers counterparts. Students appeared to be visually engaged differently at different stages in their education. Furthermore, girls were more visually engaged than boys. The results of this study can have enormous practical implications for teachers and teacher education, in order to be better visually engaged with students during teaching.","[Farsani, Danyal] Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Radmehr, Farzad; Zakariya, Yusuf Feyisara] Univ Agder, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Math Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Radmehr, Farzad] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Teacher Educ Culture & Sport, Dept Language Literature Math & Interpreting, Bergen, Norway; [Alizadeh, Mohadaseh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Math Sci, Dept Appl Math, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran",,"Farsani, D (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Santiago, Chile.",danyal.farsani@gmail.com,"Zakariya, Yusuf F/G-2868-2017; Radmehr, Farzad/S-3150-2018","Zakariya, Yusuf F/0000-0002-5266-8227; Radmehr, Farzad/0000-0002-0592-9148; Farsani, Danyal/0000-0002-9412-3161; Alizadeh, Mohadeseh/0000-0002-9883-1835",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3170062],"ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: FB0003; FONDECYT, Grant/Award Number: 3170062",,49,1,2,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

This paper explores the discursive production of students with special educational needs in the context of professional development (PD) for collaborative problem-solving teaching. We held interviews with Chilean primary school teachers after their participation in PD and used a post-structural analysis to examine them. We turned to policy and institutional practices to understand the disability discourses that were evident. Teachers called on medical and deficit discourses to produce these students as abnormal and problematic in their learning of mathematics. Yet teachers also blurred the lines of categorisation between and within labels of special needs, including other students in these terms. Simultaneously, the reform PD created space for a counter discourse of ability. We suggest PD should help teachers of mathematics resist deficit discourses and see the ways in which experience may run contrary to them.","[Darragh, Lisa] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand; [Valoyes-Chavez, Luz] Univ Chile, CIAE, Santiago, Chile",,"Darragh, L (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Auckland, New Zealand.",l.darragh@auckland.ac.nz,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Darragh, Lisa/0000-0001-7723-1710; Valoyes-Chavez, Luz/0000-0001-6763-2094","CONICYT/FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160469, 3180238]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003]","The research reported in this paper was made possible by funding from the following funding sources: CONICYT/FONDECYT No. 3160469 and No. 3180238, and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003.",,48,6,6,2,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-1954,1573-0816,,EDUC STUD MATH,Educ.

In such systems, the actors are encouraged to strive for continuous development in learning organisations based on teamwork, distributed leadership, and professional learning communities. School leaders are positioned between district level administrators and teachers in such processes and have the responsibility to secure professional development. Using the implementation of the national program 'Assessment for Learning' in Norway as a case, the article shows that leaders approach professional development differently. Analyses of interviews with leaders from 7 schools reveal three distinct approaches related to how school leaders perceive knowledge. Some school leaders assume that teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills and trust them to manage the implementation process without leader support. Other school leaders distrust teachers' knowledge and skills and assume that the proper knowledge exists outside the school. These leaders seek external support when they meet teacher resistance. In a third approach, school leaders assume that knowledge develops through collaboration and thereby engage with teachers in continuous judgment about the implementation procedure. In the discussion, questions of trust and distrust are analysed in relation to how professional knowledge is developed and how professional discretion can support the development of intelligent accountability in schools.","[Tolo, Astrid] Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Bergen, Bergen, Norway; [Lillejord, Solvi] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Oxford, England; [Florez Petour, Maria Teresa] Univ Chile, Pedag Studies Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Hopfenbeck, Therese N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Univ Ctr Educ Assessment, Dept Educ, Oxford, England",,"Tolo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Educ, Bergen, Norway.",astrid.tolo@uib.no; solvi.lillejord@uib.no; mtflorez@u.uchile.cl; therese.hopfenbeck@education.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,94,3,3,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1389-2843,1573-1812,,J EDUC CHANG,J.

We undertook a classical thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews held with 10 primary school teachers 18months after their participation in PD. We present an innovative report of our findings by combining the interview analysis into a movie synopsis and creating a fictional protagonist, Tia (aunty' in Spanish), who represents the common findings from the ten teachers. We found the attractive identities performed by teachers, in particular the mother-saviour' and the successful' teacher, conflicted with their understandings of the teacher role promoted by PD. We argue the unique method of combining data allowed for reporting findings with both breadth and depth and this enabled us to see the way in which identities are culturally and contextually produced.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology was adopted via the case study method through which the case of a sixth-grade Chilean teacher participating in the study was documented. The data were collected through a lesson plan, a videotape of the implemented lesson and a questionnaire. A professional digital competence framework for teachers provided an analytical perspective via data analysis. Findings The results show that the teacher displayed digital competence in a synchronous collaborative learning environment in which she had time to reflect on the educational value of technology and appropriate teaching methods involving information and communication technologies. Certain elements of the studied case contributed to this performance, namely the cross-border context, the classroom setting and the collaborative Lesson Study methodology. Practical implications The lesson study methodology facilitated the teacher's performance in the Pedagogy and didactics digital competence by enabling her to participate in planning and implementing a lesson that allowed all those who collaborated, including teachers and researchers, to reflect on teaching in a digital learning environment. Social implications The cross-border context, which involved co-designing and implementing a lesson in two countries, allowed the teacher to display her School in society and Ethics competencies. This was achieved through connecting two classrooms with different languages and cultures digitally and synchronously, thereby providing students the opportunity to debate and participate in a global and local problem such as a country's responsibility for energy consumption. Originality/value Modern society requires the transformation of school practices, and new teaching approaches should include the provision of collaborative spaces that incorporate digital technologies. In this sense, this paper shows that cross-border lessons involving a synchronous learning environment offer a potential alternative, as digital teaching competence enables teachers to bring together different social and cultural groups virtually, thereby contributing to the reduction of social gaps and to the promotion of positive identity among less advantaged students.","[Isoda, Masami] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Estrella, Soledad; Zakaryan, Diana; Olfos, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Baldin, Yuriko] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Araya, Roberto] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Estrella, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",soledad.estrella@pucv.cl,"Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022","estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914; Araya, Roberto/0000-0003-2598-8994","ANID Fondecyt [1200346]; FONDEF [ID20i10070]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP19K21743, JP26245082]; VRIEA [039.439/2020]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]","The authors are thankful to the support from ANID Fondecyt 1200346; FONDEF ID20i10070; JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K21743, JP26245082; VRIEA 039.439/2020 and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003.",,25,2,2,7,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2046-8253,2016-8261,,INT J LESSON LEARN S,Int.

We identified two main areas of possible impact: the potential effects upon doctoral research projects and upon the doctoral students themselves. We followed the learning experiences of science and technology PhD students before, during, and a year after an entrepreneurial course through a multiple case study research design. Our results suggest that entrepreneurship education has a positive impact upon the development of student's creative problem-solving and communication skills. This was reported to have a generally positive effect upon the students' doctoral projects and on the student's self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions.

In a banked cloze test, the left side of the page shows a text with words deleted and replaced with blanks that are numbered, and the right side shows the word list with a space to write in the corresponding number. In Experiment 1, 56 fourth graders in the conventional group responded more slowly but just as accurately, and spent more time looking at the word list on the right of the screen but spent equivalent time looking at the text as compared to a group that took the test with an improved interface. In Experiment 2, the same pattern of results was replicated with 148 sixth graders and for each of three versions of improved interfaces as compared to the conventional interface.

The objective of this research is to learn more about teacher educators' perspectives on the efficacy of urban-based teacher education in preparing elementary school teachers for rural contexts. The research was undertaken in a city in the Araucania region of Chile. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the directors of three teacher education programmes. Those interviewed reported concerns about multi-grade classrooms often found in rural schools, which were understood to be an anomaly of proper elementary education. They also reported that the teacher education programmes they directed, though not aligned with teaching in rural schools, were sufficient in preparing new teachers. Preparation in teaching children in rural settings was not offered, or, in some cases, offered on the periphery as a programme option. This research reveals a disconnect between urban-based, urban-oriented teacher education programmes and the rural communities they aim to serve. It also adds to the broader discussion surrounding the preparation of teachers for diverse contexts.","[Silva-Pena, Ilich] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile; [Precht, Andrea] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social, Fac Educ, Curico, Chile; [O'Brien, Thomas, V] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Educ, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Jara, Carin] Univ Santo Tomas, Bogota, Colombia",,"Silva-Pena, I (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Educ, Inst Interuniv Invest Educ IESED Chile, Osorno, Chile.",ilichsp@gmail.com,"Precht, Andrea/H-4506-2015","Precht, Andrea/0000-0002-2435-5565; Silva-Pena, Ilich/0000-0001-9118-3989","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship [611.3]","This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico: [Grant Number, 1151447, 1181925]; Fulbright Scholarship 611.3.",,54,1,1,7,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-3116,1464-5173,,INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC,Int.

To analyze the relationship between institutional factors and within-school segregation, it uses a logistic regression, controlling for a set of school characteristics. This analysis finds that within-school segregation is related to institutional factors such as school size and the characteristics of their students. To determine the effects of within-school segregation on academic performance, a multilevel regression model is used, organized in three levels: school, classroom and student. The results show that within-school segregation has negative consequences on educational quality, efficiency and equity, since internal segregation reduces the average educational outcomes of the schools and mostly affects students of middle groups within the school in both academic achievement and socioeconomic terms.

To establish whether analogy making plays a role in this process of learning, we devised a classroom game based on an analysis of a number-line analogy that leverages children' spatial intuitions for helping them understand the numbers. To investigate the role of spatial positioning along the number line, seventy-seven preschoolers were randomly assigned to control tasks (control condition) or to embodied number line tasks in two possible spatial locations: watching numbers increasing either from left to right (space-number alignment condition) or from right to left (space-number misalignment condition) Performing-learning activities for roughly two hours promoted children's proficiency in four tasks of numerical knowledge, but only children under spatial and numerical alignment increased their proficiency in a task of number line estimation. This finding shows that the numerical representations generated by children during training were integrated with spatial information that was implicit in the learning activities, thus revealing that analogical alignments play a key role in the formation of early numerical representations. Additionally, this study illustrates that interrogating the analogy at the foundation of an instructional activity highlights key instructional decisions that can have a large impact on learning. Future research along this line might provide a framework for using analogy at the foundations of instructional design.","[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile; [Gomez, David M.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ, Rancagua, Chile; [Dartnell, Pablo] Univ Chile, CIAE, CMM, Periodista Jose Carrasco Tapia 75, Santiago, Chile",,"Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Av Andres Bello 720, Chillan 3800708, Chile.",jnavarrete@ubiobio.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751; Gomez, David/0000-0001-9509-6436","INNOVA-BIO-BIO [13.1984-EM.CIE, 14.541-EM.CIE]; Universidad del Bio-Bio [124009 3/D]; FAPEI Fund; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB0003, PFB03]; CONICYT/PIA Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003, PFB03]","This research was supported by the INNOVA-BIO-BIO grants 13.1984-EM.CIE and 14.541-EM.CIE.

International evidence suggests that these gender differences reflect gender inequities in educational and economic opportunities available in a given culture. A theoretical model suggests that sociocultural factors such as gender stereotype and math anxiety have an impact on women's math abilities by affecting their skills for cognitive reflection. This cross-sectional study collected data from 259 university students to gather preliminary evidence on the close relationship between gender gaps in math achievement and gender gaps in cognitive reflection. A mediation analysis shows that the level of cognitive reflection of students fully mediates the effect of gender on math achievement, even after controlling for participants' linguistic abilities. These findings support the possibility that there is a close relationship between gender differences in cognitive reflection and gender gaps in math achievement at university admission in Chile. The discussion emphasizes that the university admission's data is under the control of state agencies with strict protocols of information access that undermines the feasibility of researching this area. Assessments of cognitive reflection are easy to administer in only a few minutes and under laboratory conditions. Hence, one way to boost the viability of research and diagnosis of gender gaps in Chile is to use cognitive reflection assessments as proximal estimates for gender gaps in math performance at university admission.","[Navarrete, Jairo A.] Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Ctr Estudios Nuble, Chillan, Chile; [Sandoval-Diaz, Jose S.] Univ Bio Bio, Grp Invest Genero Ciudadania & Equidad GI 170424, Chillan, Chile",,"Navarrete, JA (corresponding author), Univ OHiggins, Inst Ciencias Educ ICEd, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 611, Rancagua, Chile.",jairo.navarrete@uoh.cl; jsandoval@ubiobio.cl,"Sandoval-D’az, JosŽ/AAT-3262-2021","Sandoval-D’az, JosŽ/0000-0001-7247-7113; Navarrete, Jairo A./0000-0002-2785-2751",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [19I10030],"This research was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) del Gobierno de Chile, by funding of Program FONDEF Grant ID19I10030.",,62,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2890,1573-1928,,SOC PSYCHOL EDUC,Soc.

This tendency has resulted in cannabis consumption being accepted by society as if it were harmless. However, evidence shows that the use of this drug has detrimental effects on cognitive, academic, and professional performance, which tend to be larger in younger users (e.g., high school students). In this review article, we focus on the decline of visuospatial processing associated with cannabis consumption in nondependent or nonclinical high school students. We start by providing evidence of the pivotal role of visuospatial processing for learning. Next, we review experimental and correlational evidence of declines in visuospatial processing related to cannabis use. Three types of correlational studies are considered: (a) comparisons of declines between visuospatial processing and other cognitive tasks, (b) studies comparing declines between high school students and adult participants, and (c) stringent correlational studies (e.g., large samples, longitudinal data, twin studies). We also include evidence in abstinent cannabis conditions. We conclude that using cannabis may moderately impair visuospatial processing and learning in nondependent high school students, although the effects could disappear under abstinence and tend to be lower than on other cognitive functions. Instructional implications for educators and future research directions are discussed.","[Goycolea, Rodrigo] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Santiago, Chile; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Dorr, Anneliese] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat & Mental Hlth, Santiago, Chile",,"Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.",rodrigo.goycolea@ucentral.cl; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; adorr@med.uchile.cl,,"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255],Funding received was from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255.,,74,0,0,1,10,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

The results showed that learning and school problems were able to predict 16% (F = 6.416; p = .000; R-a(2) = 0.16) of self-esteem variance. It seems that students who present difficulties in their learning process are more vulnerable to not appreciating their qualities and feeling less proud of themselves, which could decrease their self-esteem.

This paper presents the background, methods and results of a new simulation management game called LEBSCO, which simulates aspects of the Last Planner System (LPS) and Lean Production principles. LPS is central to the implementation of Lean Construction, an increasingly popular management approach based on the Toyota Production System and Lean Production. LPS requires continuous and collaborative effort from all stakeholders for the planning and control of a construction project, making it especially appropriate for the experiential learning allowed by simulation. LEBSCO consists of the assembly of Lego pieces to form a schematic house, and it is played by teams meeting in rounds simulating weeks of work. Each team is composed of stakeholders, such as a planner, resource suppliers and trade foremen, mirroring the planning and control process of a typical construction project. Participants build the Lego houses first using a Traditional management approach and then using Lean-based approach. A graduate course in construction management at The University of Auckland, New Zealand, is used as a case study to test the effectiveness of LEBSCO as a teaching method. The implementation results of LESBCO demonstrated its capability to transfer and disseminate Lean-based knowledge into construction.

Consequently, the influence of the clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students' intrinsic motivation. The aim of this study was to describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. MethodsA qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. FindingsSeveral themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and constructive feedback; delivery of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. ConclusionsOur findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomy-supportive style to motivate their patients.","[Orsini, C.; Evans, P.; Binnie, V.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, FEN, Teaching & Learning Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Ledezma, P.; Fuentes, F.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Santiago, Chile",,"Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, 27 Hillhead St, Glasgow G12 8PX, Lanark, Scotland.",corsini@fen.uchile.cl,"Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019","Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-2087-6662",,,,45,19,20,1,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

However, current efforts do not provide a comprehensive view of the way their students learn music before starting university. The objective of this study is to portray their musical experiences, identifying the distinctive mechanisms underlying the relationship between practices, repertoires, and training contexts for music learning. A combination of pedagogical, social and musical dimensions, inspired by sociological theories of P. Bourdieu and B. Bernstein, examine the pre-university musical experiences and the mediating role of students' sociocultural origins. Empirically, multimodal information from four Chilean universities (n = 55) was collected through the application of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed using a set of mixed techniques, including descriptive statistics, text mining, and content analysis. Findings reveal relevant associations between practices, repertoires, and learning contexts, especially in terms of the specialized nature of musical training and the habitus and cultural dispositions of practitioners. Particularly relevant is the predominance of informal and non-formal learning contexts and their translation into specific types of learning. These challenge current perspectives and contribute a tool kit for the understanding of the relationship between power and knowledge in future professional teachers.","[Poblete, Carlos; Carreno, Barbara] Univ OHiggins, Rancagua, Chile; [Leguina, Adrian] Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Masquiaran, Nicolas] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",,"Leguina, A (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci, Quantitat Social Sci, Brockington Bldg, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",A.Leguina@lboro.ac.uk,"Leguina, Adrian/AAX-6455-2020; ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020","Leguina, Adrian/0000-0002-9229-2033;",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003],Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.,,46,3,4,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0255-7614,1744-795X,,INT J MUSIC EDUC,Int.

To isolate preferences for those goods, we implement an online discrete choice experiment using social statistics generated from true variation among commuting zones. We find that, ceteris paribus, the average income that individuals are willing to sacrifice is (1) $4,984 to increase higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation (14 percent); (2) $1,168 to decrease rich/poor gaps in higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation (8 percent); and (3) $2,900 to decrease the 90/10 income inequality ratio by 1 standard deviation (1.66). In addition, we find that political affiliation is an important moderator of preferences for equality. While both Democrats and Republicans are willing to trade over $4,000 to increase higher education enrollment by 1 standard deviation, Democrats are willing to sacrifice nearly three times more income to decrease either rich/poor gaps in higher education enrollment or the 90/10 income inequality ratio by 1 standard deviation.","[Lara, Bernardo] Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Shores, Kenneth A.] Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Lara, B (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile.; Shores, KA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",blara@utalca.cl; kshores@psu.edu,"Lara, Bernardo/Q-8092-2019","Shores, Kenneth/0000-0003-3039-420X",,,,43,0,0,0,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The aim is to establish a standardized, compatible and flexible European university system that enables graduates and undergraduates to move easily from one institution to another within Europe. As a result of evaluation mechanisms, the system will be transparent and of high quality, which will make it attractive and competitive internationally in a globalized world. In this paper, we focus on two distance learning modes that will become more important as a result of this change in universities: e-learning and b-learning. These basically involve the virtualization of learning processes through the use of computer equipment. We carried out a qualitative study using the case study method. The results indicate that teaching staff use information and communication technology (ICT) to improve student learning. Similarly, a high percentage (78%) of lecturers use some form of digital platform as a support for teaching. In conclusion, training policies should strengthen university teachers' skills in the use of ICT equipment, tools and resources related to blended and virtual learning.","[Imbernon Munoz, Francisco] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Fac Pedag, Barcelona, Spain; [Guzman Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Munoz, FI (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Fac Pedag, Barcelona, Spain.",fimbernon@ub.edu; patriciasilva@ub.edu; carolina.guzman@uv.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020; Silva, Patricia PS/D-7149-2017; Imbern—n, Francisco FIM/K-5356-2014","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X; Silva, Patricia PS/0000-0001-5651-296X; Imbern—n, Francisco FIM/0000-0001-7566-6358",,,,31,45,45,3,58,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2011,18,36,,,,,107,114,,10.3916/C36-2011-03-01,,,8,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,716RY,WOS:000286992400013,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Estatal,comunicar,Q1

The latter was based on the self-determination theory's concepts of differentiation of autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation. MethodsA cross-sectional correlational study was conducted where 924 students completed self-reported questionnaires measuring motivation, perception of the learning climate, feedback and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha scores and bivariate correlations were computed. Mediation of basic needs on each predictor-outcome association was tested based on a series of regression analyses. Finally, all variables were integrated into one structural equation model, controlling for the effects of age, gender and year of study. ResultsCronbach's alpha scores were acceptable (.655 to .905). Correlation analyses showed positive and significant associations between both an autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback received, and students' autonomous motivation, which decreased and became negative when correlated with controlled motivation and amotivation, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that these associations were indirect and mediated by how these predictors satisfied students' basic psychological needs. These results were corroborated by the structural equation analysis, in which data fit the model well and regression paths were in the expected direction. ConclusionAn autonomy-supportive learning climate and the quantity and quality of feedback were positive predictors of students' autonomous motivation and negative predictors of amotivation. However, this was an indirect association mediated by the satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs. Consequently, supporting students' needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness might lead to optimal types of motivation, which has an important influence on dental education.","[Orsini, C.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile; [Orsini, C.] Univ Chile, Teaching & Learning Ctr, FEN, Santiago, Chile; [Binnie, V.; Wilson, S.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Med Dent & Nursing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,"Orsini, C (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Santiago, Chile.",cesar.orsini@gmail.com,"Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019","Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Binnie, Vivian/0000-0002-8610-6812",Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream,Association for Dental Education in Europe's 40th Anniversary Scholarship Award-General Stream 2015-2016,,41,13,13,4,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Objectives This study's main objectives were to determine whether the curriculum and the faculty teaching practices of the School of Dentistry at the University of Chile contribute to its students' commitment to ethical and social responsibility. Methods This was a qualitative study that investigated the perceptions of sixteen subjects (eight students and eight faculty members). Data were collected in thorough deep interviews. The interview process model conceptualised and organised the information into sets of dimensions and categories. The dimensions studied were ethical commitment and social responsibility. The categories assessed within ethical commitment were honesty, tolerance, responsibility and respect. In the social responsibility dimension, the categories were solidarity, teamwork and concern for and communication with the patient. Analysis of the textual data was performed using a method of content analysis based upon constructed qualitative matrices. Results Our results show that students and scholars alike realise that ethical commitment and a sense of social responsibility are not promoted in the curriculum. They do, however, recognise the importance of these qualities in dental practitioners. Conclusions These results indicate that the current curriculum and teaching practices used in our School of Dentistry need to be reviewed and that programmes promoting professionals' commitment to their role in society need to be implemented.","[Gonzalez, F.

Implementing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that repeating an early grade in primary school decreases the probability of committing a crime as a juvenile by 14.5 percentage points. By estimating and simulating a dynamic model, we show that the RD result is mainly driven by two mechanisms related to the timing of grade retention. First, grade retention in early grades decreases the probability of grade retention in late primary school grades. Second, late grade retention in primary education has a positive and more relevant effect on crime than the direct effect in early grades. Our findings support the argument that, conditional on the decision to keep grade retention as an ongoing policy, the optimal implementation at the margin is to retain students in early grades in order to avoid retention in later ones.","[Diaz, Juan] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management Control & Informat Syst, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Nicolas; Rivera, Jorge] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes, Tatiana] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Grau, N (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",juadiaz@fen.uchile.cl; ngrau@fen.uchile.cl; tatiana_reyes@berkeley.edu; jrivera@econ.uchile.cl,,,,,,39,0,0,6,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

A quantitative methodology, with a representative sample of 568 students (N=273 from Chile and N=295 from Uruguay) was designed and implemented. TDC was also studied and discussed in relation to gender and educational level. Results showed a mostly basic level for the four dimensions of the TDC in the sample. Regarding the relationship between the variables and the TDC, the Planning, organization and management of spaces and technological resources' dimension is the only one showing significant differences. In particular, male students achieved a higher TDC level compared with female students. Furthermore, the proportion of Primary Education students with a low TDC level was significantly higher than other students.

This characteristic led international organizations to promote the Chilean policies in different contexts in Latin America and beyond. In 2006, a high school student movement occupied public and private schools, demystifying the outcomes of these policies. A new wave of demonstrations took place in 2011, with a college student leadership that paralyzed a significant amount of universities and schools throughout the country. After both waves of mobilizations, the political system opened the process of policy-making that considered the demands of social movements.

We use census data from a parent questionnaire in Chile, a country with a national school choice and competition system, to describe the attributes most commonly considered by parents when choosing a school, and to assess how the probability of prioritizing those attributes varies with the parents socioeconomic characteristics, while controlling for other characteristics of the family. We find that parents choosing a school prioritize its proximity, its quality, and whether it provides religious education. Furthermore, the probability of parents prioritizing proximity is higher for parents of low socioeconomic status, while the probability of them prioritizing quality and religious education is higher for parents of high socioeconomic status. These findings show that only advantaged families choose schools based on their quality, and therefore school choice and competition policies may offer a limited benefit for disadvantaged pupils, possibly maintaining or reinforcing socioeconomic segregation in the education system.","[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [Gelber, Denisse] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Tellez Canas, Santiago] Univ Externado Colombia, Bogota, Colombia",,"Hofflinger, A (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile.",alvaro.hofflinger@ufrontera.cl; dgelber@uc.cl; santiago.tellez@uexternado.edu.co,,"Gelber, Denisse/0000-0001-6073-5808","National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007, REDI 170019]","We are grateful for the funds provided by the National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [CONICYT PIA CIE160007 and REDI 170019], which contributed to this research.",,61,5,5,5,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

The school competition theory holds that achievement rises when students can choose among competing schools. The school resources theory holds that achievement rises with schools' resources per student. The family resources theory holds that achievement rises as parents become more educated and earn higher incomes. We test all three theories in Chile between 2002 and 2013, when reading and math scores rose by 0.2 to 0.3 standard deviations, as school competition, school resources, and family resources all increased. We compare Chilean municipalities in a difference-in-differences analysis, asking whether test scores rose fastest in municipalities with greater increases in school competition, school resources, or family resources. We find that municipal test scores did not rise with school competition but did rise with family resources (parental education, not income) and, to a smaller extent, with school resources (as measured by class sizes). Results favor the family resource theory, and to a lesser extent the school resource theory, but not the school competition theory.","[Hofflinger, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Temuco, Chile; [von Hippel, Paul T.] Univ Texas Austin, Publ Policy Sociol Stat & Data Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"von Hippel, PT (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, 2315 Red River,Box Y, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",paulvonhippel.utaustin@gmail.com,,,,,,61,3,3,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0038-0407,1939-8573,,SOCIOL EDUC,Sociol.

Aspects of the course design which were considered particularly effective were the use of scaffolded assessment, the application of threshold concepts, and well-structured collaborative learning activities paired with quality tutors. The key learning for the authors from the evaluation of the course was that while the tools and strategies developed were very useful, interweaving these tools into year 2 and 3 courses would help students see the ongoing value of critical thinking in their work.","[Whiley, Dona; Witt, Bradd; Colvin, R.

Two factors were assessed: the level of admissions selectivity by the university attended, and the salary received once employed. The participants graduated from three universities in Chile, one public and two private selected as representing three levels of university selectivity. The sample was constructed by random selection among five cohorts of graduates, from 2012 to 2016. A self-report questionnaire was administered on two occasions, in 2015 for the first three cohorts and in 2017 for the last two. The obtained sample included 587 graduates, in Psychology and in Teaching of Basic Education. The results reveal that selectivity is related to graduates' satisfaction with their university experience; the more selective the university in which they are admitted, the more graduates are satisfied. Salary, on the other hand, is related to satisfaction only in the case of the least selective university. The findings provide some directions for how universities can improve graduates' satisfaction.","[Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Tarapaca, Chile; [Gonzalez, Luis Eduardo; Loyola, Javier; Castillo, Dante] Programa Interdisciplinario Invest Educ PIIE, Santiago, Chile; [Sandoval, Luis] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana UTEM, Santiago, Chile; [McGinn, Noel] Harvard Univ, Sch Educ, Swampscott, MA USA",,"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Tarapaca, Fac Educ & Humanidades, Tarapaca, Chile.",oespinoza@academia.cl,"; Espinoza, Oscar/G-5839-2019","Castillo, Dante/0000-0002-5648-0627; McGinn, Noel/0000-0001-7132-2136; LOYOLA, JAVIER/0000-0001-8336-6873; Sandoval, Luis/0000-0001-9452-4945; Espinoza, Oscar/0000-0001-7525-2980",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1151016],This research was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) through the FONDECYT Project No1151016.

Yet we know little about the politics of improving education. One significant and instructive case of reforms designed to boost education quality comes from Chile, where in 2016 the government enacted a sweeping reform of teaching careers. This paper first uses a quantitative analysis of appearances in the news to identify key stakeholders and then turns to process tracing to analyze how and when these stakeholders influenced reform dynamics. Comparatively, the Chilean case differs from similar reforms elsewhere in Latin America due to the absence of business, the strong role of policy networks, and the final negotiated settlement with the teacher union. Theoretically, the analysis confirms general theories that emphasize the roles of distributive politics and policy networks.","[Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Schneider, Ben] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schneider, Ben] Stellenbosch Univ, Stellenbosch Inst Adv Study STIAS, Wallenberg Res Ctr, Stellenbosch, South Africa",,"Schneider, B (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",brs@mit.edu,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013","Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677; Schneider, Ben/0000-0001-9227-7805",,,,59,6,6,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

Data on situational interest and ongoing classroom activities were obtained using the experience sampling method, with measurements taken three times during a lesson. The process yielded a total of 1717 measurements in the Finnish schools and 1767 in the Chilean schools. Multilevel regression analyses with mixed effects and random intercept were conducted. Results showed a positive effect of scientific practices that required asking questions, designing scientific inquiry and interpreting data on situational interest. Student collaborative situations were more interesting for Chilean students than for Finnish ones.

As an outcome of our review and analysis, a set of recommendations to strengthen the elaboration of reliable and valid research studies is provided. Changes are needed in order to foment meta-research, open science practices and replication studies; notably, changes are needed in the instruction of research methods; in the use and interpretation of statistical data, as well as in research culture in general.

The aims of this research were twofold: to identify the participants' perceptions about reading and writing in Mapuzugun and to analyze the pedagogical practices involving literacy in the classroom. Results show that literacy is not a central aspect in beliefs of the traditional educators charged with teaching the intercultural curriculum, despite there being a wide range of literacy practices displayed in the classrooms.

The notion that interactants can modify their affective output in such fashion is referred in the literature as affective alignment (Ochs, 1988). By using linguistic anthropological methods, audio and video recordings of naturally occurring conversation involving 17 students and two teachers were analyzed for the use of verbal and non-verbal affective behavior. The analysis showed that students actively participated in an on-going negotiation of affective practices with their teachers. Moreover, learning the heritage language was related to and dependent upon other affective factors beyond students' immediate educational and instructional need. These findings provide us with a better understanding of the influence of the teachers' and students' affective behavior on one another, and on students' acquisition of their heritage language.

This study explores the educational inclusion of girls in mathematics classrooms. The coding of videos from 79 school lessons, involving 2,295 students, allowed us to compare how and how much teachers interact with male and female students, analyse the moderating effect of academic achievement in these interactions and explore the differences among classrooms with regard to the inclusion of girls. Teacher-student interaction networks were represented via sociograms and modelled with multilevel Poisson regression. We found that girls interact less frequently with their mathematics teachers in interactions of diverse content, and this is the case in interactions initiated by the teacher as well as those initiated by the student. Academic achievement moderates these differences only in pedagogical interactions initiated by students. There is also significant variation in the inclusion of girls among classrooms, which is not consistently explained by the gender of the teacher or the gender composition of the class.","[Ortega, Lorena] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Trevino, Ernesto; Gelber, Denisse] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Ortega, L (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Estudios Avanzados Educ IE, CIAE, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",lorena.ortega@ie.uchile.cl,"Ortega, Lorena/P-1879-2018","Ortega, Lorena/0000-0002-6471-0277","Chilean National Research and Development Agency [ANID Projects] [PIA CIE160007, FONDECYT INICIACION 11190591]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]",This study was funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency [ANID Projects PIA CIE160007 and FONDECYT INICIACION 11190591].

A sample of 1684 university students in New Zealand participated in this study. Students' responses to an open-ended question were first inductively coded and then quantitatively analyzed using Chi-square independence test and logistic regression. The findings identified several situational, dispositional, and institutional factors that hinder student learning, among them financial difficulties and work commitments, health, and family issues were more dominant. These factors are perceived differently by students of different disciplines and ethnicities. For instance, Asian students were less likely to refer to financial difficulties and work commitments compared to the other ethnicities, whereas Pasifika and then Maori students perceived family issues more than other ethnic groups. STEM major students were more likely to believe the teaching quality restricts their learning than their non-STEM counterparts.

However, its implementation into the curricula of dental schools is still limited. Our objective was to identify the main values related to professionalism based on the perceptions of students and faculty members from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile. Methods A Dental Values Survey was validated and culturally adapted in order to guarantee the greatest possible internal validity. The adapted survey was administered to students and faculty members (416 and 225, respectively). The final survey contained 64 items rated on a Likert scale of 1-5. Each item was categorised according to five dimensions: Altruism, Consciousness, Personal Satisfaction, Quality of Life and Professional Status. The values were compared between faculty and students and among students at different courses. A values scale was constructed by selecting the five items with the highest average score for each dimension. Results Survey respondents composed 34.32% of the universe, of which 50.46% were faculty and 49.54% were students. Values associated with Altruism, Consciousness and Professional Status, were the highest rated by students and faculty. Values associated with Personal Satisfaction and Quality of Life received the lowest scores for both groups. Conclusions To provide the best possible attention to patients (Consciousness), and that patients have access to affordable dental care (Altruism), are the values at the top of our scale.

As these events involve multiple victims, their identities must be confirmed using the highest possible quality standards. Forensic Odontology (FO) has proven to be a scientific resource for disaster victim identification (DVI) procedures; however, it is highly dependent on the proper management not only of material resources but also of human resources. Chile is a country recognised as prone to natural disasters, but an insufficient number of forensic odontologists has been reported. The aim of the study was to review the literature on a dental undergraduate (UG) student's potential value in a DVI process. Methodology A scoping review was performed using a specific search strategy in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO and EBSCO databases. Results The search identified 27 articles in which the basic dental degree, the necessary training and the need for human resources are variables considered in different priorities by those articles. Discussion It is vital to assess the local needs of Chile based on its UGs, considering that FO is an underestimated resource that should be included early on in dental curriculums. Furthermore, it should align with public policies to ensure viability and inclusion in standardised protocols. Conclusion Although there is potential usage of UG dental students in DVI is not ideal, circumstances will dictate their use. The better trained they are as students, the more valuable their potential contribution will be.","[Salazar-Valenzuela, Luis; Lopez-Lazaro, Sandra; Fonseca, Gabriel M.] Univ La Frontera, Fac Odontol, Programa Magister Odontol, Temuco, Chile; [Salazar-Valenzuela, Luis; Lopez-Lazaro, Sandra; Fonseca, Gabriel M.] Univ La Frontera, Fac Odontol, Ctr Invest Odontol Legal & Forense CIO, Temuco, Chile; [Lopez-Lazaro, Sandra] Univ Chile, Dept Antropol, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Esteban Aguayo-Cadiz, Jose] Univ Arturo Prat, Fac Ciencias Salud, Carrera Odontol, Iquique, Chile; [Capitaneanu, Cezar] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Imaging & Pathol, Forens Odontol, Leuven, Belgium; [Capitaneanu, Cezar] Forens Odontol Mass Disaster & Human Rights FOMDA, Cork, Ireland",,"Fonseca, GM (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Fac Dent, Francisco Salazar 01145, Temuco 4780000, Chile.",gabriel.fonseca@ufrontera.cl,,"Capitaneanu, Cezar/0000-0001-7830-5718",RED ESTATAL DE ODONTOLOGIA Chile [REO19-011],"Supported in part by the RED ESTATAL DE ODONTOLOGIA Chile, project REO19--011",,64,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

It is characterized by tissue fragility, joint hypermobility and a wide range of articular and non-articular manifestations, which often appear in infancy. The clinical picture of EDS-HT/JHS is poorly known by the medical community, as is the presence of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) problems in affected children. Aim: The present work reviews the clinical and empirical evidence for ESSENCE difficulties in children with EDS-HT/1E1S. Method: A narrative review of the literature was undertaken following a comprehensive search of scientific online databases and reference lists. This included publications of quantitative and qualitative research. Results: Motor abnormality, hyperactivity/hypoactivity, inattention, speech/language, social interaction, behavioral, sleep, feeding and emotional problems are ESSENCE difficulties for which there is some evidence of an association with EDS-HT/JHS. Conclusion: Children with EDS-HT/JHS present ESSENCE problems that often coexist and tend to be recognized before the HDCT. Clinicians encountering children with ESSENCE problems should consider the possibility of an underlying HDCT such as EDS-HT/JHS, probably influencing neurodevelopmental attributes in a subgroup of children. Awareness of these interconnected clinical problems might help improve early referral, diagnosis and treatment of EDS-HT/JHS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been conceptualized in this article using a framework depicting the affects of these shifts on learning environments that may change schooling and impact society. These trends provide new challenges for educational researchers at national and international levels, requiring attention to the interrelationships among the various components in an educational system. New evidence, which builds on earlier claims of an increasing digital divide between developing and developed countries, has shown that this phenomenon is much more complex than was previously thought. We suggest that a promising way to maximize the knowledge and impact of researching IT in education is to establish longitudinal programmatic research sustained through the establishment of E-learning observatories, which can bring together expertise across a range of disciplines. A major challenge in forming a clear and coherent strategy for researching IT in education lies in the fact that there are multiple stakeholders with differing aims, goals and objectives. Therefore, reciprocal relationships are needed in which practice informs research and research informs practice with support and guidance from policymakers.","[Cox, M.

There were both high expectancies that technology could revolutionize education as well as divergent voices that doubted the real impact of technology on learning. This paper presents an evaluation of the Enlaces network, a national Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and education initiative designed as part of a series of programs to overcome inequity and quality issues of public education in Chile, by integrating teachers and learners into the knowledge society. Data gathered and the results obtained in four major areas of educational policies - infrastructure, digital literacy, conditions of learning, and the impact on school learning of major national and international tests are presented and fully analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of Enlaces as a visible component of the educational system and educational reform are also discussed. Enlaces has provided basic infrastructure tools, connectivity, ICTs, and teacher training to a huge number of schools, but critical results are narrow in terms of classroom learning and no additional, competencies have been observed.

A Course Management System (CMS), according to Social Constructivism framework, is an opportunity for fostering learning through interaction in a virtual environment for learning; hence, stimulating the use of a CMS for communication purposes seems quite appropriate. A quantitative analysis of 63.06% of the virtual classrooms was conducted, using the users log database to describe five variables: Participation, Informational Interaction Level, Communicational Interaction Level, and the use of Informational Resources and Communicational Resources in the CMS. An assessment of the first 2 years of implementation of Moodle in a campus confirmed prominence levels of interaction and resources that favor Information over Communication purposes in the use of the CMS. It is not conclusive whether this necessarily implies more or better learning; a profound qualitative study would be needed to answer these questions. Teachers and students show different behaviors in the face of this new ICT campus resource, while faculty members appear to have behaved in an erratic manner, students show steady levels of CMS usage.

However, their appearance and growth pathways have had significant disparities. Design/methodology/approach Global and local agendas have had a strong influence on Chilean higher education institutions. A relevant signal has been the creation of the SCN, formed by 21 Chilean universities, whose vision is to help shape a fair and environmentally healthy civilization contributing from the higher education realm. This work adopts a survey design methodological approach. It describes the following resulting components obtained from the aggregated data: (a) emergence processes and environments, (b) governance models and operational mechanisms, (c) networks and collaboration, and (d) final products generated, for sustainability governing entities within universities in Chile. Findings The main findings indicate that at the institutional level, the Cleaner Production Agreement for higher education institutions and the creation of the SCN have been key drivers in the formalization of several entities leading the sustainability efforts within Chilean universities. Also, regarding the degree of commitment to sustainability, the most active internal stakeholder corresponds to students. Originality/value The present work represents a pioneering effort in the Chilean context to identify and systematize the challenges, organizational structures, and key accomplishments of sustainability governing entities in higher education nationwide.","[Mac-lean, Claudia; Aldea, Cristian] Univ Magallanes, GAIA Antarctic Res Ctr, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Vargas, Luis Santiago] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Vargas, Luis Santiago] Inst Sistemas Complejos Ingn ISCI, Santiago, Chile; [Uribe, Gonzalo] Univ Magallanes, Outreach, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Aldea, Cristian] Univ Magallanes, Dept Sci & Nat Resources, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Lares, Lorna] Univ Chile, Ind Design Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Mercado, Oscar] Metropolitan Technol Univ, Sustainabil Program, Santiago, Chile",,"Mac-lean, C (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, GAIA Antarctic Res Ctr, Punta Arenas, Chile.",clau.maclean.b@gmail.com; lvargasd@ing.uchile.cl; gonzalo.uribe@umag.cl; cristian.aldea@umag.cl; lolares@uchilefau.cl; omercado@utem.cl,"vargas, luis/A-2109-2011","vargas, Luis/0000-0001-6539-1768",CONICYT PIA/BASALComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL [AFB180003],The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from CONICYT PIA/BASAL AFB180003.,,29,0,0,2,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

Il s'agit d'une experience educative developpee par un groupe de professeurs dans un quartier peripherique de Santiago du Chili. Cette initiative s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un mouvement syndical, social et pedagogique, le Mouvement de Consolidation de l'Education Publique. L'article a pour objet de visibiliser la constitution de la categorie sujet enseignant' dans cette experience particuliere. L'origine du mouvement se situe dans les principes definis par un mouvement educatif des premieres decades du XXeme siecle. L'experience a ete reconnue et valorisee, sous certains aspects, par la politique experimentale du Ministere de l'Education de la Republique du Chili. La proposition educative dont rend compte cette experience a reussi a s'inserer dans un processus social de transformations plus globales: des enfants et adolescents qui vivaient dans des conditions de vulnerabilite ont accede peu a peu au systeme scolaire, parvenant meme, dans certains cas, a s'incorporer a l'education superieure. Pour reconstruire les evenements historiques, on a eu recours a l'histoire orale, a travers des entretiens avec cinq professeurs protagonistes de cette experience. L'analyse de l'experience permet de montrer que la categorie sujet enseignant' emerge de l'articulation de quatre dimensions interdependantes, a savoir: la communaute, la politique educative, les pairs et la salle de classe. On en conclut que, dans des conjonctures historiques determinees, les sujets enseignants' creent de nouvelles pratiques dans tous ces domaines, qui transforment le systeme educatif. La possibilite se manifeste alors de construire un systeme educatif comptant sur la participation de la communaute educative, incorporant la culture locale et coherente a un projet de transformation sociale nationale.

Using a conceptual history approach allowed us to analyse the meanings attributed to the concept of quality in the design and implementation of two evaluation systems: The Educational Quality Assessment System (SECE, Spanish initials) and the Educational Quality Measurement System (SIMCE, Spanish initials). The findings show a transformation in meaning for the concept of quality. It moved from the operationalisation, management, and improvement of school systems to equating quality with the results of educational evaluations. This new definition of quality resulted from decisions by the Chilean State, which simplified its complexity and helped manage the new school system. An implication of this semantic transformation is the understanding of quality as a tool used to rank schools.","[Galioto, Carmelo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile; [Perez Navarro, Camila] Univ OHiggins, Inst Educ Sci, Rancagua, Chile",,"Galioto, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile.",cgalioto@uc.cl,,,,,,76,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-9230,1477-674X,,PAEDAGOG HIST,Paedagog.

A meta-analysis was conducted of scientifically rigorous experiments comparing the learning outcomes (i.e., performance on memory and/or comprehension tests) of students (i.e., college students and/or K-12 students) who read an academic text with or without being asked to highlight important material (i.e., with or without learner-generated highlighting) or who read an academic text with or without the important material already being highlighted (i.e., with or without instructor-provided highlighting). We found 36 published articles that met these criteria ranging from the years 1938 to 2019, which generated 85 effect sizes. The results showed that learner-generated highlighting improved memory but not comprehension, with average effect sizes of 0.36 and 0.20, respectively; and instructor-provided highlighting improved both memory and comprehension, both with an average effect size of 0.44. Learner-generated highlighting improved learning for college students but not for school students, with average effect sizes of 0.39 and 0.24, respectively; and instructor-provided highlighting improved learning for both college and school students, with average effect sizes of 0.41 and 0.48, respectively.

However, it is not clear what school-related factors most contribute to explaining students' perception of school safety, and how they relate to community-related factors such as neighborhood safety. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors associated with Chilean elementary and middle school students' perceptions of school safety. We used a sample of 5,455 students from low socioeconomic status public schools, and analyzed the predictive value of peer physical and verbal victimization; teacher and school staff victimization; teacher's social support; and perception of safety in the students' neighborhoods on perceptions of school safety. Findings showed that although different forms of school violence, particularly peer physical victimization and physical and sexual victimization from teachers and school staff, contribute to students' perception of school safety, the highest contribution came from students perceiving their neighborhoods as unsafe. In contrast, teacher social support contributed to increased levels of perceived school safety. We discuss the need for school-based interventions that address physical victimization and engage teachers in prosocial and less punitive approaches to foster a positive and safe school climate, and in fostering school-community partnerships.","[Lopez, Veronica; Ascorra, Paula; Morales, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Lopez, Veronica; Ascorra, Paula; Morales, Macarena] Ctr Res Inclus Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Torres-Vallejos, Javier] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos-Parada, Boris; Carrasco, Claudia] Univ Playa Ancha, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gilreath, Tamika D.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bilbao, Marian] Univ Santiago Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Av El Bosque, Sausalito 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",veronica.lopez@pucv.cl,"Carrasco, Claudia/AAF-6848-2021; Bilbao, M.

Indeed, curricula have already been developed that, through tailored support for peer argumentation. promote both content knowledge and argumentation skills simultaneously. However, we do not yet know how to optimize the occurrence of peer argumentation, although there are suggestions in the literature that computers may have a role to play. Likewise, there are uncertainties about the mechanisms through which the benefits of peer argumentation are achieved, especially whether (and how) there is interdependence across the two types of benefit. In this paper, we report a quasi-experimental study randomized at class level, which addresses these two issues. A total of 502 fourth-grade students and 20 classes and teachers covered a module in science under three conditions: (1) using a curriculum that was already known to promote peer argumentation and content knowledge (standard support). (2) using the same curriculum but with additional computer-based support (computer-enhanced support), and (3) a routinely taught control group. Students' argumentation skills and content knowledge were assessed. Content knowledge was assessed prior to and after the intervention, with immediate and delayed posttests. Multiple regression analyses showed that peer argumentation was indeed most frequent in the computer-enhanced condition. Moreover, on the basis of a multilevel path analysis, we found that individual contributions to peer argumentation had a direct effect on posttest argumentation skills and an indirect effect on posttest content knowledge, both immediate and delayed. The indirect effect of argumentation on delayed posttest content knowledge was mediated by immediate posttest knowledge and posttest argumentation skills.","[Larrain, Antonia; Singer, Vivian; Moran, Camila; Sanchez, Alvaro; Silva, Maximiliano; Villavicencio, Constanza] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine; Silva, Maximiliano] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England; [Lopez, Patricia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pinochet, Jorge] Univ Metropolitana Ciencias Educ, Fac Basic Sci, Dept Phys, Nunoa, Chile",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago 8340575, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,,"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Pinochet, Jorge/0000-0002-5703-5699","Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA [ID14I10094, ID14I20094]",This work was supported by Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF) under Grants FONDEF IDeA ID14I10094 and ID14I20094.

However, investigations of perceived stress amongst Spanish-speaking student groups are sparse. This study aimed to (i) describe the translation, adaptation and psychometric properties of a Spanish version of the Dental Environment Stressors questionnaire and (ii) to examine the perceived sources of stress and their associations with the students' study year and gender in two dental schools in Latin America. Materials and methods All students officially registered in the dental schools of the University of San Sebastian (USS) in Chile and the Catholic University of Cordoba (CUC) in Argentina were invited to participate in the study. The DES30 questionnaire was adapted in Spanish using translation/back-translation, an expert bilingual committee, and consensus building. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the instrument's internal consistency, and iterated principal factor analysis with promax rotation was employed to explore its underlying factor structure. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate methods were used to examine the patterns of association between individual stressors, factor scores and students' characteristics. Results Three hundred and four students comprised the study's analytical sample, with two-thirds of those being female. The DES30-Sp demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's a similar to=similar to 0.89). A four-factor solution emerged and included academic workload, clinical training, time constraints and self-efficacy beliefs factors. Fear of failing a course or a year, examinations and grades and lack of time for relaxation were amongst the top individual-item stressors reported by students in both schools. Amongst this group of undergraduate dental students, those in Argentina, in higher study year, and females reported higher perceived stress. Conclusions Increased workload, time constraints and some aspects of clinical training were the top stressors of approximately 300 Chilean and Argentinean dental undergraduates. Some variations between schools, males and females and study years were noted. The Spanish version of the DES30 questionnaire performed well, but future studies should evaluate the instrument's properties in larger and more diverse dental student populations.","[Fonseca, J.; Pizarro, S.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Divaris, K.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Villalba, S.] Catholic Univ Cordoba, Sch Dent, Dept Paediat Dent, Cordoba, Argentina; [Fernandez, M.] Univ San Sebastian, Sch Dent, Adults Clin, Concepcion, Chile; [Codjambassis, A.] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Grad Studies, Off Res & Grad Studies, Santiago, Chile; [Villa-Torres, L.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Polychronopoulou, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Dept Community & Prevent Dent, Athens 11528, Greece",,"Divaris, K (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, UNC Sch Dent, Dept Pediat Dent, 228 Brauer Hall,CB 7450, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",divarisk@dentistry.unc.edu,"Divaris, Kimon/E-4706-2011; Divaris, Kimon/AAU-8735-2021","Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Divaris, Kimon/0000-0003-1290-7251; Fernandez, Marcelo/0000-0002-6980-6219",,,,62,20,27,1,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Secondly, eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis. The results shed light on the need for relevant ICT training from a media literacy perspective, and strategies to address connectivity gaps, lack of adequate environments and work overload.

Parents reported their child's symptomology at 5 years, 10 years, and adolescence (11-17 years; M = 14.4). Structural equation modeling identified a previously unrecognized pathway by which child externalizing problems and negative maternal responsiveness at 5 years mediated associations between ID at 12-18 months and adolescent internalizing, externalizing, and social problems. Positive maternal responsiveness in infancy did not buffer those with ID anemia from developing 5-year internalizing problems.","[Doom, Jenalee R.; Lozoff, Betsy] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Gahagan, Sheila; East, Patricia L.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Encina, Pamela] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Delva, Jorge] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Doom, JR (corresponding author), 300 N Ingalls St 10th Floor, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jrdoom@umich.edu,,"Doom, Jenalee/0000-0003-2857-0817","EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [F32HD088029] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL117860, R01HL088530] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [T32DK071212] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01 HL117860, R01 HL088530] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [F32 HD088029, R03 HD097295, R01 HD033487] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA021181] Funding Source: Medline; NIDDK NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [T32 DK071212] Funding Source: Medline",,,52,3,3,4,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0009-3920,1467-8624,,CHILD DEV,Child Dev.,MAY,2020,91,3,,,,,E545,E562,,10.1111/cdev.13266,,,18,"Psychology, Educational; Psychology, Developmental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,LP3ZU,WOS:000534258400002,31155715,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Estatal,child development,Q1

Middle-class Chilean mothers and children (N = 875; 52% males) were studied when children were 1, 5, 10, and 16 years (1991-2007). Results indicated that highly depressed mothers provided less emotional and material support to their child across all ages, which related to children's lower IQ. Children with lower mental abilities at age 1 received less learning-material support at age 5, which led to mothers' higher depression at child age 10. Mothers' low support was more strongly linked to maternal depression as children got older.

Aim: The present study explored the relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma among caregivers of autistic children in Latin America. Additionally, explore contextual factors that better explain the perception of stigma when accessing services. Methods and Procedure: Approximately 2500 caregivers from six Latin American countries completed an online survey. Descriptive inferential analysis and a pointbiserial correlation were conducted to understand direct relationship between difficulty accessing services and perceived stigma and to test their relationship. Added contextual factors contributing to this relationship were examined through a binary logistic regression. Outcomes and Results: Barriers to accessing services predicted stigma. Contextual factors such as country of residence, frustration experienced by caregivers, gender of autistic child and challenging behaviours had higher odds of experiencing some form of perceived stigma. Conclusions and Implications: These results suggest experiences with stigma to be heavily influenced by environmental factors such cultural differences which in combination with contextual factors could further increase the likelihood of perceiving stigma. When observing stigma within a social-cognitive approach, it is possible that a strong-held adherence to cultural norms, in addition to negative experiences (e.g., frustration) when accessing services, could be influencing caregivers perceived stigma.","[Montenegro, Maria Cecilia; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Abdul-Chani, Monica] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Psychol, 1720 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Valdez, Daniel] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales Sede Argentina F, Tucuman 1966,C1050 AAN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20,Torre AIRD,2do Piso, Santo Domingo 10109, Dominican Rep; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Av 18 Julio 1824, Montevideo 11100, Uruguay; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA, Domingo Repetto 1145,CP B1640EMQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Presbiteriana Mackenzie UPM, Programa Posgrad Disturbios Desenvolvimento, Rua Consolacao 930, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Ave Libertador Bernardo Higgins 1058, Santiago 8330111, Chile",,"Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), 1200 Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu,"Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022; paula, cristiane/D-8968-2017","Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rattazzi, Alexia/0000-0001-7993-2123; Montiel-Nava, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; paula, cristiane/0000-0003-0438-9407; Garrido Candela, Gabriela/0000-0001-8841-8425; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422",,,,69,0,0,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0891-4222,1873-3379,,RES DEV DISABIL,Res.

GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental knowledge for their future works as engineers.

The aim was to identify cultural factors relevant to breast and cervical cancer screening, develop an instrument to assess them and examine its preliminary psychometric properties among Latin American (Latino) and non-Latino White (Anglo) women in Southern California. Seventy-eight Latino and Anglo women participated in semi-structured interviews, which were content coded based on Triandis' methods for the analysis of subjective culture. Based on the emerging cultural elements, items relevant to cancer screening were developed and pilot tested with 161 participants. After the instrument was refined, 314 Latino and Anglo women from various socioeconomic backgrounds completed the CCSS and data were factor analyzed resulting in five cultural factors: cancer screening fatalism, negative beliefs about health professionals, catastrophic disease expectations, symptomatic deterrents and sociocultural deterrents. The instrument demonstrated measurement equivalence, adequate reliability and predictive validity. The research and the CCSS are discussed in terms of implications for the study of culture in relation to health disparities and the development of evidence-based interventions with culturally diverse populations and their health professionals.","[Betancourt, Hector; Flynn, Patricia M.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA; [Betancourt, Hector] Univ La Frontera, Dept Psychol, Temuco, Chile; [Riggs, Matt] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Psychol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Garberoglio, Carlos] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Dept Gen & Oncol Surg, Duarte, CA 91010 USA",,"Betancourt, H (corresponding author), Loma Linda Univ, Dept Psychol, Loma Linda, CA 92354 USA.",hbetancourt@llu.edu,,,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R21CA101867] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,48,36,41,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0268-1153,1465-3648,,HEALTH EDUC RES,Health Educ.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is philosophical, conceptual and theoretical and in proffering a bold thesis, has an argumentative character appropriate to that style. Findings Three stages can be identified over the past 200 years in the relationship between the university and the matter of social responsibility, being successively tacit, weak and now hybrid. In the present stage, new spaces are opening for the university to transcend social responsibility, moving to a worldly and earthly responsibility. However, this new stage is having to contend against the university in an age of cognitive capitalism. As such, a large but hitherto unnoticed culture war is present, the outcome of which is unclear. Research limitations/implications The scholarship informing this paper is wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary (history, social theory, philosophy, critical higher education studies, literature on the idea of the university, comparative higher education, ethics and sociology of knowledge), as it has to be in sustaining the large thesis being contended for, and it has broad hinterlands, which can only lightly be intimated. Practical implications The key implication is that the idea of social responsibility is currently being construed too narrowly and that, therefore, universities - in developing their corporate strategies and missions - should be more ambitious and set their responsibility goals against horizons that go well beyond the social realm. Originality/value The thesis developed here is original in offering a three-stage theory of a 200-year evolution of the socially responsible European university. A new stage of an Earthly responsibility is glimpsed but it is having to contend with a continuing performative university, so leading to a hidden culture war and such that the future of university social responsibility is in doubt.","[Barnett, Ronald] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Tarapaca, Arica, Chile",,"Barnett, R (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Educ, London, England.",ron.barnett@ucl.ac.uk; carolina.guzman.uta@gmail.com,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",Fondecyt projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1200633],This work was supported by Fondecyt project 1200633.,,57,1,1,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

The central hypothesis of this work is that students attending schools with high digital development have higher levels of subjective well-being. To test this hypothesis, two quantitative empirical studies carried out in Chile are used as sources of information. The first one is the 2013 National Survey of School Well-being, applied to 15-year-old students (4964 cases) from 191 schools, and the second one is the 2012 National Census of Educational Computing. Subsequently, after both sources are merged, a descriptive analysis and an explanatory model are created based on the dependent variable Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), and the independent variables School Digital Development Index (SDDI) and attributes of establishment and subjects. Among the results, the finding of a positive and significant relationship between school digital development and higher subjective well-being scores of students stands out.","[Donoso, Gonzalo; Casas, Ferran; Lopez, Mauricio] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Donoso, Gonzalo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Innovat Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Casas, Ferran] Univ Andres Bello, Programa Doctorado Educ & Sociedad, Santiago, Chile; [Carlos Oyanedel, Juan] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Mauricio] Univ Santiago Chile, Ctr Expt Social Sci, Santiago, Chile",,"Donoso, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Innovat Ctr Anacleto Angelini, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.",gmdonoso@uc.cl; ferran.casas@udg.edu; juan.oyanedel@unab.cl; mauricio.lopez@usach.cl,,"Lopez-Tapia, Mauricio/0000-0003-4459-2768; Oyanedel, Juan/0000-0003-4023-6926",PIA CONICYT project [CIE 160009]; FONDECYT Regular projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181533],"This work was made possible thanks to the funding granted by the CIE 160009 PIA CONICYT and FONDECYT Regular 1181533 projects.

Sixth-grade students selected from four schools located in Santiago, Chile read a two-paragraph text on a computer screen and were asked either to read it (read-only group), highlight text as they read (highlighting group), type notes from the text into a textbox as they read (notetaking group), fill in an interactive graphic organizer (graphic organizer group), highlight first and then take notes from the text (highlighting + notetaking group) or highlight first and then fill in an interactive graphic organizer (highlighting + graphic organizer group). The graphic organizer group, highlighting + graphic organizer group, and highlighting + notetaking group each made significantly more integrative eye movements between the two paragraphs during learning (indicating better learning processes) and produced higher comprehension test scores (indicating better learning outcomes) as compared to the read-only group, whereas the highlighting group and notetaking group did not. Results are consistent with the idea that filling in graphic organizers is a generative learning strategy, whereas highlighting and typing notes into a textbox are not generative learning strategies. Similarly using two learning strategies together (notetaking and highlighting) leads to generative learning even though using either one of those strategies alone does not, so in this case two learning strategies are better than one.","[Ponce, Hector R.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Mayer, Richard E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Soledad Loyola, Maria; Mendez, Ester E.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Lab Tecnol Interact, VirtuaLab, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Mario J.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Dept Ingn Ind, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile",,"Ponce, HR (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Adm & Econ, Ave LB OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile.",hector.ponce@usach.cl; rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu; maria.loyola.f@usach.cl; mario.lopez@usach.cl; ester.mendez@usach.cl,"Ponce, Hector R./H-9545-2019","Lopez, Mario/0000-0003-0909-7702; Ponce, Hector R./0000-0002-7984-3945",CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT [1151092]; Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile,This study was partially funded by CONICYT of Chile through grant FONDECYT #1151092 and Proyectos Basales at the University of Santiago of Chile.,,41,10,10,7,50,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

We examined whether the current allocation of time to physical activity among young people leads to outcomes that may affect their well being as youth and their longer-term life prospects. Design: The study group comprised a random sample of 1692 high-school students (14.8 +/- 0.7 years old) from urban Santiago, Chile attending private and non-private schools. Setting: We measured physical activity habits accounting for time spent in class, studying and screen-based entertainment, hours of daily recreational activity and hours of weekly scheduled exercise. Obesity and abdominal obesity were diagnosed according to CDC/NCHS 2000, NHANES III and IDF criteria, respectively. Method: Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between current physical activity habits, confounders and the likelihood of suffering from obesity and abdominal obesity. Results: Young people reporting the lowest allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play showed a higher risk of obesity and abdominal obesity. Those reporting moderate allocation of time to physical activity, scheduled exercise and active play were more likely to suffer from central obesity as defined by IDF criteria. Study participants attending partially subsidized schools showed the highest risk of obesity and central obesity. Conclusions: In this sample, young people appear not to be employing optimal strategies for making weight-related choices, since reduced physical activity, obesity and central obesity are proximate causes of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.","[Correa-Burrows, Paulina] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ Publ Finance 2, Madrid, Spain; [Burrows, Raquel A.] Univ Chile, Inst Nutr & Food Technol, Santiago, Chile",,"Correa-Burrows, P (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ URJC, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Campus Vicalvaro,P Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",paulina.correa.burrows@urjc.es,"Burrows, Raquel/A-8489-2015; Burrows, Raquel/AAF-5660-2019; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/O-7436-2014","Burrows, Raquel/0000-0001-9155-0689; Correa-Burrows, Paulina/0000-0002-6177-1162",,,,26,2,2,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0017-8969,1748-8176,,HEALTH EDUC J,Health Educ.

Education systems have a role to play in this, especially given the growing evidence of a digital divide. Through this study, we look to identify and characterize factors related to the digital skills of 10th grade Chilean students, as measured by a national standardized test. A mixed methodology was used to explore these factors and provide a more detailed analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a Hierarchical Linear Model to determine which factors explain student performance on the test. In addition to this, a qualitative analysis was also carried out using an exploratory case study. The purpose of this case study was to take a more in-depth look at the characteristics of high and low-performing students on the digital skills test. This was done by analyzing their activities, perceptions and motivations when using technology. The quantitative results revealed that the most important factors in developing digital skills are having access to a computer at home, linguistic capital, socioeconomic status, and years of experience using a computer. The qualitative study also revealed that students who scored highly on the test were generally able to focus and concentrate on their school assignments when using the Internet. These students also adopted cognitive and organizational strategies in order to be more effective. Our findings should be further investigated in order to support the design of school activities that aim to develop students' digital skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This research presents the educational, quantitative, and qualitative evaluation of an Augmented Reality and Mobile Pedestrian Navigation app. The software was designed for mobile learning in an educational context, to evaluate its effectiveness when applied as a teaching tool, in comparison to similar tools such as those present in e-learning. A mixed-method analysis was used, with primary school students from Chile as subjects (n = 143). They were split into one control group and one experimental group. The control group worked in an e-learning environment, while the experimental group performed the activity as field work, making use of the app (m-learning). Students were evaluated pretest and posttest using an objective test to measure their level of learning. In parallel, a satisfaction survey was carried out concerning the use of these technologies, in addition to interviews with several students and teachers of the experimental group. Pretest-posttest results indicate that the experimental group outperformed the control group in their learning levels. The results of the interviews and the satisfaction survey show that these technologies, combined with fieldwork, increase the effectiveness of the teaching-learning processes. Further, they promote the interaction of students with contents for learning, and they improve students' performance in the educational process. The main goal is to provide a methodology for the analysis of an ad-hoc designed app. The app is intended to provide an m-learning process for subjects being taught about cultural heritage. The quantitative and qualitative results obtained show that it can be more effective than using similar technologies in e-learning contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows the relationship between particular elements of the teachers' pedagogy and the characteristics of the software design. In this model, the 'classroom atmosphere' is embedded in the human-computer interface scenarios and elements, the 'teaching strategy' in the design of the browsing strategies of the software, and the 'learning strategy' in the particular forms of interaction with the software. The model demonstrates significant links between the study of Pedagogy and the study of Information Technology in Education and has implications for the relationship between those two areas of research and consequently for teacher training, The model proposes a perspective on educational software design that takes into consideration not only learning theories, but also teaching theories and practice.

The proposals and experiences of the Society for the Construction of Educational Facilities (1937-1987) in Chile and the Board of Constructions for Technical and Secondary Education (1934-1969) in Portugal are analysed. Established in the 1930s, these centralised bodies managed, organised, and controlled state school building projects in such a way as to achieve uniformity in design, creating architectural identities that embodied both the educational values and the representative character of the State. These bodies were influenced by similar global circumstances, and their activities were guided by the recommendations issued by intergovernmental organisations of the time. Such a situation brought their projects closer together in terms of their functional, aesthetic, technical-constructive characteristics. After examining and identifying the international influences which brought them closer in terms of the educational meanings and values associated with school architecture, the paper identifies the local circumstances that guided the design and construction processes of schools in both countries, bringing fresh geographical insights to school architecture discussion. At the same time, possible global readings of strategies, influences and results are explored, enabling us to understand school architecture as part of a nation's cultural values and as a material expression of the social model of modernity, which will continue to meet the challenges that schools face in twenty-first-century society.","[Gilles, Claudia Torres] Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile; [Alegre, Alexandra] Univ Lisbon, CITUA, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Gilles, CT (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Architecture, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Portugal 84, Santiago Of Chile, Chile.",claudiatorres@uchilefau.cl,"Alegre, Alexandra/AAC-4817-2020; Torres Gilles, Claudia/J-4083-2015","Alegre, Alexandra/0000-0002-7280-5073; Torres Gilles, Claudia/0000-0002-5577-1385",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014],This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [11160322]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ATP-AQI/3273/2014].,,46,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-9230,1477-674X,,PAEDAGOG HIST,Paedagog.

The purpose of this study is to present recent research on organizational change processes in universities. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach applied corresponds to the social issue maturation framework, to identify, describe and assess patterns of change across higher education institutions. The maturation of sustainability in universities can be divided into four stages: emergence, popularization, formalization and maturity. Findings The findings indicate that sustainability processes often begin as ad hoc processes which grow and mature over time as a range of different actors join in. However, sustainability in universities is increasingly connected with sustainability in the private sector and with other public actors. Moreover, there is a growing acknowledgement of the interactions between society, industry and academia. Originality/value The value of the paper is to provide a critical assessment of the potential of living lab projects initiated in Belgium (Brussels) and Chile (Santiago de Chile) to anchor sustainability firmly both in the functioning of the university and in the interactions with the neighborhood. The authors reflect on the requirements and the implementation of these initiatives as a strong indication of mature sustainability integration in, and by way of, universities.","[Vargas, Luis] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Mac-Lean, Claudia] Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile; [Huge, Jean] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Syst Ecol & Resource Management Unit, Brussels, Belgium",,"Mac-Lean, C (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, OfAcad Affairs, Punta Arenas, Chile.",clau.maclean.b@gmail.com,"vargas, luis/A-2109-2011","vargas, Luis/0000-0001-6539-1768; Huge, Jean/0000-0002-3695-547X","Complex Engineering Systems Institute, ISCI [CONICYT: FB0816]; VLIR-UOS; ARES","L.

A Case Study on Scientific Representations from Chile,minerva,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Social dimensions; Scientific representations; Chile; Scientific black boxes; Literature meta-analysis,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; BOUNDARY OBJECTS; SCIENCE; ADAPTATION; POLITICS; ANTHROPOCENE; KNOWLEDGE; SOCIOLOGY,"Over the last few decades climate change has been gaining importance in international scientific and political debates. However, the social sciences, especially in Latin America, have only lately become interested in the subject and their approach is still vague. Scientific understanding of global environmental change and the process of designing public policies to face them are characterized by their complexity as well as by epistemic and normative uncertainties. This makes it necessary to problematize the way in which research efforts understand 'the social' of climate change. How do 'the climate' and 'the social' interpenetrate as scientific objects? What does the resulting field look like? Is the combination capable of promoting reflexivity and collaboration on the issue, or does it merely become dispersed with diffuse boundaries? Our paper seeks to answer these and other related questions using Chile as a case study and examining peer-reviewed scientific research on the topic. By combining in-depth qualitative content analysis of each paper with a statistical meta-analysis, we were able to: characterize the key content and forms of such literature; identify divisions and patterns within it; and, discuss some factors and trends that may help explain these. We conclude that the literature displays two competing trends: while it is inclined to become fragmented beyond the scope of the 'mitigation' black box, it also tends to cluster along the lines of methodological distinctions traditionally contested within the social sciences. This, in turn, highlights the persistence of disciplinary divisions within an allegedly interdisciplinary field.","[Billi, Marco; Blanco, Gustavo; Urquiza, Anahi] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Billi, Marco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas Latitu, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Blanco, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Urquiza, Anahi] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Av Capitan Ignacio Carrera Pinto 1045, Nunoa, Santiago De Chi, Chile",,"Billi, M (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Av Blanco Encalada 2002,Piso 4, Santiago, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.; Billi, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Ctr Estudios Modelos Crisis, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Penalolen, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",mbilli@alumnos.uai.cl,"Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/N-8046-2019; Billi, Marco/ABG-2953-2020; Urquiza, Anah’/P-8822-2019","Blanco-Wells, Gustavo/0000-0002-4980-3424; Urquiza, Anah’/0000-0001-6901-0846; Billi, Marco/0000-0003-3161-6468","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project [15110009, 15150003]; National PhD Scholarship (Chile) [CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160857, 11180824]; Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile) [NS130017]","This work has received funding provided by the following institutional grants: Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15110009 (all authors); National PhD Scholarship (Chile) No. CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2017-21170615 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDAP Project No. 15150003 (Gustavo Blanco); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 1160857 (Gustavo Blanco); Millennium Scientific Initiative (Chile), Project No. NS130017 (Marco Billi); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Chile), FONDECYT Grant No. 11180824 (Anahi Urquiza).",,73,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0026-4695,1573-1871,,MINERVA,Minerva,SEP,2019,57,3,,,,,293,315,,10.1007/s11024-019-09369-2,,,23,"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,IW5KO,WOS:000485017600002,,hybrid,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,minerva,Q3

However, little is known about what students have learned about NOSI during their pre-college school years. The purpose of this large-scale follow-up international project (i.e. 32 countries and regions, spanning six continents and including 3917 students for the high school sample) was to collect data on what exiting high school students have learned about NOSI. Additionally, the study investigated changes in 12th grade students' NOSI understandings compared to seventh grade (i.e. 20 countries and regions) students' understandings from a prior investigation [Lederman et al.

This study documents and discusses graduating high school students' understandings and compares their understandings to seventh grade students' understandings of the same aspects of scientific inquiry for each country. It is important to note that collecting data from each of the 130+ countries globally was not feasible. Similarly, it was not possible to collect data from every region of each country.

This depletion effect can be incorporated into cognitive load theory that is concerned with using the properties of human cognitive architecture, especially working memory, when designing instruction. Two experiments were carried out on the spacing effect that occurs when learning that is spaced by temporal gaps between learning episodes is superior to identical, massed learning with no gaps between learning episodes. Using primary school students learning mathematics, it was found that students obtained lower scores on a working memory capacity test (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher ratings of cognitive load (Experiment 2) after massed than after spaced practice. The reduction in working memory capacity may be attributed to working memory resource depletion following the relatively prolonged mental effort associated with massed compared to spaced practice. An expansion of cognitive load theory to incorporate working memory resource depletion along with instructional design implications, including the spacing effect, is discussed.","[Chen, Ouhao; Sweller, John] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Chen, Ouhao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore; [Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Early Start Res Inst, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,"Chen, OH; Sweller, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Chen, OH (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.",chenouhao_lucky@126.com; jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; paas@fsw.eur.nl; j.sweller@unsw.edu.au,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019","Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Chen, Ouhao/0000-0001-9645-1946",CONICYT PAI [82140021]; PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003],"The second author acknowledges partial funding from CONICYT PAI, national funding research program for returning researchers from abroad, 2014, No 82140021; and PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence, Project FB0003.",,30,51,52,8,38,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

Several agents' characteristics may moderate their instructional effectiveness, including appearance, gender, nonverbal communication, motion, and voice. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test hypotheses from diverse theories predicting the effects of these agents' characteristics. We tested predictions of cognitive load theory, cognitive theory of multimedia learning, computers are social actors, social agency theory, uncanny valley, and the action observation network. Our meta-analysis of 32 effect sizes (N = 2104) revealed a small overall effect (g+ = 0.20), showing that learning with multimedia pedagogical agents was more effective than learning without these agents. As predicted by the redundancy effect of cognitive load theory and the coherence principle of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, 2D agents (g+ = 0.38) tended to be more effective than 3D agents (g+ = 0.11). As predicted by the computers are social actors hypothesis, most of the agents' characteristics, including nonverbal communication, motion, and voice, appeared not to moderate their effectiveness. We conclude that multimedia pedagogical agents help learning through multimedia, and that students may be able to learn similarly from different types of agents.","[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Wong, Rachel M.; Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,"Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; rachel.wong@wsu.edu; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu; paas@essb.eur.nl,,"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255],This study is funded from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255.,,107,3,3,23,36,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

In this review article we focus on five of these strategies or solutions to problematic instructional designs in multimedia learning: (a) the multimedia principle (use visualizations and drawings to complement texts); (b) the split-attention effect or spatial contiguity principle (show texts contiguously or integrated with visualizations); (c) the redundancy effect, alike the coherence principle (remove nonessential learning information); (d) the signaling principle (cue or signal essential learning information); and (e) the transient information effect or segmenting principle (segment or control the pace of animations and videos). Usually, both cognitive theories have investigated solutions that instructors, teachers, and designers should pursue to optimize students' learning. Here, in a novel approach, we show that these strategies can also be used by learners who want to self-manage their cognitive load and learning process. We provide several examples of both instructor- and learner-managed solutions aligned with these strategies. When assessing which agent, either the instructor or the learner, was most effective, we observed mixed results in the literature. However, the expertise reversal effect may help predict the direction of these effects: novice students may learn better under instructor-managed conditions, whereas more expert students may learn more under learner-managed conditions.","[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile; [de Koning, Bjorn B.; Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fiorella, Logan] Univ Georgia, Dept Educ Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,"Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Inst Educ, Santiago, Chile.",jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; b.b.dekoning@essb.eur.nl; lfiorella@uga.edu; paas@essb.eur.nl,,"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717",ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; ANID Fondecyt [11180255],Funding from ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 and ANID Fondecyt 11180255 is gratefully acknowledged.,,168,6,6,27,38,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

Methodologically, these studies have addressed human vocalisation at an individual level. In the present study, we asked whether patterns such as musical intervals can also be found among the voices of people engaging in a conversation as an emerging interpersonal phenomenon. Fifty-six participants were randomly paired and assigned to either a control or a low-trust condition. Frequency ratios were generated by juxtaposing nonlocal fundamental frequency (f0) productions from two people engaged in each given dyadic conversation. Differences were found among conditions, both in terms of interval distribution and precision. These results support the idea that psychological dispositions modulate the musical intervals generated between participants through mutual real-time vocal accommodation. They also underscore the inter-domain use of musical intervals.","[Robledo, Juan P.; Hurtado, Esteban; Prado, Felipe; Cornejo, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Language Interact & Phenomenol Lab LIF, Santiago, Chile; [Hurtado, Esteban] Univ Diego Portales, UDP INECO Fdn Core Neurosci UIFCoN, Lab Cognit & Social Neurosci, Santiago, Chile; [Roman, Domingo] Univ Santiago Chile, Humanities Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Robledo, Juan P.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Mus, Ctr Mus & Sci, Cambridge, England",,"Robledo, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge Wolfson Coll, Barton Rd, Cambridge CB3 9BB, England.",jper2@cam.ac.uk,"Cornejo, Carlos/Q-6871-2017","Cornejo, Carlos/0000-0001-5426-0025; Prado, Felipe/0000-0003-3257-9646",Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [1100863],Ethical approval for this project was given by the Ethical Committee of the Psychology Department of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile as well as by the Bioethics Advisory Committee of the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT) [Grant 1100863].,,52,1,1,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0305-7356,1741-3087,,PSYCHOL MUSIC,Psychol.

In turn, the perceived importance of environmental sustainability within higher education is growing at a rapid rate. This paper provides a summary of key elements as they apply to dentistry, and provides an introduction to the reader of an early consensus of how sustainability could be included as part of the dental curriculum. Methods The consensus opinion within this paper largely centres around discussion at the ADEE sustainability workshop at the annual conference in Berlin (August 2019). In order to help inform discussions at the workshop, a brief scoping questionnaire was circulated to potential participants regarding their understanding and current teaching practices in sustainability. An infographic was designed to help delegates remember the important elements of sustainable dentistry. Delegates discussed the concept of sustainability alongside the infographic, and how they could link these with the Graduating European Dentist (GED) curriculum. Results The discussions within the workshop largely centred around 4 main themes: Disease prevention and health promotion, Patient education and empowerment, Lean service delivery and Preferential use of strategies with lower environmental impact. Discussion It is apparent that there is a widespread need for teaching materials relating to environmental sustainability; this includes specific learning outcomes relating to the 4 educational domains of the Graduating European Dentist curriculum, and methods for teaching and assessing these outcomes. Conclusion This paper reports consensus on the first phase of a pan-European working group on Sustainability in dental education.","[Duane, Brett; Darragh, Jauregui-Hogan; Ramasubbu, Darshini; Van Harten, Maria] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin Dent Sch & Hosp, Div 3,Leonards Pl, Dublin, Ireland; [Dixon, Jonathan; Martin, Nicolas] Univ Sheffield, Sch Clin Dent, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ambibola, Giwa] Queen Mary Univ London, Royal London Dent Hosp, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, Inst Dent, London, England; [Aldana, Clara; Henao, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia; [Couglan, James; Daniela, Timus] Dublin Dent Sch & Hosp, European Dent Students Assoc, Assoc Dent Educ Europe, Dublin, Ireland; [Veiga, Nelio] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Perez, Francesc] Univ Odontol, Adema Escuela, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Schwendicke, Falk] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Correia, Maria] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Inst Ciencias Saude, Lisbon, Portugal; [Quinteros, Maria] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Quinteros, Maria] Univ Chile, Escuela Salud Publ, Santiago, Chile; [Paganelli, Corrado] UO Odontostomatol, DSMC, Brescia, Italy; [Vos, Peter] Univ Coll Leuven Limburg, Leuven, Belgium; [Moreno Lopez, Rosa] Univ Aberdeen, Dent Sch, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Field, James] Cardiff Univ, Sch Dent, Univ Dent Hosp, Cardiff, Wales",,"Duane, B (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin Dent Sch & Hosp, Div 3,Leonards Pl, Dublin, Ireland.",Brett.Duane@dental.tcd.ie,"Duane, Brett/AAA-8177-2022; Correia, Maria/ABE-2500-2021; van HARTEN, Maria T/AAB-5447-2021; Correia, Maria/H-9952-2012; Veiga, Nelio/F-5279-2017; Paganelli, Corrado/E-9108-2010","Duane, Brett/0000-0001-9670-0594; van HARTEN, Maria T/0000-0002-6759-4144; Correia, Maria/0000-0002-6141-9089; Field, James/0000-0002-5462-4156; Moreno Lopez, Rosa/0000-0001-8761-2496; Timus, Daniela/0000-0002-4904-1108; Veiga, Nelio/0000-0001-6288-0435; Paganelli, Corrado/0000-0003-1085-3587; Schwendicke, Falk/0000-0003-1223-1669; Dixon, Jonathan/0000-0002-3499-175X",,,,47,4,4,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Methods: Participants completed a cross-sectional self-report survey to evaluate QOL using the WHOQOL-BREF scale and eating habits with a food habits survey. Results: Students reporting a better healthy eating habits score also presented a higher QOL. Eating breakfast and eating home-cooked meals is a protective factor for QOL in each domain. The consumption of sweet snacks was shown to be a risk factor for the physical health and environment domains. The consumption of fast food is shown as the greatest risk factor in the physical domain. Conclusion: Healthy and unhealthy eating habits are associated with different dimensions of QOL.

When factors such as appeal, media, realism, size, and interaction are not tightly controlled between statics and animations, researchers may often be comparing apples with oranges. In this review, we provide a categorization of these confounding variables and offer some possible solutions to generate more tightly controlled studies. Future research could consider these biases and solutions, in order to design more equivalent visualizations.

Consequently, when learning from dynamic pictures, students must process in working memory the current images while trying to remember the images that left the screen. This additional activity in working memory may lead dynamic pictures to be less suitable instructional materials than comparable static pictures, which are more permanent. In order to directly show the influence of transient visual information on dynamic learning environments, we designed a well-matched comparison between a permanent and a transient presentation of an abstract-symbol memory task on the computer. In the task, 104 university students (50% females) had to memorize the type, color, and position of the symbols in a rectangular configuration. In addition, an embodied cognition factor was included where the symbols in the task were either shown with a precision grasping static hand or not. We also assessed how individual characteristics (spatial ability, spatial memory span, and gender) influenced performance.

In order to produce a working document for the dental educator, this paper focuses on those methods where IT can assist in the education and competence development of dental students and dentists (e.g. e-learning, distance learning, simulations and computer-based assessment). Web pages and other information-gathering devices have become an essential part of our daily life, as they provide extensive information on all aspects of our society. This is mirrored in dental education where there are many different tools available, as listed in this report. IT offers added value to traditional teaching methods and examples are provided. In spite of the continuing debate on the learning effectiveness of e-learning applications, students request such approaches as an adjunct to the traditional delivery of learning materials. Faculty require support to enable them to effectively use the technology to the benefit of their students. This support should be provided by the institution and it is suggested that, where possible, institutions should appoint an e-learning champion with good interpersonal skills to support and encourage faculty change. From a global prospective, all students and faculty should have access to e-learning tools. This report encourages open access to e-learning material, platforms and programs. The quality of such learning materials must have well defined learning objectives and involve peer review to ensure content validity, accuracy, currency, the use of evidence-based data and the use of best practices. To ensure that the developers' intellectual rights are protected, the original content needs to be secure from unauthorized changes. Strategies and recommendations on how to improve the quality of e-learning are outlined. In the area of assessment, traditional examination schemes can be enriched by IT, whilst the Internet can provide many innovative approaches. Future trends in IT will evolve around improved uptake and access facilitated by the technology (hardware and software). The use of Web 2.0 shows considerable promise and this may have implications on a global level. For example, the one-laptop-per-child project is the best example of what Web 2.0 can do: minimal use of hardware to maximize use of the Internet structure. In essence, simple technology can overcome many of the barriers to learning. IT will always remain exciting, as it is always changing and the users, whether dental students, educators or patients are like chameleons adapting to the ever-changing landscape.","[Mattheos, N.; Attstrom, R.] Malmo Univ Hosp, Ctr Oral Hlth Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Mattheos, N.] Univ Bern, Sch Dent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Stefanovic, N.] Univ Belgrade, Fac Stomatol, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Apse, P.; Care, R.] Riga Stradina Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Buchanan, J.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Brown, P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Camilleri, A.] Univ Malta, Fac Dent Surg, Msida, Malta; [Fabrikant, E.] Moscow State Univ Med & Dent, Moscow, Russia; [Gundersen, S.] Univ Oslo, Fac Dent, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Honkala, S.] Finnish Dent Soc Apollonia, Helsinki, Finland; [Johnson, L.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jonas, I.] Univ Dent Sch, Freiburg, Germany; [Kavadella, A.] Univ Athens, Sch Dent, Athens, Greece; [Moreira, J.] Inst Super Ciencias Dentarias, Oporto, Portugal; [Peroz, I.; Seemann, R.] Charite, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Perryer, D.

Three of the four main subscales (all but interpersonal) had acceptable reliability indices. In addition, although the impact of the Positive Impression subscale on responses to the main scales was generally low, the effect is not ignorable, and its impact should be modeled in further investigations of the EQ-i: YV-S. Finally, four main subscales of EQ-i: YV-S showed significant power in the prediction of general self-concept and moderate temporal stability.

This concern has increased the study of the phenomena, which has resulted in many scientific publications. Mobbing has been characterised as an emerging risk at work. The aim of this longitudinal study was to analyse the influence of mobbing on depressive symptoms in a sample of employees working with people with intellectual disabilities (ID). MethodThe sample consisted of 372 Spanish employees working with people with ID at 61 job centres in the Valencian Community (Spain). Seventy-nine (21.2%) participants were men, and 293 were (78.8%) women. Mobbing was evaluated by the Mobbing-UNIPSICO scale, and depressive symptoms were measured using the Zung Self Rating Depression Scale. Using analyses of variance (anova), we tested the differences in depressive symptoms according to the mobbing criteria indicated by Leymann, that is, frequency and duration at Time 1 and Time 2. ResultsEmployees who met the mobbing criteria: frequency (at least once a week) and duration (at least 6 months) at the two study times presented significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than employees who met mobbing criteria at Time 1, but did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 2, and employees who did not meet any criteria for mobbing at Time 1 or Time 2. ConclusionsWe conclude that permanence of mobbing from Time 1 to Time 2 increases depressive symptoms.","[Figueiredo-Ferraz, H.; Gil-Monte, P.

In this work, we investigated whether gender imbalance in the participant samples of these studies may have contributed to the mixed results. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized experiments in which groups of students learning through dynamic visualizations were compared to groups receiving static visualizations. Our sample focused on tasks that could be categorized as either biologically secondary tasks (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics: STEM) or biologically primary tasks (manipulative-procedural). The meta-analysis of 46 studies (82 effect sizes and 5474 participants) revealed an overall small-sized effect (g+=0.23) showing that dynamic visualizations were more effective than static visualizations. Regarding potential moderators, we observed that gender was influential: the dynamic visualizations were more effective on samples with less females and more males (g+=0.36). We also observed that educational level, learning domain, media compared, and reporting reliability measures moderated the results. We concluded that because many visualization studies have used samples with a gender imbalance, this may be a significant factor in explaining why instructional dynamic and static visualizations seem to vary in their effectiveness. Our findings also support considering the gender variable in research about cognitive load theory and instructional visualizations.","[Castro-Alonso, Juan C.] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Wong, Mona] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Adesope, Olusola O.] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ayres, Paul] Univ New South Wales, Sch Educ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Paas, Fred] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paas, Fred] Univ Wollongong, Sch Educ, Early Start, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,"Castro-Alonso, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile.",jccastro@ciae.uchile.cl; wpsmona@hku.hk; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu; p.ayres@unsw.edu.au; paas@essb.eur.nl,"Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/I-5321-2019; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Wong, Mona/R-9026-2019","Castro-Alonso, Juan Cristobal/0000-0003-3186-3717; Wong, Mona/0000-0002-5595-6371",PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project [FB0003],Funding from PIA-CONICYT Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence Project FB0003 is gratefully acknowledged.,,108,28,28,1,16,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

However, very little is hitherto known about the effects of these processes on specific situated communities. Through a multi-method approach (bibliometrics and interviews), we provide a nuanced description of these effects on the becoming of university-based sociology in Valparaiso, Chile, during the last fifteen or so years. The paper pays special attention to the emergence of a particular form of internationalization based on international indexes and rankings that has gained influence on the day-to-day practices of the scholarly communities in that part of the scholarly (semi-)periphery. We thoroughly described the entanglements of individual trajectories and institutional framings in the practices and discourses of sociologists in Valparaiso. The article concludes by highlighting the tensions arising from the encounter of traditions and some trade-offs of the current form of internationalization for (semi-)peripheral communities.","[Koch, Tomas; Ayala, Ricardo A.] Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, Korte Meer 3-5, B-9000 Ghent, Flanders, Belgium; [Koch, Tomas] Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Sociol, Avda Playa Ancha 850, Valparaiso, Chile; [Blanco-Wells, Gustavo] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Ciencias Sociales, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Ayala, Ricardo A.] Res Fdn Flanders, Brussels, Belgium",,"Koch, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, Korte Meer 3-5, B-9000 Ghent, Flanders, Belgium.; Koch, T (corresponding author), Univ Playa Ancha, Dept Sociol, Avda Playa Ancha 850, Valparaiso, Chile.",Tomas.Koch@UGent.be,"; Ayala, Ricardo A./E-1335-2018","Koch, Tomas/0000-0002-7408-4556; Ayala, Ricardo A./0000-0001-7840-1072",DGI-UPLA [CSO01-1121]; ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2015 [72160036],This work received funding from DGI-UPLA (CSO01-1121) and ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2015 - 72160036.,,47,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0026-4695,1573-1871,,MINERVA,Minerva,MAR,2021,59,1,,,,,99,122,,10.1007/s11024-020-09421-6,,OCT 2020,24,"Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy Of Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics,QI8IP,WOS:000579791600001,,,,,2022-04-06,Estatal,minerva,Q3

There is no reliable and valid instrument for assessing QoL in people with ID in Colombia. We investigated the internal structure of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale and tested whether the scale identified the eight interrelated domains of the QoL conceptual framework originally described by. MethodData were collected from 602 adults with moderate levels of ID and respective proxies, who completed the self-report and the report by other scales, respectively. Five measurement models were tested through confirmatory factor analysis. ResultsThe eight correlated dimension model showed the best fit to the data. Reliability and convergent validity of the indicators were satisfactory in both versions of the scale (self-report and proxy report). ConclusionsThis study contributes to research on QoL measurement by providing the first empirical evidence regarding the dimensionality, internal structure and psychometric properties of the Colombian version of the INICO-FEAPS scale. Moreover, the study presents the first adaptation of a specific QoL scale for people with ID in Colombia, which may in the future be useful for implementing evidence-based practices and developing person-centred support plans.","[Verdugo-Alonso, M.

That way, different services may be needed at various stages of their lifetimes. This study aimed to describe service encounters and hours of service per week for individuals with ASD in Latin American countries and compare the data from three age groups (preschoolers, school-aged, and adolescents). Methods: The data were obtained from an online survey adapted by Red Espectro Autista Latinoamerica (REAL) in 6 different South & Central American countries. The total sample was composed of 2520 caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD. Results: Service encounters for Speech, Occupational, and Behavioral Therapies decreased with patient age, while medication increased. Regardless of the age group, a large proportion of individuals (19-37 %) were not receiving treatment, and those receiving treatment got fewer hours than best practice recommendations. For adolescents, the gaps in treatment are even greater and less consistent. Discussion: Failure to offer timely identification and intervention for ASD will result in more impairment of the individual and the family burden. Although there are several initiatives to develop more resources for this population in Latin-America, the provision of services for ASD is still undervalued. Many such individuals might not be receiving the services they need, while","[Montiel-Nava, Cecilia] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Cukier, Sebastian; Rattazzi, Alexia] PANAACEA Programa Argentino Ninos Adolescentes &, B1640EMQ, RA-1145 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Garrido, Gabriela] Univ Republica, Dept Montevideo, Bulevar Gen Artigas 1550, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Valdez, Daniel] FLACSO, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Valdez, Daniel] Univ Buenos Aires, C1050AAN CABA, RA-1966 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Paula, Cristiane Silvestre] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Dev Disorder Program, Rua Consolacao,930Consolacao, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Garcia, Ricardo] Univ Chile, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 1058, Santiago, Chile; [Rosoli, Analia] Org Estados Iberoamer Educ Ciencia & Cultura OEI, Av Sarasota 20, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Irarrazaval, Matias] Millenium Inst Res Depress & Personal, Avda Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Montiel-Nava, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Psychol Sci, 1201 W Univ Dr, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",cecilia.montielnava@utrgv.edu; sebastiancukier@panaacea.org; gabrielagarridof86@gmail.com; daniel.valdez@me.com; csilvestrep09@gmail.com; ricardo.garcia.sepulveda@gmail.com; analiarosolimurillo@gmail.com; matias.irarrazaval@minsal.cl; alexiarattazzi@panaacea.org,"paula, cristiane S/D-8968-2017; Montiel, Cecilia/AAP-1153-2020; Montiel, Cecilia/AAD-7925-2022","paula, cristiane S/0000-0003-0438-9407; Montiel, Cecilia/0000-0002-4293-5416; Cukier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1497-4709; Rosoli Murillo, Analia/0000-0002-1803-233X; Irarrazaval, Matias/0000-0002-9087-8305; Valdez, Daniel/0000-0001-5602-8422",,,,86,5,5,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-9467,1878-0237,,RES AUTISM SPECT DIS,Res.

The current article evaluates the measurement invariance of the BMSLSS across cultural contexts. This cross-sectional study sampled 7,739 adolescents and emerging adults in 23 countries. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit of configural and partial measurement weights invariance models, indicating similar patterns and strengths in factor loading for both adolescents and emerging adults across various countries. We found insufficient evidence for scalar invariance in both the adolescents' and the emerging adults' samples. A multi-level confirmatory factor analysis indicated configural invariance of the structure at country and individual level. Internal consistency, evaluated by alpha and omega coefficients per country, yielded acceptable results. The translated BMSLSS across different cultural contexts presents good psychometric characteristics similar to what has been reported in the original scale, though scalar invariance remains problematic. Our results indicate that the BMSLSS forms a brief measure of life satisfaction, which has accrued substantial evidence of construct validity, thus suitable for use in cross-cultural surveys with adolescents and emerging adults, although evaluation of degree of invariance must be carried out to ensure its suitability for mean comparisons.","[Abubakar, Amina; van de Vijver, Fons; He, Jia; Adams, Byron; Celenk, Ozgur; Perdomo, Cristina; Suryani, Angela] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Abubakar, Amina] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Barcelona, Spain; [Aldhafri, Said] Sultan Qaboot Univ, Muscat, Oman; [Aldhafri, Said] Bahcesehir Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arasa, Josephine] US Int Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Boer, Diana] Univ Koblenz Landau, Koblenz, Germany; [Dimitrova, Radosveta] Stockholm Univ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ferreira, Maria Cristina] Salgado Oliveira Univ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fischer, Ronald] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Fischer, Ronald] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Mbebeb, Fomba Emmanuel] Univ Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon; [Frias, Maria Teresa] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Fresno, Andres; Spencer, Rosario] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Gillath, Omri] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Harb, Charles] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; [Handani, Penny; Pandia, Weny Savitry; Suryani, Angela] Atma Jaya Catholic Univ, Jarkata, Indonesia; [Hapunda, Given] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Kamble, Shanmukh] Karnatak Univ, Dharwad, Karnataka, India; [Kosic, Marianna] Slovene Res Inst, Sci Cultural Inst Mandala, Trieste, Italy; [Looh, Joseph Lah] Univ Buea, Buea, Cameroon; [Mazrui, Lubna; Murugami, Margaret] Kenyatta Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mendia, Rafael Emilio] Univ Rafael Landivar, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Mason-Li, Mei] Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Schachner, Maja] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Sim, Samantha] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Tair, Ergyul] Bulgarian Acad Sci, BG-1040 Sofia, Bulgaria",,"Abubakar, A (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Culture Studies, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",A.AbubakarAli@uvt.nl,"van de Vijver, Fons/A-4317-2012; Schachner, Maja/S-2262-2018; Kamble, Shanmukh Vasant/ABE-6993-2021; Gillath, Omri/A-8171-2009; Karakulak, Arzu/K-8481-2019; Aldhafri, Said S./A-9355-2017; Adams, Byron/H-3098-2018; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/B-5095-2011; Fischer, Ronald/G-6447-2017","van de Vijver, Fons/0000-0003-0220-2485; Aldhafri, Said S./0000-0002-1776-263X; Adams, Byron/0000-0001-5968-1996; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/0000-0002-4638-085X; Fischer, Ronald/0000-0002-3055-3955; Gillath, Omri/0000-0001-8791-227X; kamble, shanmukh/0000-0002-2185-8052; Sembiring Pandia, Weny Savitry/0000-0002-6878-0571; Suryani, Angela Oktavia/0000-0001-5016-4802; Spencer, Rosario/0000-0002-4546-4226",,,,35,21,21,1,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0734-2829,1557-5144,,J PSYCHOEDUC ASSESS,J.

This method is presented together with evidence supporting its advantages. At a microscopic level, the simulator shows the mutual transformation of A molecules into B molecules and vice versa for the reversible one-step chemical reaction, A(g) double left right arrow B(g). The user defines the reaction as endothermic or exothermic and sets a given reaction temperature; SEQ-alfa (c) then calculates the kinetic constants of the forward and reverse reactions. Based on initial given concentrations, the animation then evaluates the respective rates and concentrations, as well as the concentration quotient value, as the reaction progresses towards its equilibrium state. SEQ-alfa (c) also demonstrates the effects of concentration and temperature alterations on the reaction's progress and the value of the reaction quotient until equilibrium is reached, thus giving the equilibrium constant. In addition, a validation of this new approach was carried out with 27 teachers. A pre-test and post-test of students' understanding of the basic concepts of chemical equilibrium were conducted. Tested groups attained a 50% average learning gain (n(exp) = 130, n(ctrl) = 26). Those students with little or no previous knowledge acquired a better understanding of chemical equilibrium. In addition, 80% of teachers agreed that the multimedia resource and its complementary activities had positive effects.","[Ollino, Mario; Aldoney, Jenny; Dominguez, Ana M.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Merino, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Dominguez, AM (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.; Merino, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",mario.ollino@usm.cl; jenny.aldoney@usm.cl; anamaria.dominguez@usm.cl; cristian.merino@pucv.cl,"Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019","Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Aldoney, Jenny/0000-0003-3095-5433",Office of General Teaching at the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (DGD); Teaching and Learning Office (DEA) as part of the Olivier Espinoza Aldunate [UTFSM-OEA/2015]; Fondecyt from the Chilean Government's National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [1150659],The researchers gratefully acknowledge financial support from The Office of General Teaching at the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria (DGD) and the Teaching and Learning Office (DEA) as part of the Olivier Espinoza Aldunate (UTFSM-OEA/2015) Education Research Project; and from Fondecyt Project 1150659 from the Chilean Government's National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT).,,26,4,4,3,24,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1109-4028,,,CHEM EDUC RES PRACT,Chem.

This tool was applied to analyze the presentation of the concept of osmosis in 16 chemistry and biology books at different educational levels. The results showed that more than 50% of the books present the process of osmosis connected just with concentration properties associated with the hydrodynamic state of the osmotic process, forgetting the properties of osmotic pressure to define the state of osmotic equilibrium. This omission creates confusion between the state of osmotic equilibrium with the isotonic state by reducing the entire osmosis process to a mere process of diffusion by differences in concentrations. Moreover, in 4 of the biology textbooks, the presentation of the osmosis concept and osmotic equilibrium in cell system illustrations generates confusion between hydrostatic pressure generated by gravity vs. hydrostatic pressure generated by membrane tension or turgor pressure. Our results show that in most of the texts, the osmotic process is not connected with the non-equilibrium state, macroscopic dynamic state or equilibrium state, whereas in other textbooks, equivalence between these states and hypo-hyper and isotonic states is incorrectly presented.","[Spinelli Barria, Michele; Morales, Cecilia; Merino, Cristian; Quiroz, Waldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile",,"Quiroz, W (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile.",waldo.quiroz@pucv.cl,"Merino, Cristian/D-1651-2016; Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019","Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581",VRIEA of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [DREAMS 0.37.307/2015]; Magister en Didactica de las Ciencias Experimentales'' of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; CONICYTPCHA/Magister Nacional [2015-22151311],This scientific product is derived from FONDECYT research 1150659 CONICYT - CHILE and the VRIEA of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (project DREAMS 0.37.307/2015).

The tool is able to identify errors of different types: (1) epistemological, in which the law is incorrectly presented as data correlation instead of as a pattern of causality; (2) semantic, in which natural law is presented as a mathematical statement that relates variables but with an absence of ambiguous material reference; (3) deterministic, in which the relationship of natural variables is presented but with no causality statement; and (4) mechanistic, in which a causality statement is presented with the absence of an explanatory mechanism. In this work, Boyle's law was used as an example of the applicability of the instrument. In this case, we found errors in most of the university textbooks that we analyzed. Most of the errors arose from the disconnection between the symbolic and microscopic levels. The presentations of Boyle's law in general chemistry are given in textbooks that include illustrations based in a macroscopic perspective, in which the macroscopic compression mechanism is completely disconnected from the microscopic collision mechanism. This disconnection results in the incorrect presentation of gas pressure as the cause and gas volume as the effect.","[Quiroz, Waldo; Merino Rubilar, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile",,"Quiroz, W (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Quim, Campus Curauma,Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso 2373223, Chile.",waldo.quiroz@ucv.cl,"Merino, Cristian/D-1651-2016; Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019","Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581",CONICYT - CHILEComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT),Scientific product derived from FONDECYT research 1150659.

The test was analyzed for content, taxonomy of questions asked (1: direct recall; 2: diagnosis; 3: evaluation/decision-making), residents' performance, difficulty index and discrimination index. Results: During the years of EMNOT administration, the most frequently tested areas have been pediatric orthopaedics (22.9 %), spine (13.8 %), general orthopaedics (13.8 %) and musculoskeletal trauma (9.9 %). A significant increase in questions with images was observed, as well as a significant decrease in the percentage of Type 1 and an increase in Type 3 questions. The Difficulty Index showed a medium level of difficulty for all years the examination has been administered. The Discrimination Index showed good discrimination in 2009, fair discrimination from 2010 through 2012, and excellent discrimination from 2013 through 2015. Conclusion: The EMNOT has evolved over several years to include better quality questions, better discrimination, and a more representative distribution of questions covering the different orthopaedic sub-specialties. This examination represents an effective instrument for quality assurance of orthopaedic residency programs in Chile.","[Urrutia, Julio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Marcoleta 352, Santiago, Chile; [Orrego, Mario; Amenabar, Diego] Univ Los Andes, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Santiago, Chile; [Wright, Ana C.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Ctr Med Educ, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile",,"Urrutia, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Marcoleta 352, Santiago, Chile.",jurrutia@med.puc.cl,"amenabar, diego/AAC-7687-2019",,,,,17,1,1,0,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1472-6920,,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

The results reveal that 8 of the 15 textbooks incorrectly present work w'' as a property, while 7 textbooks incorrectly present heat q'' as a property. Furthermore, 3 textbooks present the concept of energy as a property and assign it a merely operational definition as the capacity to do work.

The purpose of this study was to to describe family medicine graduates' perceived experience with intimidation, harassment and discrimination (IHD) during residency training.MethodsA mixed-methods study was conducted on a cohort of family medicine graduates who completed residency training during 2006-2011. Phase 1, the quantitative component, consisted of a retrospective survey of 651 graduates. Phase 2, the qualitative component, was comprised of 11 qualitative interviews. Both the survey and the interviews addressed graduates' experience with IHD with respect to frequency and type, setting, perpetrator, perceived basis for IHD, and the effect of the IHD.ResultsThe response rate to the survey was 47.2%, with 44.7% of respondents indicating that they experienced some form of mistreatment/IHD during residency training, and 69.9% noting that it occurred more than once. The primary sources of IHD were specialist physicians (75.7%), hospital nurses (47.8%), and family physicians (33.8%). Inappropriate verbal comments were the most frequent type of IHD (86.8%). Graduates perceived the basis of the IHD to be abuse of power (69.1%), personality conflict (36.8%), and family medicine as a career choice (30.1%), which interview participants also described. A significantly greater proportion IMGs than CMGs perceived the basis of IHD to be culture/ethnicity (47.2% vs 10.5%, respectively). The vast majority (77.3%) of graduates reported that the IHD experience had a negative effect on them, consisting of decreased self-esteem and confidence, increased anxiety, and sleep problems. As trainees, they felt angry, threatened, demoralized, discouraged, manipulated, and powerless. Some developed depression or burnout, took medication, or underwent counselling.ConclusionsIHD continued to be prevalent during family medicine residency training, with it occurring most frequently in the hospital setting and specialty rotations. Educational institutions must work with hospital administrators to address issues of mistreatment in the workplace. Residency training programs and the medical establishment need to be cognizant that the effects of IHD are far-reaching and must continuously work to eradicate it.","[Szafran, Olga] Univ Alberta, Dept Family Med, 6-10 Univ Terrace, Edmonton, AB T6G 2T4, Canada; [Woloschuk, Wayne] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Room 701B,3330 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Torti, Jacqueline M.

In particular, our study participants were asked to explain why a mixture of water and alcohol works as an antifreeze. Data collected in the form of written explanations were analysed using a mechanistic reasoning framework based on the characterisation of system components (e.g., entities, properties, activities, organisation) and paying attention to the causal models invoked by the participants in their explanations. Our analysis revealed that students at the same educational level construct a wide range of explanations for the same phenomenon that are indicative of different reasoning modes going from descriptive to relational to simple causal to emerging mechanistic. Although the explanations generated by students in our sample were not very sophisticated in terms of the causal models on which they relied, some participants were capable of generating mechanistic explanations using particulate models of matter. The framework for analysis introduced in this contribution can be of use to teachers and researchers in the characterisation of student reasoning.","[Moreira, Patricia; Marzabal, Ainoa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Talanquer, Vicente] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Moreira, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",pmmoreira@uc.cl,"; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017","Talanquer, Vicente/0000-0002-5737-3313; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889",FONDECYT in ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160148];  [CONICYT-21161280],"This work was supported by CONICYT-21161280, which provided a scholarship for the first author of this paper, and by the research project FONDECYT 1160148 in Chile.",,47,12,12,3,17,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1109-4028,1756-1108,,CHEM EDUC RES PRACT,Chem.

In this qualitative research study, we analysed changes in the reasoning expressed by 10th grade students in a Chilean school in their written explanations about freezing point depression before and after a lesson on the topic. We also investigated how the teacher's interventions shaped the type of reasoning expressed by participating students. Our findings revealed significant shifts in the types of explanations generated after the lesson. A significant number of students transitioned from relational to simple causal reasoning in their pre- and post-lesson explanations. After the lesson most of the explanations were based on the activities of one or more of the system's entities. Analysis of teacher-student interactions during the observed lesson suggests that the teacher's mediation played a central role in the shift towards simple causal reasoning with centralized causality that was observed. The teacher in our study was more skilled at eliciting students' ideas than at helping students develop them with proper scaffolding. Thus, the observed classroom talk could not be considered as accountable talk, as most of the key ideas were introduced, selected, or reshaped by the teacher.","[Moreira, Patricia; Marzabal, Ainoa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Talanquer, Vicente] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Moreira, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",pmmoreira@uc.cl; vicente@u.arizona.edu,"; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017","Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Talanquer, Vicente/0000-0002-5737-3313",CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECA DOCTORADO NACIONAL [2016 - 21161280]; FONDECYT in ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1160148],This work was funded by the CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECA DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2016 - 21161280 and by the research project FONDECYT 1160148 in Chile.,,46,3,3,1,17,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1109-4028,1756-1108,,CHEM EDUC RES PRACT,Chem.

Based on the frameworks introduced by telepresence and media richness theories, and following a constructivist-based learning approach, we argue that the greater the similarity of an online museum experience is to its physical counterpart, the more positive will be the observer's perception of the collection. We reason that the similarity would lead online visitors to develop greater cognitive involvement which in turn will produce more positive attitudes toward the collection. In support of this argument, we present the results of a comparative study in which 565 participants were exposed randomly to four different exhibitions: two-dimensional collections of art and aircraft museums and three-dimensional tours of similar museums. Results indicate that whereas 3D tours have a strong effect on users' intentions to visit the real museum, cognitive involvement and sense of presence mediate the association between these variables. In terms of managerial implications, our study shows that if educational professionals want to stimulate their students to visit museums, 3D tours appear to be more effective for engaging learners through a realistic-looking environment. By offering richer perceptual cues and multimodal feedback (e.g., users can view 3D objects from multiple viewpoints or zoom in/out the objects), the study suggests that participants may increase their reasoning process and become more interested in cultural content.","[Katz, James E.] Boston Univ, Div Emerging Media Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Halpern, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Halpern, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",Katz2020@bu.edu; dmhalper@uc.cl,,,,,,41,12,14,7,83,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1059-0145,1573-1839,,J SCI EDUC TECHNOL,J.

In this pilot study, we investigate the relationship between dyad training on stress, anxiety, cognitive load, and performance in a simulated bradycardia scenario.MethodsForty-one fourth-year medical school trainees were randomized as dyads (n=24) or individuals (n=17) for an education session on day 1. Reassessment occurred on day 4 and was completed as individuals for all trainees. Primary outcomes were cognitive load (Paas scale), stress (Cognitive Appraisal Ratio), and anxiety levels (abbreviated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes were time-based performance metrics.ResultsOn day 1 we observed significant differences for change in anxiety and stress measured before and after the training scenario between groups. Individuals compared to dyads had larger mean increases in anxiety, (19.6 versus 7.6 on 80-point scale, p=0.02) and stress ratio (1.8 versus 0.9, p=0.045). On the day 4 post-intervention assessment, no significant differences were observed between groups. Secondary outcomes were significant for shorter time to diagnosis of bradycardia (p=0.01) and time to initiation of pacing (p=0.04) in the dyad group on day 1. On day 4, only time to recognizing the indication for pacing was significantly shorter for individual training (hazard ratio [HR]=2.26, p=0.02).ConclusionsDyad training results in lower stress and anxiety levels with similar performance compared to individual training.","[Abbott, Eduardo F.; Laack, Torrey A.] Mayo Clin, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Internal Med, Escuela Med, Diagonal Paraguay 362,5th Floor, Santiago 8330077, Chile; [Laack, Torrey A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Licatino, Lauren K.; Warner, Paul A.; Torsher, Laurence C.] Dept Anesthesia & Perioperat Med, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Wood-Wentz, Christina M.] Mayo Clin, Div Clin Trials & Biostat, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Newman, James S.; Rieck, Katie M.] Mayo Clin, Div Hosp Internal Med, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA",,"Laack, TA (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.; Laack, TA (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",Laack.Torrey@mayo.edu,,,Mayo Clinic Simulation Center - Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine,This work was supported by internal funds from the Mayo Clinic Simulation Center.

The present study aimed to adapt and validate a shortened version of Bauer's Attitude toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory version 2 (ASCIv2) for use in a Latin American context. It also explored attitudes towards chemistry of Chilean secondary school students, and assessed the effect of school type, year group, gender, and chemistry achievement on both cognitive and affective dimensions. The participants were 523 secondary school students from public, private subsidised, and private schools in Chile. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were first carried out to validate ASCIv2. The results of CFA showed that ASCIv2 retained the two-factor structure and showed optimal model fit, but three items had to be removed from the original instrument. The research also showed that attitudes towards science were neither positive nor negative, a reality similar to that of other countries. The results of multivariate and univariate analyses of variance showed significant effects of year group and chemistry achievement on attitudes towards chemistry. No effects of school type, gender or interactions between factors were found. Follow-up analyses revealed that as students advance through school their attitudes decline, but that the higher their chemistry marks, the more positive their attitudes become.

It has been proposed that student-centred pedagogy can achieve motivation and improve learning. In this context, this case study reports the use of art as a strategy to engage students in studying and learning biochemistry. Three Art & Biochemistry sessions were included in the programme of the Biochemistry course of first-year veterinary medicine students as one of the graded activities. Working as a team, students expressed a biochemical concept or process of their choice through any art representation to their classmates and to a panel of professors, both of which evaluated their performance using a global perspective rubric. The students' assessment of the activity over three consecutive years suggests that the Art & Biochemistry sessions were successful as an approach to motivate them, and were also perceived as helpful to the understanding and learning of biochemistry. This report supports a positive relationship between art and science in enhancing self-learning and could be easily applied to other subjects and disciplines.","[Bruna, Carola] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Concepcion, Chile",,"Bruna, C (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Biol, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",carolabruna@udec.cl,,"Bruna, Carola/0000-0003-0554-7147",,,,15,2,2,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-9266,2157-6009,,J BIOL EDUC,J.

The initial differences identified in the development of written language precursors are directly related to subsequent students' academic trajectories. Socioeconomic status is a significant source of initial differences in performance, with discrepancies in the development of reading precursors favoring children from more affluent backgrounds. We assessed reading precursors in 176 Chilean children from different socioeconomic levels. Significant differences in performance were found, which tended to favor the higher socioeconomic groups for each precursor we tested. However, the developmental trajectories of skills were similar for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and oral comprehension. A compensatory trajectory was observed only in the case of rapid naming. The problem arises from the need for educational systems to adapt to the specific needs of their students, in order to generate compensatory trajectories in all reading precursor skills and enable a decrease in the gaps in reading performance among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds.","[Espinoza, Victoria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Victoria; Santa Cruz, Catalina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Ctr Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Rosas, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Espinoza, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Vicua Mackenna 4860, Chile.",victoriaespinoza@uc.cl,,"Santa Cruz, Catalina/0000-0002-1074-6207",Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [ANID PIA CIE160007],The present research was financially supported by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo ANID PIA CIE160007.,,77,0,0,4,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1057-3569,1521-0693,,READ WRIT Q,Read.

The students' abilities to recognize the three representations of the electric field and do conversions gave insight into their understanding of this concept. We used the theory of registers of semiotic representations as a framework to analyze the data. Our results showed that the direction of the conversion is an essential factor in determining the students' success in performing conversions of electrical field representations. We found close synergy between the vector field plot and the algebraic notation of the electric field. However, we found that the conversions that involve electric field lines do not present synergy. The electric field lines representation is especially difficult for students, both as a source and as a target representation, specifically, the interpretation and representation of the magnitude of the field through the density of field lines. We recommend that teachers and researchers of electricity and magnetism be more conscious of the difficulties that some conversion tasks may present to their students. We specifically invite instructors to he attentive to how they approach the representation of electric field lines and be explicit when performing conversions that involve electric field lines.","[Campos, Esmeralda; Zavala, Genaro] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, E Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Zavala, Genaro] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 810, Santiago 7500971, Chile; [Zuza, Kristina; Guisasola, Jenaro] Univ Basque Country, Donostia Phys Educ Res Grp, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Zuza, Kristina; Guisasola, Jenaro] Sch Engn Gipuzkoa UPV EHU, Appl Phys Dept, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain",,"Zavala, G (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, E Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico.; Zavala, G (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 810, Santiago 7500971, Chile.",genaro.zavala@tec.mx,"Zavala, Genaro/P-7190-2016; Guisasola, Jenaro/L-9040-2014; Zuza, Kristina/K-7973-2014","Zavala, Genaro/0000-0001-5880-1124; Guisasola, Jenaro/0000-0002-0817-3905; Zuza, Kristina/0000-0002-4455-0165","School of Engineering and Sciences of Tecnologico de Monterrey; Basque GovernmentBasque Government [PIBA IT1349-19]; Spanish Government MINECOSpanish Government [EDU2015-65359-P]; Writing Lab, TecLabs, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico","We thank Dr. J.

The most significant changes are (i) the addition and removal of items to achieve parallelism in the objectives (dimensions) of the test, thus allowing comparisons of students' performance that were not possible with the original version, and (ii) changes to the distractors of some of the original items that represent the most frequent alternative conceptions. The final modified version (after an iterative process involving four administrations of test variations over two years) was administered to 471 students of an introductory university physics course at a large private university in Mexico. When analyzing the final modified version of the test it was found that the added items satisfied the statistical tests of difficulty, discriminatory power, and reliability; also, that the great majority of the modified distractors were effective in terms of their frequency selection and discriminatory power; and, that the final modified version of the test satisfied the reliability and discriminatory power criteria as well as the original test. Here, we also show the use of the new version of the test, presenting a new analysis of students' understanding not possible to do before with the original version of the test, specifically regarding the objectives and items that in the new version meet parallelisms.

Simulations that mirror the complex realities of clinical practice have the potential to induce a range of emotions, without a clear understanding of their impact on learning and the learner. Students' emotional states have important effects on their learning process that can be either positive or negative, and are often difficult to predict. We aimed to determine: (1) To what extent achievement emotions are experienced by medical students during a complex simulation based learning activity, i.e. a ward round simulation (WRS). (2) What their performance scores are and too which extent performance scores do correlate with emotions and 3) how these emotions are perceived to impact learning. Methods A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Using an Achievement Emotion Questionnaire, we explored undergraduate medical student's emotions as they participated in a complex ward round-based simulation. Their performance was rated using an observational ward round assessment tool and correlated with emotions scores. Six focus groups were conducted to provide a deeper understanding of their emotional and learning experiences. Results Students experienced a range of emotions during the simulation, they felt proud, enjoyed the simulation and performed well. Students felt proud because they could show in the complex simulation what they had learned so far. Students reported moderate levels of anxiety and low levels of frustration and shame. We found non-significant correlations between achievement emotions and performance during ward round simulation. Conclusions Placing undergraduate students in high complex simulations that they can handle raises positive academic achievement emotions which seem to support students' learning and motivation.","[Behrens, Claudia C.] Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; [Dolmans, Diana H.; Driessen, Erik W.] Maastricht Univ, Sch Hlth Profess Educ, Univ Singel 60, NL-6229 ER Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gormley, Gerard J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Educ, Univ Rd, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",,"Behrens, CC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile.",cbehrens@ucn.cl,,"Behrens, Claudia/0000-0001-9859-7295",,,,29,2,4,3,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6920,,BMC MED EDUC,BMC Med.

Medical education has slowly adjusted to these reforms, although the region is still at risk to have a chronic shortage of family doctors. This paper presents the evaluation of a new post-graduate family medicine program in Tajikistan, focused on competency-based training. The findings are relevant for policy makers, international organizations and practitioners participating in similar medical education reform programs. Methods We employed a quasi-experimental control group design and compared intervention residents, control group residents with traditional training, and 1st year residents with no training in two outcomes, clinical knowledge and competencies. We employed two objective measures, a written multiple-choice question test (MCQT) and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), respectively. We report reliability and validity of the measures along with ANOVA, planned contrasts and effect size estimates to examine differences across groups. Results We found statistically significant differences in both clinical knowledge and competencies between intervention and control groups. We also detected a large intervention effect size. Participants in the intervention outperformed control group participants in the two measures. Our analysis suggests that intervention and control group participants are comparable in terms of initial knowledge and competencies, strengthening the argument that the intervention caused the improvement in the program outcomes. Discussion Receiving tailored training and structured opportunities to practice knowledge and competencies in clinical settings have a positive effect on the education of family medicine doctors in Tajikistan. Our results support curriculum reform and investment in medical education in the form of longer and supervised on-the-job preparation designed to be more in line with international standards. We discuss suggestions for future studies and potential requirements to inform replicability in other countries. Conclusion Family medicine is well recognized as central to health systems throughout the world, but high quality residency training lags behind in some countries. Our study showed that investing in family medicine residency programs and structured training is effective in increasing critical clinical competencies. We encourage promoting comprehensive post graduate family medicine doctor training so that the goals of a family medicine centered health system are attainable.","[Bohle, Leah F.; Yarbaeva, Shakhlo N.; Prytherch, Helen] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland; [Bohle, Leah F.; Prytherch, Helen] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ross, Greta] Independent Hlth Consultant, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ross, Greta; Dzhabarovna, Davlyatova Dilbar; Yarbaeva, Shakhlo N.; Kasymova, Zukhra A.] Med Educ Reform Project Tajikistan, Dushanbe, Tajikistan; [Dzhabarovna, Davlyatova Dilbar] Inst Postgrad Educ Healthcare Republ Tajikist, Dept Family Med, Dushanbe, Tajikistan",,"Bohle, LF (corresponding author), Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland.; Bohle, LF (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",leah.bohle@swisstph.ch,"Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019","Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,"The study was conducted within the Medical Education Project of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Tajikistan.

Socio-constructivism provides a solid base to explain how teamwork can foster innovation through the use of cultural artifacts, such as boundary objects. The purpose of this paper describing the anatomy of negotiation within several teams of engineering students located in universities of Northern California and Santiago de Chile from 2010 to 2017. We propose the concept of conflict orchestration to explain the dynamics of engineering teams working on innovation-driven engineering design challenges. A context sensitive qualitative research design was deployed using an ethnographic approach to the study team negotiation patterns observed in 11 teams of engineering students from Northern California and Santiago de Chile. The methodological focus was on identifying commonalities in the use of boundary objects and trading zones emerging from the students' team interaction. Our findings illustrate two distinct strategies that the engineering teams adopted using boundary objects. We describe the use of Sticky Notes and Third Platforms. Finally, we explore students' perceptions of the educational gain of PBL engineering design courses. The relevance of this study is threefold. First it conceptualizes a teamwork phenomenon that energizes innovation through scaffolded conflict. We also explore how this concept is enacted by engineering teams in two different cultural sites. Finally, we provide bottom-up strategies that can be implemented in other undergraduate engineering design programs.","[Miranda, Constanza; Goni, Julian] Pontificia Univ Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Miranda, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile.",csmirand@uc.cl; jvgoni@uc.cl; ihillige@ing.puc.cl,"Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020; Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022","Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416",,,,68,3,3,4,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to characterise the nature of the change in student thinking about evolution through the mechanism of natural selection during a six-lesson intervention with a group of ninth-grade students (14-15 years old) from a private subsidised school in Chile. The study group included thirteen students to whom a pre- and post-test was applied using the questionnaire Assessment of Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORNS), and from whom short tasks were collected at the end of three lessons. The data were analysed using a quantitative and qualitative analysis of nine students grouped in five cases of study. The main patterns described here are the recurrence of the design teleology thinking in students, the initial use of key concepts such as mutation, survival, and differential reproduction during the trajectories, the abundance of mixed thinking during and at the end of the instruction, and the low coherence in the structure of thinking, both in time and through the different contexts analysed.","[Parraguez, Carolina; Nunez, Paola; Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Kruger, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@pucv.cl,,,"International Cooperation program for attraction of advanced human capital, [Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica] [MEC 80180066]; Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development [FONDECYT]Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181801]","This study was supported by the International Cooperation program for attraction of advanced human capital, [Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica MEC 80180066] and by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development [FONDECYT] grant number [1181801], both to HC.",,42,2,2,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-9266,2157-6009,,J BIOL EDUC,J.

The aim of the present study was to describe and characterise knowledge about evolution among 120 freshman undergraduate students of two natural sciences programmes (environmental biology and veterinary medicine), 80 pre-service science teachers (elementary and biology) and 45 in-service teachers (elementary and biology high school) in Santiago, Chile. The research was carried out based on an eight-question questionnaire about evolution acceptance and understanding. The instrument included seven Likert-scale questions and one open-ended question. An analysis of the data revealed that more than 70% of teachers (pre-service and in-service) and undergraduate students recognised the theory of evolution as established scientific knowledge. When participants discussed the mechanism of evolution in the open-ended question, the most prevalent responses from students and teachers (33%) explained evolution as need-driven changes for survival purposes. Only 13% of the responses could be considered Darwinian, and 10% of responses included more than one view of evolution. The Darwinian responses generally included three important aspects: variation, inheritance and differential reproduction. The implications for biology teacher education are also discussed in this study.","[Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile; [Jimenez, Juan] IIT, Math & Sci Educ Dept, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Santibanez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Claudia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile",,"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@ucv.cl,,", hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457","Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1,131,029]","This work was partially supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), under Grant 1,131,029 to the first author.",,39,13,13,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-9266,2157-6009,,J BIOL EDUC,J.

Several factors influence clinicians' inclination towards research: the medical school experience, exposure to research article reading and writing, and knowledge of research. This cohort study follows up medical students at time of graduation to explore changes in their inclination towards research and pursuing a research career compared to their inclination at time of entry into medical school. Methods: Students from medical schools in six different countries were enrolled in their first year of school and followed-up upon graduation in their final year. Students answered the same self-administered questionnaire at both time points. Changes in inclination towards research and pursuing a research career were assessed. Factors correlated with these changes were analysed. Results: Of the 777 medical students who responded to the study questionnaire at entry into medical school, 332 (42.7%) completed the follow-up survey. Among these 332 students, there was no significant increase in inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Students from a United States based school, in contrast to those from schools other countries, were more likely to report having research role models to guide them (51.5% vs. 0%-26.4%) and to have published in a peer-reviewed journal (75.7% vs. 8.9%-45%). Absence of a role model was significantly associated with a decrease in inclination towards research, while an increased desire to learn more about statistics was significantly associated with an increase in inclination towards pursuing a research career. Conclusion: Most medical students did not experience changes in their inclination towards research or pursuing a research career over the course of their medical schooling. Factors that increased their inclination to undertaking research or pursuing a research career were availability of a good role model, and a good knowledge of both the research process and the analytical tools required.","[Ha, Tam Cam; Yong, Sook Kwin; Tan, Say Beng; Malhotra, Rahul; Ostbye, Truls] Natl Univ Singapore, Duke NUS Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Ha, Tam Cam] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Ng, Sheryl; Chen, Cynthia; Koh, Gerald C.

In this study, approaches to teaching ranged from a focus on the teacher and the taught content to a focus on the student and their learning, resembling those reported in previous investigations. Approaches to e-teaching ranged from a focus on information transmission to a focus on communication and collaboration. An analysis of perceptions of the teaching situation in relation to e-learning identified key themes influencing adopted approaches: control of teaching, institutional strategy, pedagogical and technological support, time required, teacher skills for using e-learning, and student abilities and willingness for using learning technology. Associations between these elements showed three groups of teachers: one focusing on transmission of information teaching both face-to-face and online while having a general negative perception of the teaching situation in relation to e-learning; a second focusing on student learning both face-to-face and online while having a general positive perception; and a third presenting unexpected patterns of associations. These results may be helpful for supporting different groups of teachers in employing e-learning in their on-campus units of study. At the same time, further research is proposed for inquiring into specific approaches in different disciplines and different university contexts.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Gonzalez, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",cgonzalu@uc.cl,"Gonz‡lez, Carlos/D-7228-2017","Gonz‡lez, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777",,,,35,22,22,0,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0020-4277,1573-1952,,INSTR SCI,Instr.

Academic reading motivation is conceptualised from the Expectancy-Value Theory, with the respective eponymous dimensions as well as interest, attainment, utility, and cost as subcomponents for task value. MethodsThese motivational variables were measured by the Escala Motivacional por la Lectura Academica (Academic Reading Motivation Scale). Analysis focused on confirming the demotivation process organised by four different educational motivation profile types (clusters), as well as by cohorts. Participants were a total of 785 elementary preservice teachers from seven Chilean universities, both public and private, from six regions of Chile, enrolled in the first, third and last years of their programme. This population was tested, with a subsample (n = 295) retested the following year. ResultsResults show a concentration of negative motivational changes in the school motivation group, as well as changes during the first years of the programme. The more affected dimensions are utility and cost. There is no evidence for changes in feeling of competence for academic reading (expectancy). ConclusionsWe conclude the importance of focusing efforts on avoiding these negative motivational changes in students that demonstrate three key characteristics: they want to become primary teachers, they are engaged in their studies, and finally, they want to work in the school system. HighlightsWhat is already known about this topic Academic reading is fundamental for professional training. There is evidence of motivational changes during teacher training. What this paper adds Shows evidence of demotivation in academic reading during teaching training. Identifies when these changes occur. Identifies the dimensions of academic reading motivation that change significantly. Identifies the profiles of students who are most affected by these changes. Implications for theory, policy or practice Alert about the lack of motivation for academic reading in the pedagogy students because of the impact this may have on the quality of future teachers. Suggests paying special attention to students with a vocation for school teaching.","[Munoz, Carla] Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Psicol, Talca, Chile; [Valenzuela, Jorge] Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Ciencias Educ, Talca, Chile",,"Valenzuela, J (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Fac Ciencias Educ, Talca, Chile.",jvalenzuela@ucm.cl,"Valenzuela, Jorge/J-6070-2014; Mu–oz, Carla/P-8544-2019","Valenzuela, Jorge/0000-0002-9558-2642; Mu–oz, Carla/0000-0001-5968-6076","National Commission for Research in Science and Technology (Conicyt-Chile) through theRegular Fondecyt [1150533, 1170779, 1181159]","This research has been funded by the National Commission for Research in Science and Technology (Conicyt-Chile) through theRegular Fondecyt Projects 1150533, 1170779 and 1181159.",,89,0,0,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-0423,1467-9817,,J RES READ,J.

Among the abilities known to be relevant for young children's understanding of stories are the size of their vocabulary, their inference-making ability, and their working memory. In this study, we examine the role of other processes in explaining preschool children's story comprehension, in a sample of 257 Chilean kindergarten children from middle-income families. The processes we examine are comprehension monitoring, theory of mind, inhibition, and attention control. Mediation relations suggested by theory and previous research are examined between working memory and comprehension, through integrative processes, and between vocabulary breadth and comprehension, through vocabulary depth. We use two different measures of story comprehension to clarify the role that each predictor plays in different aspects of this complex skill. Results suggest that when the story comprehension measure requires construction of a coherent representation, vocabulary, monitoring, inferences, working memory, inhibitory skill, and attention, but not theory of mind, make a significant contribution. Effects of vocabulary breadth are mediated by vocabulary depth, and effects of working memory are partially mediated by monitoring and inferences. When story comprehension is measured through recall of isolated story elements, only working memory and vocabulary explain significant variance. Theoretical as well as practical implications are discussed.","[Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [del Rio, Francisca] Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile.",kstrasse@uc.cl; francisca.delrio@mail.udp.cl,,"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; del Rio, M.

While a large body of research has addressed reading comprehension and written production independently, very little investigation has examined the possible relationships between these two psycholinguistic processes, particularly from a discourse and cognitive perspective. Argumentative texts were analyzed in the present investigation on reading-writing connections. Four tests were designed and tested on 439 eighth graders. The tests assessed psycholinguistic variables that account for the microstructural, macrostructural and superstructural levels of comprehension/production processing.

A total of 102 participants were evaluated with RAN letters, phonological awareness, counting, arithmetical fluency, inhibition and verbal working memory. Results show moderate correlations between RAN and counting with arithmetical fluency. After controlling for the effect of all the variables, RAN still explains a significant variance of arithmetical fluency. Although the nature of the relationship between RAN and arithmetical fluency is multi-componential, our results only confirm the role of working memory when simultaneous counting is considered in the model. Therefore, RAN is not only an important cognitive variable related to reading processes but also a key one for mathematical skills, especially when they involve a fluency component.","[Escobar, Jose-Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Dev Inclus Technol, Santiago, Chile; [Porflitt, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Ceric, Francisco] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Escobar, JP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus CEDETI UC, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.",jpescobar@uc.cl,,"Porflitt, Felipe/0000-0001-9789-9080; Escobar, Jose-Pablo/0000-0001-9749-0285",FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141083],This work was supported by Fondecyt under Grant 1141083.,,83,0,0,4,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-3410,1469-5820,,EDUC PSYCHOL-UK,Educ.

This paper examines if the performance of native Spanish speakers is affected by EMI. Specifically, it discusses experiences from finance and industrial organization courses given to industrial engineers at a Chilean university. The results of a multivariate analysis of tests and final grades show that performance differences can mainly be attributed to students' performance in previous courses; only on rare occasions do language, gender, and attendance explain performance differences.","[Reus, Lorenzo] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile",,"Reus, L (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",lorenzo.reus@uai.cl,"Reus, Lorenzo/D-7112-2016","Reus, Lorenzo/0000-0001-9171-7688",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170012],Lorenzo Reus acknowledges financial support research for this study was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [#11170012].,,68,0,0,2,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0191-491X,,,STUD EDUC EVAL,Stud.

In this scenario, there needs to be a renewed attention to the instilment of general epistemic beliefs that facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and the incorporation of social science practices. In other words, there is a need for a social turn in engineering education. In the following case study, we examine the learning process of 45 undergraduate engineering students enrolled in an Anthro-Design course at a private university in Chile. This course teaches students to use cultural anthropology and design tools to generate an applied qualitative research project for real-life counterparts. Under a socio-constructivist approach, we developed a sequential explanatory design, with an emphasis on qualitative data [quant- > QUAL]. We used the three factor Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI) to conduct pre-post assessment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the course to explore representations of key epistemic notions such as objectivity and validity. This study identifies a significant diversity in how epistemic notions such as validity and objectivity are represented by students after undertaking a course that embraces the social turn. This diversity can also be observed in non-epistemic notions related to the learning experience. We argue that a better understanding of the research process and the handling of qualitative information under rigorous theoretical frameworks are key to changing beliefs about the nature of knowledge within the engineering-design students' context.","[Miranda, Constanza] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Goni, Julian; Sotomayor, Trinidad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Miranda, C (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",constanzamiranda@jhu.edu,"Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020","Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416",,,,102,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

In this article, we will discuss the instrument called Technology and Engineering Attitude Scale (TEAS) which focuses on attitudes towards technology. Previous studies and applications of this particular scale lacked proper statistical validation of the instrument. The following research looks at the application of an adapted version of the TEAS to assess a GEDC awarded pre-engineering design program in Chile. This version was psychometrically analyzed in 436 cases to validate the interpretations driven by a particular cultural context and specific to the discipline of engineering. The article focuses on the modifications applied to the instrument after the statistical validity process. The discussion is centered on the ethical importance of adapting an existing scale in a valid and reliable way to assess a pre-engineering design program in a local context.

Addressing this gap, this study examines the relationship between center-based care attendance during toddler years and children's cognitive outcomes. Research Findings: Data used for this study came from the first and second wave of the Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood (ELPI, 2010 and 2012). The nationally representative sample was 1,544 children aged 12 to 24 months in 2010, who received full-time home care during this period. Propensity score matching (PSM) and difference-in-differences techniques were used in the study. Compared to those in full-time home care, children who attended center-based care from the age of 24 months had higher cognitive scores in the endline (they were measured at some point between 36 and 48 months old). Children in center-based care scored higher on cognitive skills compared to children who were in full-time home care, according to the Child Development and Cognitive Evaluation Test (Test de Aprendizaje y Desarrollo Infantil, TADI) and the Battelle test (d = .21 p p < .01, respectively). However, we observed that children in low-income households benefited less from early center-based care attendance. Practice or Policy: These findings suggest that Chilean national policies supporting increased center-based care coverage in early years are a step in the right direction, but more work focused on helping disadvantaged children is needed.","[Narea, Marigen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Narea, Marigen] Ctr Adv Studies Educ Justice CJE, Santiago, Chile; [Allel, Kasim] Univ Mayor, Hlth & Soc Res Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Allel, Kasim; Arriagada, Veronica] Adv Studies Educ Justice CJE), Santiago, Chile",,"Narea, M (corresponding author), Escuela Psicol, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",mnarea@uc.cl,"Narea, Marigen/AAV-8499-2021; Narea, Marigen/AAM-5704-2020; Allel, Kasim/C-3435-2017","Narea, Marigen/0000-0001-7780-7425; Allel, Kasim/0000-0002-2144-7181; Arriagada, Veronica/0000-0002-4517-0957",CONICYT PIA [CIE160007],This article was funded by CONICYT PIA CIE160007,,73,4,4,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

Twice a week, intervention teachers filled out a checklist to monitor the language stimulation they offered children. Research personnel used the checklists to elaborate a monthly summary of the language opportunities offered to each child in that month and discussed this information with teachers. Results revealed a significant advantage for intervention teachers in frequency of book readings and word discussions but not on children's language growth. Dosage analyses showed that children identified by the self-monitoring device as receiving more language-learning opportunities improved significantly more from beginning to end of the school year in receptive vocabulary. Practice or Policy: Contextual barriers such as large numbers of children and unawareness of the impact of some language interactions can prevent teachers from engaging in important practices. Reminding teachers of the importance of those practices and helping them monitor their frequency may be a low-cost way of improving language opportunities for children in contexts where more intensive professional development is not possible.","[Strasser, Katherine; Vergara, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Mendive, Susana; Darricades, Michelle] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",kstrasse@uc.cl,"Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017","Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798",,,,79,4,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

In addition, students with higher civic knowledge were less tolerant of corruption, partially explained by authoritarianism, while open classroom discussion also had indirect associations with tolerance of corruption.","[Carrasco, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Banerjee, Robin] Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Trevino, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, CEPPE, Santiago, Chile",,"Carrasco, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile.",dacarras@uc.cl,"Villalobos, Cristobal/AAK-9559-2020; Carrasco, Diego/ABE-4483-2020; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015","Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213; Banerjee, Robin/0000-0002-4994-3611; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180667]; Ministerio de Educacion, Gobierno de Chile; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [PIA 160007]; Centro de Estudios Avanzados (CJE)","Research funded by the Ministerio de Educacion, Gobierno de Chile and Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYT (PIA 160007), Centro de Estudios Avanzados (CJE); and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYT No 1180667.",,76,3,3,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-3410,1469-5820,,EDUC PSYCHOL-UK,Educ.

Classroom observation often carries a considerable weight in teacher appraisal and improvement systems, and provides the critical formative anchor informing professional development. This study examined a purposively selected sample of sixteen classroom observation systems in six countries, including high performing Singapore and Japan, regional exemplar Chile, the three largest school districts in the United States, and other interesting examples in Australia, Germany and the United States to add diversity to the sample. The study offers an analytic framework for understanding classroom observation systems across contexts, distinguishing conceptual, methodological and policy aspects that shape these systems. The sixteen systems were remarkably consistent in their stated overall purposes, but there was variation in terms of how they operationalized good teaching, the degree of standardization of the observation process, emphasis on validation, and information uses. The paper describes and discusses these characteristics in order to help researchers and policymakers reflect on the available options and take more informed decisions in designing classroom observation for evaluating and improving teaching.

Study 1 examined the effect of word elaboration on story comprehension with 72 children. Children who were exposed to elaborations of unknown words during storybook reading achieved better comprehension than those who were not after vocabulary and narrative comprehension skills were controlled. This effect was mediated by children's learning of the elaborated words and thus provides evidence for the causal role of word knowledge in story comprehension. Study 2 examined the effect of asking questions about coherence relations versus other kinds of open-ended questions such as requests for predictions, descriptions, and real-life connections. Children exposed to coherence questions achieved better story comprehension than those exposed to other open-ended questions after initial vocabulary, narrative comprehension skills, and attentiveness were controlled. Practice or Policy: These findings suggest the use of specific reading strategies for improving comprehension. Teaching rare words and asking coherence-related questions during reading leads to better understanding of the story. These are 2 easy methods that could be integrated into daily teaching practices to help improve children's narrative comprehension.","[Strasser, Katherine; Rosa Lissi, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Strasser, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",kstrasse@uc.cl,"Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Lissi, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-9740-6853",,,,68,27,28,4,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

Teacher-child interactions were assessed when the children were 12 (n=99) and 30 months old (n=73), using the Adult Sensitivity Scale, the Evaluation of the Mentalization of the Significant Caregivers, the Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO), and Bayley's language scale for children's outcomes. Profiles were identified in person-centred within-group analyses of six dimensions: sensitivity, mentalization, affection, responsiveness, encouragement and teaching. Research Findings: Cluster analyses yielded three profiles. In the first group, profiles were organized according to their competence levels and were identified as highly, average and poorly competent. In the second group, a clearer distinction appeared between cognitive versus affective approaches, and the teachers were classified as competent cognitive, competent affective and poorly competent. Teachers' profiles were related to children's receptive language skills at both ages, and the competent cognitive profile at 30 months was a significant predictor of receptive language skills. Practice or Policy: A growing understanding of these profiles should enrich the research base and the effectiveness of promotion and intervention efforts to bridge the developmental gap observed in Chilean children.","[Farkas, Chamarrita] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Farkas, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",chfarkas@uc.cl,"Farkas, Chamarrita/C-9425-2012","Farkas, Chamarrita/0000-0002-0438-9354","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110087, 1160110]",This research was supported by funding provided by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico FONDECYT No 1110087 and 1160110.,,80,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

This study describes this competency in a sample of teachers from Chilean nurseries in interaction with 12-month-old children during a storytelling scenario and compares it with the children's mothers. The sample comprised 208 adults (104 teachers and 104 mothers). The adults were asked to tell 2 stories to the children, and these situations were recorded, transcribed, and codified using guidelines that identified 4 references to mental states (desires, cognitions, emotions, and attributes) and 4 references to nonmental states (causal and factual talk, physical states, and connections with the child's life). Research Findings: The results showed significant differences between the educational staff and the mothers, and the teachers performed better than the mothers in terms of both greater mentalization and a greater number of references to desires, causal talk, emotions, and physical states.

Of all the cognitive measures, backward digit span (BDS) tasks and RAN-Letter made significant contributions to differentiating group performance. RAN-Letter provided differentiation of groups, and BDS provided differentiation of the growth rates of both groups in number processing skills. These results highlight the relevance of RAN and BDS for the development of number processing skills in first grade, especially for MLD-at-risk children. BDS is therefore a very important task to be measured during the early stages of mathematics instruction, because it predicts deficits in development of number skills.

The present study sets out to explore whether readers' knowledge of rhetorical devices (that is, rhetorical competence) moderates their effectiveness beyond general comprehension skills and, consequently, whether rhetorical competence may be considered a component skill of reading comprehension. 192 sixth- to seventh-grade students were assessed on rhetorical competence and were required to read a difficult marked text with specific rhetorical devices (a refutation, an objective, and four organizational signals) or the same text without them. After reading, students produced a summary in order to obtain three dependent variables: main ideas (as a measure of participants' ability to select relevant information from the text), causal links between them (as an indicator of participants' ability to grasp the logical structure of the text and to organize its ideas), and the combination of main ideas plus causal links (as an indicator of participants' global comprehension of the text). Analyses controlling for general comprehension skills and other important variables (working memory, prior knowledge, decoding) demonstrated that: (a) readers of the marked text scored higher in terms of all dependent variables, and (b) rhetorical competence level moderated the effect of rhetorical devices on the composite measure (main ideas plus causal links) and on the organization of the summary by means of causal links.","[Sanchez, Emilio] Univ Salamanca, Fac Psychol, Dept Educ & Dev Psychol, Avda Merced 109-131, Salamanca 37005, Spain; [Garcia, J.

In this study, we explore a more inclusive operationalization of an academic-language proficiency construct, core academic-language skills (CALS). CALS refers to a constellation of high-utility language skills hypothesized to support reading comprehension across school content areas. Using the Core Academic Language Skills Instrument (CALS-I), a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust innovative tool, we first examined the variability in students' CALS by grade, English-proficiency designation, and socioeconomic status (SES). Then, we examined the contribution of CALS to reading comprehension using academic vocabulary knowledge, word reading fluency, and sociodemographic factors as covariates. A linguistically and socioeconomically diverse cross-sectional sample of 218 students (grades 4-6) participated in four assessments: the CALS-I, a standardized reading comprehension assessment (Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test), an academic vocabulary test (Vocabulary Association Test), and a word reading fluency test (Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency). General linear model analysis of variance revealed that CALS differed significantly by grade, English-proficiency designation, and SES, with students in higher grades, English-proficient students, and those from higher SES backgrounds displaying higher scores, on average. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified CALS as an independent predictor of reading comprehension, even after controlling for academic vocabulary knowledge, word reading fluency, and sociodemographic factors. By specifying a set of language skills associated with reading comprehension, this study advances our understanding of school-relevant language skills, making them more visible for researchers and educators.","[Uccelli, Paola; Galloway, Emily Phillips] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Barr, Christopher D.] Univ Houston, Texas Inst Measurement Evaluat & Stat, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Dobbs, Christina L.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Uccelli, P (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",paola_uccelli@gse.harvard.edu,"Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017",,,,,112,119,121,9,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-0553,1936-2722,,READ RES QUART,Read.

Participants were 180 Chilean children from backgrounds of low and high socioeconomic status (SES), their mothers, and their fathers. A path analysis was used to explore the influences of both maternal and paternal numeracy practices on children's numeracy performance and the influences of maternal and paternal expectations and anxiety on those activities. Research Findings: Results showed that mothers and fathers who endorse higher numeracy expectations for their children and who report lower levels of math anxiety also report engaging more frequently in advanced numeracy practices with their children. Mothers'-but not fathers'-engagement in numeracy practices at home predicted children's numeracy performance. Also, low-SES mothers engaged more frequently in numeracy practices with their children, and mothers in general engaged more often in numeracy activities with girls than with boys. Practice or Policy: These findings improve understanding of how maternal and paternal processes relate differently to numeracy performance in kindergarten children. Moreover, these results highlight the need to take into account parents' numeracy attitudes and practices, as well as their SES, when designing interventions directed at increasing family support for math achievement.","[Francisca del Rio, M.] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Educ, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile; [Ines Susperreguy, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Salinas, Viviana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Sociol, Santiago, Chile",,"del Rio, MF (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Sch Educ, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile.",francisca.delrio@mail.udp.cl,"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019","Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; del Rio, M.

(2) Was there gradual developmental growth of the most complex concepts' networks of associated concepts from the beginning of a program to the end? That is, for the most complex concepts, did associated concepts begin to appear in the early grades, with gradual cumulative addition of associated concepts throughout the elementary grades? Gradual accumulation of associated concepts could enable students to progressively construct a mental network of concepts within which a more complex concept could be situated, a network that could facilitate learning of most complex concepts. Two best-selling, contemporary elementary-grades core science programs constituted the data source. The researchers employed two measures: a conceptual complexity measure and the number of associated concepts (called nodes in concept networks) for each of the most complex concepts. The researchers conducted multilevel modeling and found that, on the whole, the programs exposed students to increasingly complex concepts with the rise of grades. Few highly complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Similarly, few associated concepts for the most complex concepts appeared in the earliest grades. Instead, associated concepts tended to be introduced simultaneously with the most complex concepts in the later grades. That is, on the whole, the programs did not expose students to the opportunity to construct strong affiliated concept networks (clusters of associated constructs) prior to introduction of the most complex concepts.","[Fitzgerald, W.

In European school evaluation systems, one main intended use of classroom observation results is to inform schools' instructional improvement efforts. This study examined the quality of such diagnostic information in the context of a school evaluation system in Germany. The factor analytic results indicate that the empirical structure of the observation instrument lacks correspondence with its original normative model but does mirror a five-factor model based on recent literature, including classroom management, two different aspects of student orientation, cognitive activation, and classroom assessment. The generalizability analyses show that both indicators and observers represent important sources of measurement error. Additionally, their magnitude is larger for shorter observations (lesson segments). At least two, sometimes three, observers and between five and ten indicators per dimension are needed to achieve sufficiently reliable results, but results importantly depend on which dimension of instructional quality is being assessed.

J,"Darwin, S",,,,"Darwin, Stephen",,,What contemporary work are student ratings actually doing in higher education?,studies in educational evaluation,,,English,Article,,,,,,Student ratings; Student evaluation; Higher education; Quantitative evaluation; Qualitative evaluation; Teacher development; Academic development,PROFESSIONALISM; FEEDBACK,"It is conventionally assumed that student ratings perform a significant function in driving improvement in pedagogical practices in higher education. As a result, this form of evaluation has gradually become institutionalised in recent decades as an essential proxy for understanding teaching and course quality in universities across the world. However, with the rise of market-based models in higher education and heightened expectations for accountability mechanisms, the role and functional purpose of ratings-based student evaluation have become increasingly confused. This rising ambiguity has created strong tensions between the seminal drive of student ratings as a tool of quality improvement, and the emerging demands for its use as a transparent accountability measure for the comparative assessment of academic performativity. So are student ratings now largely a tool of quality assurance or performance measurement, or do they remain a legitimate tool for pedagogical improvement? This paper reports on a study that responded to this critical question by considering the contemporary work of student ratings in a major Australian university. The outcomes of this research demonstrate that tension between improvement and accountability motives is causing considerable confusion and discord around the role and value of the student voice. It also reveals that academics are tending to discount the often critical insights of students on the implications of their pedagogical practices as a result of the elevating institutional role of student ratings as a proxy for teaching quality. In considering these outcomes, rising levels of academic dissonance around student ratings would suggest a necessity to consider broadened evaluative strategies that are able to more effectively capture the improvement potential offered by the student voice.

In English, core academic-language skills (CALS) have been found to significantly predict reading comprehension, even controlling for academic vocabulary knowledge. CALS are high-utility language skills that support reading comprehension across school content areas. Guided by an operational definition of Spanish CALS (S-CALS), three goals drove this study: to develop two psychometrically reliable tests, the S-CALS Instrument and the Spanish Academic Vocabulary (S-AVoc) Test; to explore the dimensionality of core academic-language proficiencies, as measured by these two tests; and to examine the contribution of core academic-language proficiencies to reading comprehension. A cross-sectional sample of 810 Chilean students (grades 4-8) participated in four assessments that measured standardized reading comprehension, word-reading fluency, Spanish academic vocabulary, and S-CALS. Using classical test theory and item response theory analyses, results yielded robust reliability evidence for both instruments. Consistent with prior research, S-CALS and academic vocabulary scores displayed upward trends in higher grades yet considerable within-grade variability. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that S-CALS and S-AVoc were best conceptualized as part of a higher order construct, the Spanish core academic-language and vocabulary skills (S-CALVS). The aggregated S-CALVS scores predicted reading comprehension, beyond the contribution of grade, school factors, and word-reading fluency. This study advances our scientific understanding of CALS as relevant for adolescent literacy beyond the English language. The high-utility school-relevant language and vocabulary skills offer promising tools to inform and evaluate innovative reading comprehension interventions for Spanish-speaking adolescents.","[Meneses, Alejandra; Veronica Santelices, Maria; Figueroa, Javiera] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Uccelli, Paola] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Educ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Ruiz, Marcela; Acevedo, Daniela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile",,"Meneses, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",amenesea@uc.cl; paola_uccelli@gse.harvard.edu; vsanteli@uc.cl; maruiz@uahurtado.cl; dacevedo@uahurtado.cl; jfigueroami@uc.cl,"Ruiz, Marcela/R-3828-2019; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017; Figueroa, Javiera/H-8181-2017; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015","Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670; Figueroa, Javiera/0000-0003-1677-3932; Ruiz, Marcela/0000-0003-0260-3430; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047",David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies as part of the Harvard-Chile Innovation Initiative; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150238],"This research was supported by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies as part of the Harvard-Chile Innovation Initiative, CONICYT 2013, and FONDECYT REGULAR 1150238.

The study surveyed students in the United States (n=1,265) and Chile (n=2,076) across all discipline areas. Descriptive analysis indicated that U.S. students spent 4.94 hours on academic reading, 4.17 hours on extracurricular reading, and 16.40 hours on Facebook weekly. For Chilean students, the figures were 13.17 hours, 3.07 hours, and 14.00 hours, respectively. The results indicated that for both U.S. and Chilean participants, online reading materials were the most popular type of material, followed by magazines/newspapers, graphic novels/comic books, best-selling novels, and nonmajor academic books (books on topics outside the student's major subject in conventional print format). Due to the impact of the Internet on reading resources, students' reading patterns today are different from how they were in the past. College students' reading practices have moved to different venues with the advent of Internet technology, and the modality has migrated to online reading. Specifically, social media sites (e.g., Facebook) provide social accessibility to academic contexts that constitute students' learning experiences and shape their identities.","[Huang, Suhua] Midwestern State Univ, Reading Educ, Wichita Falls, TX 76308 USA; [Orellana, Pelusa] Univ Los Andes, Sch Educ, Res, Santiago, Chile; [Capps, Matthew] Midwestern State Univ, West Coll Educ, Wichita Falls, TX 76308 USA",,"Huang, SH (corresponding author), Midwestern State Univ, Reading Educ, Wichita Falls, TX 76308 USA.",suhua.huang@mwsu.edu; porellan@uandes.cl; matthew.capps@mwsu.edu,,"huang, suhua/0000-0001-7643-2641; , Pelusa/0000-0003-3851-8780","West Foundation in Wichita Falls, Texas; Universidad de los Andes [01/2011]","The U.S. study was supported by the West Foundation in Wichita Falls, Texas.

Results showed that motivation to read at the beginning of the school year was significantly associated with gains in reading comprehension skills. When disaggregating motivation into self-concept and value of reading, only self-concept of reading significantly predicted gains in reading comprehension.

A random-effects analysis yielded a significant mean effect of .95 overall and a significant mean effect of 1 for researcher-developed comprehension measures.

It also examined if preparation and efficacy beliefs along with teaching experience (years teaching the language arts) predicted teachers' reported writing practices. The participants were 254 grade four to six language arts teachers in urban schools in Chile. Twenty-five percent of the teachers surveyed reported they taught writing for five or more hours a week. Most teachers, however, reported devoting much less time to the teaching of writing, with 42% of teachers indicating they spent two hours or less a week teaching this skill. Another 33% of teachers reported teaching writing three to four hours a week. Teachers indicated they applied many different evidence-based practices when teaching writing, with a majority of them reporting they used 60% of the identified practices at least once a week. They also reported that they asked students to complete 19 of the 20 identified writing activities at least once a month. Teachers expressed positive beliefs about their preparation to teach writing and their efficacy to do so. Collectively, years teaching the language arts and beliefs about preparation and efficacy significantly and statistically predicted teachers' perceptions of their writing instruction. Additionally, beliefs about preparation and efficacy consistently made a unique and statistically significant positive contribution to predicting teachers' reported writing practices, whereas teaching experience made a unique and statistically negative contribution to predicting one writing practice: the reported assignment of narrative writing tasks.","[Banales, Gerardo; Ahumada, Silza; Puente, Anibal; Guajardo, Marcela; Munoz, Ignacio] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7591538, Chile; [Graham, Steve] Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",,"Graham, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",gerardo.banales@unab.cl; steve.graham@asu.edu,,"Ahumada, Silza/0000-0002-6269-4939; Guajardo, Marcela/0000-0003-0022-9254",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT) (Fondecyt) [1171898],This research was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT) (Fondecyt Regular No. 1171898).,,78,7,7,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-4777,1573-0905,,READ WRIT,Read.

However, little is known about the effect of reading comprehension performance on writing, as well as the pedagogical guidelines that can be drawn from this influence. Method Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the influence of performance in reading comprehension, distinguishing between poor and proficient readers (N = 105), who were enrolled in four eighth-grade classes between the ages of 12 and 14, on the writing of narrative and expository texts. Results Results revealed that proficient readers outperformed poor readers on objective measures of text production and informative/expository texts. Additionally, regression models demonstrated that proficient readers relied more on deeper aspects of reading and writing such as inferential skills, whereas poor readers tended to focus on superficial aspects of texts, or what Kintsch referred to as text-base, and appeared to perform better in reading and writing tasks related to narratives compared to information-based, expository texts. Conclusion These results support the theoretical perspectives of Kintsch's construction-integration model and Otero's regulation model regarding the relation between reading, writing and mental representations.","[Gutierrez de Blume, Antonio P.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Curriculum Fdn & Reading, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Soto, Christian; Rodriguez, Fernanda] Univ Concepcion, Dept Spanish, Psycholinguist Area, Concepcion, Chile; [Ramirez Carmona, Camila] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Pino Castillo, Patricio] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"de Blume, APG (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Curriculum Fdn & Reading, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",agutierrez@georgiasouthern.edu,,"Gutierrez de Blume, Antonio/0000-0001-6809-1728; Pino Castillo, Patricio Andres/0000-0002-0636-5647",[IT17I0051],Award Title `Desarrollo de una herramienta computacional para la evaluacion automatica de textos en el sistema escolar chileno' (Development of a computational tool for the automatic evaluation of texts in the Chilean school system; Award No. Fondef IT17I0051).,,51,0,0,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-0423,1467-9817,,J RES READ,J.

The main objective of this study was to examine whether profiting from written metatextual cues to launch reading strategies needs higher level of rhetorical competence than profiting from oral cues. Specifically, this study addresses two questions: (1) Is there a gap between the sensitivity to oral versus written metatextual cues depending on the student's reading skill level? (2) Do the reader's rhetorical competence, general reading comprehension, and decoding levels interact with the processing of each type of metatextual cue? Three hundred sixty-seven students (11-13 years old) summarized an expository text after reading it under one of the following four conditions: with written cues, with oral cues, with both cues combined, or with no cues. The less skilled readers who received oral or combined cues provided better summaries (they selected and organized the main ideas better) than the less skilled readers who received written cues or no cues. However, the performance of the more skilled readers was equal under the conditions with written cues, oral cues, and combined cues; these three groups outperformed the readers from the no-cues condition group. A multicategorical moderator analysis showed that following written cues demanded higher levels of general comprehension and rhetorical competence than following oral and combined cues. These data confirm that rhetorical competence is a specific capability for processing, especially written metatextual cues, and for overcoming the gap between the sensitivity to oral versus written cues.","[Sanchez, Emilio; Ricardo Garcia, J.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Dev & Educ Psychol, Salamanca, Spain; [Bustos, Andrea] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Pedag, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Garcia, JR (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Dev & Educ Psychol, Salamanca, Spain.",esanchez@usal.es; jrgarcia@usal.es; andrea.bustos@pucv.cl,"Garcia, J.

Next, we explored whether indices of meta-cognitive monitoring predicted reading performance. Finally, we examined whether poor and proficient readers exhibited distinct meta-cognitive profiles with respect to reading comprehension ability. Chilean undergraduate students (N = 146) completed a task on inconsistency detection within texts and a standardised reading comprehension performance measure, which we used, along with confidence in performance judgements, to calculate meta-cognitive monitoring accuracy. Our results confirmed that proficient readers outperformed poor readers on nearly all measures of interest, except global retrospective meta-cognitive monitoring judgements, and that proficient readers performed significantly better on items related to implicit information of texts than poor readers. Additionally, when combined in a single group, number of inconsistencies correctly detected and repaired and accurate global evaluation of learning judgements significantly predicted reading performance whereas retrospective global and local meta-cognitive monitoring judgements did not. Of special significance to our investigation, when separated in two groups, poor and proficient readers exhibited unique meta-cognitive profiles. Proficient and poor readers employ different meta-cognitive strategies, and poor readers benefit more from strategies than proficient readers.","[Soto, Christian; Bernal, Macarena Andrea Carrasco; Castro, Marco Antonio Contreras] Univ Concepcion, Dept Spanish, Psycholinguist Area, Victor Lamas 1290, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [de Blume, Antonio P.

Admission tests are being increasingly demonized in many parts of the world and many colleges and universities are dropping tests for selection purposes, claiming the tests are detrimental to fair selection. The testing industry is at the center of this criticism and is accused of maintaining, and even facilitating, the social ills associated with admissions testing, much like iconic business corporations were accused of supporting unfair labor practices in the 1990s. The response of some business corporations to those criticisms was to embrace corporate social responsibility and increase transparency and accountability in their operations. Unfortunately, such acceptance of responsibility and increased transparency have not emerged in the testing industry. We believe the legitimacy of admission tests will continue to be challenged until the testing industry adopts a new way of conducting their business to regain the goodwill of relevant stakeholders in society that so far have been largely ignored.","[Koljatic, Mladen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Silva, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile; [Sireci, Stephen G.] Ctr Educ Assessment, Amherst, MA USA",,"Koljatic, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,,"Sireci, Stephen/0000-0002-2174-8777",,,,41,14,14,9,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0731-1745,1745-3992,,EDUC MEAS-ISSUES PRA,Educ.

In this study, we examine the nature of associations between early childhood educators' literacy content knowledge and their classroom emergent literacy practices. Specifically, we apply generalized additive modeling to consider three hypotheses regarding the functional form of these associations: (1) educators' content knowledge must reach a threshold before demonstrating associations with practice, (2) educators' knowledge is associated with practice until reaching a plateau, or (3) educators' knowledge is linearly associated with practice. We measured educators' (n = 437) content knowledge using an adaptation of the Moats (1994) knowledge survey, observed their classroom practices in the fall and spring of one academic year, and applied standardized coding schemes to code the latter with respect to the quality and quantity of emergent literacy practices. In general, results indicated positive, linear associations between educators' knowledge and classroom practices. We discuss findings relative to prior work and conjectures concerning these associations as characterized by thresholds or plateaus. We also discuss implications for future research, preservice educator preparation, and inservice professional development.","[Piasta, Shayne B.; Farley, Kristin S.; Park, Somin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Piasta, Shayne B.; Farley, Kristin S.; Justice, Laura M.; Park, Somin] Ohio State Univ, Crane Ctr Early Childhood Res & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ramirez, Pamela Soto; Justice, Laura M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Educ Studies, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Farley, Kristin S.] Wittenberg Univ, Dept Educ, Springfield, OH 45501 USA; [Ramirez, Pamela Soto] Pontifica Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med, MIDE UC, Santiago, Chile",,"Piasta, SB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.; Piasta, SB (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Crane Ctr Early Childhood Res & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",piasta.1@osu.edu,,"Park, Somin/0000-0002-8885-0872",,,,76,8,8,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-4777,1573-0905,,READ WRIT,Read.

Universities offer more flexible curricula and put a lot of effort on the acquisition of professional engineering skills by the students. In many universities, the courses in the first years of different engineering degrees share program and objectives, having a large number of students and teachers. These common courses are expected to provide the students with meaningful learning experiences, which could be achieved by using active learning. The use of active learning in engineering courses improves traditional teaching by promoting students' participation and engagement, although active learning courses can be very sensitive to differences in learning paces or team conflicts; this being a challenge for the widespread adoption of active learning in courses with many students and teachers. This paper proposes a methodology that facilitates the detection and reaction to problems in active learning engineering courses with many students and teachers. This methodology is based on gathering feedback (from students and teachers) and decision-making processes at selected milestones. The methodology integrates intra-edition mechanisms in order to detect problems and react as the courses are being taught, and inter-edition mechanisms to ensure the persistence of necessary changes in the courses design. The methodology has been successfully applied during four consecutive editions to improve an undergraduate active learning programming course with an average of 257 students and 9 teachers per edition. An extended validation of expert educators suggests that this methodology can also be applied to traditional engineering courses.","[Estevez-Ayres, Iria; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Crespo-Garcia, Raquel M.; Leony, Derick; Delgado-Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Pardo, Abelardo] Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Parada G, Hugo A.] Univ Politecn Madrid, COM, Madrid 28223, Spain",,"Estevez-Ayres, I (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Ave Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.",ayres@it.uc3m.es,"PŽrez-Sanangust’n, Mar/G-8981-2015; Pardo, Abelardo/C-3001-2011; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Parada G., Hugo A./AAE-5063-2022; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Garc’a, Raquel M Crespo/F-9614-2011; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/G-4730-2011; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Parada G., Hugo A./AAE-3545-2022; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Pardo, Abelardo/0000-0002-6857-0582; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Parada G., Hugo A./0000-0003-3714-7906; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Garc’a, Raquel M Crespo/0000-0002-1014-9576; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/0000-0002-1047-5398; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Parada G., Hugo A./0000-0003-3714-7906; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness EEE project [TIN2011-28308-C03-01]; Regional Government of Madrid eMadrid project [S2009/TIC-1650]; postdoctoral fellowship Alianza 4 Universidades,"This work has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness EEE project TIN2011-28308-C03-01, the Regional Government of Madrid eMadrid project S2009/TIC-1650, and the postdoctoral fellowship Alianza 4 Universidades.",,42,16,16,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

Our main prediction was that the RAN-reading relationship would decrease due to a gradual change in reading strategy, from serial decoding to sight word reading. Therefore, in contrast to most previous studies, we used discrete reading tasks. Serial RAN tasks for objects, colors, digits, and letters were included. First, we examined whether the RAN tasks loaded on the same constructs across time. An alphanumeric and a nonalphanumeric factor were identified, which were invariant over time. In subsequent multigroup structural equation models we found that the PA-reading relationship was low but slightly increased in the higher grades. As predicted, the RAN-reading relationship decreased for words, whereas the relationship remained stable for pseudowords.","[Rodriguez, Cristina; van den Boer, Madelon; de Jong, Peter F.] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rodriguez, Cristina] Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Concepcion, Chile; [Jimenez, Juan E.] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",,"Rodriguez, C (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Fac Educ, Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.",crodri@ull.es,"JimŽnez, Juan E/AAI-6198-2021; JimŽnez, Juan E/A-6057-2008; Rodr’guez, Cristina/H-1021-2015","JimŽnez, Juan E/0000-0002-7466-8340; JimŽnez, Juan E/0000-0002-7466-8340; Rodr’guez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767","National Plan I+D+i [1FD97-1140]; FEDEREuropean Commission; Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society [GRUP2004/13]; Spanish Ministry of Education, through the National Human Resources Mobility of National I+D+i","This study was supported by grants (1FD97-1140) of the National Plan I+D+i, co-financed with FEDER, and (GRUP2004/13) of Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society of which PI was the third author.

This study aims to examine the impact of providing extra writing opportunities (i.e., writing journals) on the quality of writing compositions. A longitudinal cluster-randomized controlled design using a multilevel modeling analysis with 182 fourth grade students was conducted. We examined whether students' writing quality differed when writing journals on a weekly basis for 12 weeks, compared with a control group. Three covariates were analyzed, namely: (i) the students' attitudes towards writing; (ii) their self-efficacy in writing; (iii) and their use of self-regulation (SRL) strategies while writing. Findings have shown that students who wrote week-journals significantly improved the writing quality of their compositions and reported a higher use of SRL strategies in writing. Nevertheless, self-efficacy and attitude towards writing were found to not be related to the quality of the compositions. Moreover, data indicated that the writing quality of compositions improved along with the writing quality of the week-journals. Findings suggest the use of week-journals in class to promote writing.","[Rosario, Pedro; Hogemann, Julia; Cunha, Jennifer; Oliveira, Vera] Univ Minho, Dept Appl Psychol, Escola Psicol, P-4710052 Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunes, Jose; Vallejo, Guillermo; Rodrigues, Celestino] Univ Oviedo, Fac Psicol, Dept Psychol, Plaza Feijoo S-N, Oviedo 33003, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Educ, Calle Toesca 1783, Santiago, Chile",,"Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Appl Psychol, Escola Psicol, P-4710052 Braga, Portugal.",prosario@psi.uminho.pt,"Vallejo, Guillermo/B-8233-2011; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Ros‡rio, Pedro/A-1775-2011; Cunha, Jennifer/AAZ-7844-2020","Vallejo, Guillermo/0000-0002-8010-6854; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Ros‡rio, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Cunha, Jennifer/0000-0001-8604-2049",,,,69,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-4777,1573-0905,,READ WRIT,Read.

To this end, a sample of 5774 adolescents from 71 public schools located throughout the violent neighborhoods of Lima (Peril) was evaluated. A moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderating role of support adult figures from home and school. The results show that the support of adults at home and school mitigate the negative effect of bullying victimization on life satisfaction, and this effect is larger in the case of adult home support. Adult support at home and school help students with high prevalence of bullying victimization maintain high levels of life satisfaction compared to adolescents with low support from adults.

Participants (N = 180) were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions: mechanical reasoning with a hands-on component; mechanical reasoning without a hands-on component; an active control condition involving spatial training with cross-sectioning; and an active control group involving a reading exercise. All participants were tested immediately before, after, and one-week following training. Both mechanical conditions were associated with enhanced spatial visualization performance, an effect that was similar for both conditions and remained stable across immediate and delayed post-tests.

(b) Do these maternal practices mediate the relation between maternal education and these child outcomes? Confirming previous studies, exposure to texts and non-present talk predicted vocabulary, and teaching practices predicted child code-related skills. Contrary to previous studies, exposure to texts also predicted child code-related skills. We also found that maternal practices partially mediated the relation between maternal education and early literacy skills. Practice or Policy: Findings suggest the need to target children before prekindergarten with interventions that increase the studied maternal practices and to do so in family, day care, and health care settings with special emphasis on families with incomplete elementary education. The broad effect of exposure to texts on early literacy outcomes and the low social value on reading in Chilean culture suggest that teacher preparation programs need to include ways to engage children in literature as a frequent experience.","[Mendive, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Lissi, Maria Rosa; Reyes, Adriana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Bakeman, Roger] Georgia State Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",,"Mendive, S (corresponding author), Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",smendive@uc.cl,"Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017","Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Lissi, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-9740-6853","Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago, Chile; Harvard Graduate School of Education; Harvard Center on the Developing Child; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University; UNICEF's Chile country office; FondecytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11140637]; Chilean National Science and Technology Fund","The primary funder of this project was the Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago, Chile.

Forty mother-child dyads recorded their naturalistic exchanges in their homes using an enhanced audio-recording device (the Language ENvironment Analysis System). Results from a sample of naturalistic interactions during mealtimes indicated that all mothers involved their children in a variety of math exchanges, although there were differences in the amount of math input that children received. Moreover, being exposed to more instances of math talk was positively related to children's early mathematical ability a year after the recordings, even after we controlled for maternal education, self-regulation, and recorded minutes. Practice or Policy: These findings improve the understanding of how mothers use math with their preschool children in naturalistic contexts, providing some insight for parents into how to foster children's math skills through verbal input in their normal routines. Moreover, these findings inform kindergarten teachers and practitioners about the math input that children receive at home, which may encourage them to adapt their practice by considering the home environment.","[Susperreguy, Maria Ines] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Davis-Kean, Pamela E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Susperreguy, MI (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",misusper@uc.cl,"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015","Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Davis-Kean, Pamela/0000-0001-8389-6268",,,,54,52,53,7,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

Research Findings: The data analysis showed statistical differences in the results of students from low SES schools compared with medium and high SES schools in four symbolic number tasks: counting fluency, oral number identification, oral number comparison, and non-oral number comparison. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a direct contribution of school vulnerability index, non-symbolic number tasks, and symbolic number tasks in number comparison performance. These analyses also revealed that school vulnerability index made a loose predictive contribution when symbolic number tasks were introduced into the model. Practice or Policy: The achievement gap detected in the early stages of formal education will most likely increase with time. Early detection of mathematics learning difficulties, effective intervention, and training of teaching staff may be means of equalizing the performance of students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.","[Sepulveda, Felipe; Rodriguez, Cristina; Peake, Christian] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Sepulveda, Felipe; Peake, Christian] CIEDE UCSC, Ctr Invest Educ & Desarrollo, Concepcion, Chile; [Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ La Laguna, Fac Psicol, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",,"Sepulveda, F (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Campus San Andres,Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.",fsepulveda@ucsc.cl,"Sepślveda, Felipe/AAH-3830-2019; Sepulveda, Felipe/G-3398-2017; Rodr’guez, Cristina/H-1021-2015; Peake, Christian/F-2282-2016","Sepślveda, Felipe/0000-0001-5703-383X; Sepulveda, Felipe/0000-0001-5703-383X; Rodr’guez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767; Peake, Christian/0000-0002-7127-6501","CONICYT, FONDECYT REGULARComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1161213]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Programa Ramon y Cajal [RYC-2014-16948]","This study was supported by CONICYT, FONDECYT REGULAR 1161213; and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Programa Ramon y Cajal, RYC-2014-16948.",,79,5,5,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-9289,1556-6935,,EARLY EDUC DEV,Early Educ.

Two moderators were examined, namely, children's initial skill level and teachers' classroom organization during an interactive read-aloud session. In keeping with prior research, interactive book reading quality, measured by examination of teachers' extratextual talk, was positively and significantly related to children's development of both language and literacy skills. Interactive book reading quality was not significantly moderated by children's initial skills, with the exception that interactive book reading quality appeared most beneficial to children's print knowledge for children entering prekindergarten with relatively low skill. The unique contribution of this study is that the association between interactive book reading quality and children's expressive vocabulary was dependent on an organized classroom during the book reading session. Practice or Policy: The quality of teachers' talk during interactive book reading may matter for children's vocabulary development only when reading sessions are characterized by relatively high classroom organization. Classroom organization should be an important consideration while planning for interactive book reading sessions.","[Cabell, Sonia Q.] Florida State Univ, Sch Teacher Educ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Cabell, Sonia Q.] Florida State Univ, Florida Ctr Reading Res, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Zucker, Tricia A.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, McGovern Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [DeCoster, Jamie; Hamre, Bridget] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Ctr Adv Study Teaching & Learning, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Melo, Carolina] Univ Los Andes, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Forston, Lindsay] Communites Sch Virginia, Arlington, VA USA",,"Cabell, SQ (corresponding author), Florida Ctr Reading Res, 2010 Levy Ave, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA.",scabell@fcrr.org,"DeCoster, Jamie/ABB-7592-2021; Melo, Carolina/AAB-4282-2020","Melo-Hurtado, Carolina/0000-0003-2297-6357","U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education SciencesUS Department of Education [R305A060021]","The research reported here was supported by the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, through Grant No. R305A060021 to the University of Virginia funding the National Center for Research on Early Childhood Education, principal investigator Dr. Robert Pianta.

The first class (one 80-minute session) in an introductory computer science course may be an appropriate instance to combat such a belief. Previous studies have used coursewide interventions, e.g., games and physical/tangible devices to improve students' motivation. However, although other approaches help motivate students, they may lack real-world context or have a high cost of deployment. This article proposes a novel real-world based approach to introduce programming concepts in the first class of the introductory computer science course. This approach, called Protobject based, is applicable to courses with over 100 students, has a low deployment entry barrier, requires low investment, and may be used creatively to implement different experiences. Furthermore, the Protobject-based approach has an equivalent motivational effect-at least in the short-term-to a Game-based approach even if it is entirely focused on the real world. The low requirements of the approach make it especially suitable for an 80-minute first class in an introductory computer science course. The Protobject-based approach has been preliminarily validated and compared to a pure game-based approach with a study with 376 participants, and we present the analysis of motivation questionnaires, a pre-test and post-test, and a homework assignment given to the students. We posit that more research into initiatives such as this one-that can show students how computer science can impact the real world around them-is warranted.","[Bellino, Alessio] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat & Telecomunicac, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Herskovic, Valeria; Hund, Michael; Munoz-Gama, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Bellino, A (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat & Telecomunicac, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.",alessio.bellino@udp.cl; vherskov@ing.puc.cl; mahund@uc.cl; jmun@uc.cl,,"BELLINO, ALESSIO/0000-0003-0285-1549",CONICYT/FONDECYT (Chile)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181162]; Departamento de Ciencia de la Computacion UC/Fond [DCC 2017-0001],"This work was supported in part by: CONICYT/FONDECYT (Chile) grant 1181162, Engineering Postdoc UC 2018, and by the Departamento de Ciencia de la Computacion UC/Fond-DCC 2017-0001.",,49,0,0,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1946-6226,,,ACM T COMPUT EDUC,ACM Trans.

Chile is not an exception in this global trend. Although Chile has significantly expanded early education coverage for children from low-income backgrounds, there has been little research to assess the effects these programs have had in improving academic outcomes. Responding to this need, this study assesses the impact of Chile's public early childhood education programs on fourth-grade academic achievement (as measured by the country's national Education Quality Measurement System, SIMCE). Our results indicate that, after controlling for socio-demographic factors potentially associated with choosing to participate in an ECCE program or not, ECCE is positively associated with academic gains on all three SIMCE tests: mathematics, reading, and social sciences. Chilean children who participated in public ECCE programs scored on average 0.23 Standard Deviations (SD) higher in math, 0.19 SD higher in reading, and 0.19 SD higher in social sciences than children who did not attend an ECCE program before entering Kindergarten. However, our findings suggest that not all children benefit equally from attending ECCE. Results show that boys benefit academically significantly more than girls, and that the ECCE effect on academic achievement also differs depending on the Socioeconomic Status (SES) of the families, with children from middle-low SES groups benefiting the most.

The Mapuches comprise the main Indigenous group in Chile and a socioeconomically vulnerable group. We studied the differences in cognitive development between these two groups, focusing on the role of the families' socioeconomic resources and the parental behaviors. We use data from the 2012 Encuesta Longitudinal de Primera Infancia, a nationally representative survey of early childhood (0-6 years old) in Chile, which includes a test of cognitive development validated for Mapuche preschoolers. Our results indicate that the cognitive gap between Mapuche children and non Indigenous children in Chile starts before they enter primary school (SD = 0.2, p < 0.001), which coincides with the lower limit of the gap found in previous studies during school years. In linear models of cognitive development, socioeconomic resources, and parental behaviors account for part of the gap between Mapuche children and non-Indigenous children, but not for all of it. We also find a positive interaction between a Mapuche origin and home learning materials, which indicates that Mapuche children benefit from a rich learning environment at home more intensively than do non-Indigenous Chilean children.

Anatomy laboratories have been replacing formaldehyde with solutions that retain the characteristics of fresh tissue. For this purpose, alternative solutions with a very low concentration of formaldehyde or without any formaldehyde have been analyzed. The objective of this study was to compare biometry, coloration, haptic properties, and bacterial load on animal specimens (pig kidneys) embalmed with formaldehyde, and with Chilean Conservative Fixative Solution with and without formaldehyde (formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS). Also, the perception of health and biological science students toward specimens treated with different solutions was assessed. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in specimens' retraction, or bacterial load. Students showed a preference for organs embalmed in formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS; indicating that with these treatments they could better visualize structures and that the prosections had greater flexibility and the colors were more similar to those of fresh tissue. Additionally, students recommended the material embalmed in formaldehyde chCFS and formaldehyde-free chCFS for anatomy learning. In contrast, students indicated that formaldehyde-fixation negatively affected their practical experience. In conclusion, embalming with formaldehyde chCFS or formaldehyde-free chCFS provides an advantageous practical experience over the use of formaldehyde and may be an alternative to replace the use of formaldehyde in anatomy laboratories.","[Skopnik-Chicago, Marianne; Poblete-Cordero, Katherine; Lizana, Pablo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Morphol Sci, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Zamora, Natali; Bastias, Roberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Microbiol, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Lizana, PA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Morphol Sci, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",pablo.lizana@pucv.cl,"Bast’as, Roberto/AAW-7522-2021","Bast’as, Roberto/0000-0003-4819-6148; Lizana, Pablo A./0000-0002-9366-6930",,,,72,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1935-9772,1935-9780,,ANAT SCI EDUC,Anat.

In the case of parenting, maternal reflective function unfolds within child-caregiver interactions, and previous studies have pointed out this variable as necessary for positive care. In the present study we sought to understand how high levels of stress could interfere with their reflective function capacity, and how this relates to children's ToM. A sample of 125 mothers and their preschool children (36-54 months) was assessed. It was hypothesized that the maternal reflective function would play a mediating role between the parental stress variable and the preschooler's ToM. The study found that parental stress exerted direct and significant effects on the mother's reflective function and direct but mild effects on the child's ToM. In addition, different elements of parental stress would act differently on the mother's reflective function.","[Cowes, Ely Ann; Santelices, Maria Pia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Santelices, MP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Sch Psychol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130786]; Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) through the Millennium Institute for Research on Depression and Personality-MIDAP [IS130005]","This paper was prepared with support from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, FONDECYT [grant number 1130786], and Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) through the Millennium Institute for Research on Depression and Personality-MIDAP [grant number IS130005].",,37,0,0,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0300-4430,1476-8275,,EARLY CHILD DEV CARE,Early Child Dev.

Nevertheless, the transactional model of development (Sameroff, 2010) suggests that the relationship might run the other way as well. This research examined how children's reading interest (as reported by their parents) and parents' literacy practices remain stable or change over time, as well as cross-lagged relationships between reading interest and parents' literacy practices from the beginning of prekindergarten to the end of kindergarten. The 721 participants were drawn from low-SES Chilean families participating in a larger study. The results show that in these low-income Chilean families, it is more likely for reading interest to predict parents' practices than the other way around. Results suggest that interventions designed to improve the home literacy environment could be attained through improving parents' perceptions of children's reading interest rather than seeking only to change parents' practices directly.

Many students who attended vocational high schools experienced high levels of discomfort with their academic preparedness to face postsecondary education. Other initial problems were adapting socially to a new environment and perceiving themselves as less gifted than their peers. However, after these initial adjustment problems, students revealed high perseverance to face difficulties and a strong motivation for continuing the academic path they had outlined for themselves.

Empirical support has been provided for both positions. This paper provides data from a study performed with 50 Spanish-speaking gifted children and adolescents using a comparison group of 50 average-ability peers matched by sex and chronological age. The results show no significant differences between gifted students and their peers on global measures of adjustment. Instead, they suggest that gifted students are neither significantly more poorly nor better adjusted than their peers during different age periods.

The sample consisted of 268 children, 144 in the intervention group and 124 in the comparison group. The computer-based intervention comprised 16 sessions of 30min each. Children in the intervention group demonstrated significantly more progress in WM than those in the comparison group when we evaluated them 3 months after exposure to the program and controlled for initial differences with an analysis of covariance. ELS were significantly stronger in children who were exposed to the stimulation program, which supports a link between WM and ELS.

Participants were 390 Chilean preschool children and their parents. Children completed numeracy and literacy tasks at the beginning of preschool (mean age: 4 years and 7 months) and approximately 8 months later. Parents reported on the home numeracy activities they engaged in with their children, including formal (i.e., mapping and operational), informal (i.e., parents' number-game knowledge), and home literacy activities (i.e., code-related and meaning-related), as well as on numeracy and literacy attitudes and expectations for children's performance prior to Grade 1. We found that parents with more positive numeracy attitudes and higher academic expectations reported a higher frequency of formal numeracy (mapping and operational) activities. In turn, formal operational activities predicted number line estimation and applied problem-solving skills. In contrast, informal activities (i.e., parents' numbergame knowledge) predicted children's non-symbolic arithmetic and non-symbolic number comparison tasks, as well as their applied problem-solving skills. The links between home activities and numeracy outcomes were domain specific: Parents' reports of literacy activities did not predict early numeracy skills. We discuss how our results support the enhanced Home Numeracy Model and thus provide a more complete framework connecting parents' engagement in numeracy activities and children's mathematical outcomes.

HOTT is less frequent in lower-income children and children with brain injuries, but effects differed depending on HOTT complexity and type of brain injury. Controlling for income, children with larger and later-occurring cerebrovascular infarcts produce fewer surface (where relations are more perceptual) and structure (where relations are more abstract) HOTT utterances than TD children. In contrast, children with smaller and earlier occurring periventricular lesions produce HOTT at comparable rates to TD children. This suggests that examining HOTT development may be an important tool for understanding the impacts of brain injury in children.

Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the unique contributions of these components to distinctive early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool children. Moreover, most studies have not considered the covariance between these early academic skills in preschool-aged children. The present study examined whether there are differential contributions of visual-spatial and verbal short-term memory, working memory, and response inhibition to specific early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool-aged children, taking into account the covariance among these outcomes. Several seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analyses were conducted with 419 Chilean preschool aged children (M = 53.9 months; SD = 4.22). The results show that both response inhibition and verbal short-term memory uniquely predicted all academic outcomes; working memory predicted all early academic skills (with the exception of verbal counting); and visual-spatial short-term memory predicted all numeracy skills and receptive vocabulary. When comparing the marginal effects of the EFs on the outcomes, response inhibition more strongly predicted applied problems than did working memory. Both visual-spatial short-term memory and response inhibition had a greater effect on explaining applied problems, compared to early decoding skills. Implications for teachers and interventions are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have examined various dimensions of the preschool classroom language environment, including linguistic responsivity of early childhood educators, data-providing features of teachers' talk, and characteristics of the systems-level general environment, but no study has examined the unique contribution of each dimension to children's language growth over time. The goals of this study were to determine how best to represent the dimensionality of the preschool classroom's linguistic environment and to determine which dimensions are most strongly associated with children's language development. Participants were teachers in 49 preschool classrooms and a random sample of children from each classroom (330 children between 40 and 60 months of age, M = 52 months, SD = 5.5). Children's grammar and vocabulary skills were measured at three time-points, and the classroom linguistic environment was assessed with measures representing teachers' linguistic responsivity, data-providing features of teachers' talk, and systems-level general quality. Using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), we determined that the classroom language environment is best characterized by a three-dimensional model. A multilevel latent growth model subsequently showed that only one of the three dimensions, teachers' communication-facilitating behaviors, predicted growth in children's vocabulary from preschool to kindergarten.

This study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, maternal self-competence, parental cognitive stimulation, and maternal supportive discipline as predictors of five-year-old preschoolers' school readiness and executive function abilities in 70 families of low-SES homes with a Chilean majority or indigenous Mapuche minority background in Chile. Additionally, the mediating role of parental beliefs and parenting practices between SES and school readiness or executive functioning respectively was investigated as suggested by the Family Stress Model. Results show that maternal supportive discipline predicted school readiness above and beyond SES and ethnicity. Furthermore, maternal supportive discipline mediated the relation between SES and school readiness, whereby higher SES positively affected maternal supportive discipline, which in turn had a favorable effect on school readiness. All other associations were non-significant. The outcomes highlight that parental involvement of culturally diverse families from low-SES backgrounds is important for children's cognitive development. School readiness of Chilean preschoolers from low-SES homes might possibly be improved by enhancing maternal sensitivity and positive behavioral control strategies. These parenting skills have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of low-SES environments to some extent.

Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students' learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students' performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.","[Marin, B.; Frez, J.] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Cruz-Lemus, J.; Genero, M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Paseo Univ 4, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",,"Marin, B (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Informat, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.",beatriz.marin@mail.udp.cl; jonathan.frez@mail.udp.cl; JoseAntonio.Cruz@uclm.es; Marcela.Genero@uclm.es,"Mar’n, Beatriz/Z-5032-2019; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./B-7299-2015","Mar’n, Beatriz/0000-0001-8025-0023; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./0000-0002-0470-609X","CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [REDI170020]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R]; Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM","This work has been developed within the ENSE Project (REDI170020) funded by CONICYT, the SEQUOIA Project, (TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R) (MINECO/FEDER) funded by Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, and the GEMA project funded by Consejeria de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes de la Direccion General de Universidades, Investigacion e Innovacion de la JCCM.",,45,21,21,6,39,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1946-6226,,,ACM T COMPUT EDUC,ACM Trans.

Past studies have indicated that even if teachers show interest in cognitive neuroscience, they show high rates of adhesion to neuromyths. In the most commonly used questionnaire, however, respondents do not compare neuromyths and correct information based on neuroscience. The present study proposes a multiple-choice questionnaire that presents scenarios occurring in school. The most commonly used and the new questionnaire were administered to 174 Italian teachers. In the most commonly used questionnaire, teachers generally had the same likelihood of accepting neuromyths as the literature reports. In the new questionnaire, the levels of both general knowledge and beliefs about neuromyths were significantly lower. Moreover, it suggests that teachers' adhesion to neuromyths in realistic situations does not match their explicit beliefs. Thus, the present research proposes that the use of questions based on feasible scenarios is a useful method to assess neuromyths.","[Tovazzi, Alice] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Dorsoduro 3434-D, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Giovannini, Serena; Basso, Demis] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Educ, Cognit & Educ Sci Lab CESLab, Viale Ratisbona 16, Bressanone Brixen, Italy; [Basso, Demis] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Neuropsicol & Neurociencias Cognit, Talca, Chile",,"Tovazzi, A (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Philosophy & Cultural Heritage, Dorsoduro 3434-D, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",alice.tovazzi@unive.it,"Basso, Demis/Q-4782-2017","Basso, Demis/0000-0002-4595-3513",,,,35,5,5,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-2271,1751-228X,,MIND BRAIN EDUC,Mind Brain Educ.,MAY,2020,14,2,,,SI,,187,198,,10.1111/mbe.12249,,,12,"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Developmental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; Psychology,LY8YO,WOS:000540815600012,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,mind brain and education,Q3

The elements that mostly affect that perception are the curricular contents, teaching methodologies, and the handling of the education atmosphere. These elements, complex and dynamic, are perceived differently according to the level of the career. Some studies establish that the perception improves as the student progresses in the career, while others show the opposite. Objectives: Measure the perception of nursing students of the education atmosphere and compare the differences among the distinct levels of the career. Design: This was a longitudinal prospective study. Settings and Participants The study was conducted with nursing students from the class of 2011 at Universidad de los Andes, Santiago-Chile. Sixty-one students complied with inclusion criteria and were surveyed in second (n = 55), third (n = 51), and fourth (n = 34) years, during 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Methods: The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure questionnaire was applied. The STATA 10 program was used for analysis and the one way ANOVA was use to compare the results. Results: The average perception of the education atmosphere was 133/200, obtaining more positive aspects than negative ones. Students improve their perception as they advance in the career. The three measurements repeat five items as weaknesses and 12 as strengths. Conclusions: It is convenient to bear in mind the difficulties of students to reconcile the clinical experiences with the theoretical classes on campus by continuous assessing the academic load and the demands made by each professor. Some strategies would include promoting professors' greater closeness with the students, considering travel times in the academic programming, as well as applying the basic theoretical contents in real clinical cases to give them relevance.

Methods: Students in the sample are stratified by performance, with the experimental group (49 students) being exposed to self-instruction and clinical simulation on the topic of standard precautions and special precautions according to disease transmission mechanisms. Conventional classes on the same topics were provided to the control group (49 students). Results: The experimental group showed the best performance in the multiple-choice post-test of knowledge (p = 0.002) and in the assessment of essay questions (p = 0.043), as well as in the evaluation of a simulated scenario, in relation to the control group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is possible to transfer some teaching subjects on the prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) to self-learning by means of virtual teaching strategies with good results. This allows greater efficiency in the allocation of teachers to clinical simulation or learning situations in the laboratory, where students can apply what they have learned in the self-instruction module.","[Kappes Ramirez, Maria Soledad] San Sebastian Univ, Sch Nursing, Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5501842, Chile",,"Ramirez, MSK (corresponding author), San Sebastian Univ, Sch Nursing, Lago Panguipulli 1390, Puerto Montt 5501842, Chile.",maria.kappes@uss.cl,"Kappes, Maria/AAC-6029-2020","Kappes, Maria/0000-0001-8101-3898",,,,33,3,4,1,13,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

Nursing students may commit errors during clinical practice, compromising patient safety. Objective: Analyze the adverse events, as well as the factors associated with the errors, reported by students from a private university in Santiago, Chile during nursing clinical rotations. Methods: Quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study. A total of 68 errors by first- through fifth-year nursing students were reported between 2012 and 2018. The data collection instrument was the Adverse Events Notification Form from the School of Nursing. This form documented information about the study as well as about the event. Results: After this reporting system was established in 2012, the number of events reported increased steadily each year. The greatest numbers of reported errors were committed by fifth-year students (73.5%), and the most common type of error was associated with medication administration (94.2%), including incorrect dose (27.9%) and incorrect medication (17.6%). The major factors contributing to errors were failure to review the 10 rights of medication administration (85.3%) or lack of critical judgment (7.4%). Most of the errors occurred in public institutions (72.1%). Conclusion: The results suggest that it would be beneficial to re-evaluate how safety and quality of care are taught at the school of nursing, with an emphasis on understanding the learning styles of students and teaching strategies of instructors. It Is crucial that the academic institution remain actively involved in teaching safety-related skills to future nursing professionals. Furthermore, we suggest modifications to the adverse events reporting system that would avoid the need for personal interpretations of the event by the student.","[Echeverria Bickel, Araceli; Ximena Villasecas, Vargas; Javiera Fluxa, Parro] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile",,"Bickel, AE (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile.",aracelie@uandes.cl; xivargasv@uandes.cl; jfparro@uandes.cl,,,,,,24,4,4,6,18,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

Most MBDs are categorized as disorders of primary hemostasis (ie, type 1 VWD and platelet function disorders), but mild or moderate deficiencies of clotting factors and some rare hyperfibrinolytic disorders are also included. These patients have abnormal bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes, menorrhagia, and disproportionate hemorrhages after trauma, invasive procedures, and surgery. This review addresses the main problems that physicians and hemostasis laboratories confront with the diagnosis of these patients, including: discerning normal/appropriate from pathological bleeding, the role and yield of screening tests, the lack of distinctive bleeding pattern among the different diseases, the inherent difficulties in the diagnosis of type 1 VWD and the most common platelet functional disorders, improvements in assays to measure platelet aggregation and secretion, and the evidence that most of the patients with MBDs end up without a definite diagnosis after exhaustive and repeated laboratory testing. Much research is needed to determine the pathogenesis of bleeding in MBD patients. Better standardization of current laboratory assays, progress in the knowledge of fibrinolytic mechanisms and their laboratory evaluation, and new understanding of the factors contributing to platelet-vessel wall interaction, along with the corresponding development of laboratory tools, should improve our capacity to diagnose a greater proportion of patients with MBDs.","[Quiroga, Teresa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Clin Labs, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Mezzano, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Hematol Oncol, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Quiroga, T (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Dept Clin Labs, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4686, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",tquiroga@med.puc.cl,,,,,,62,49,49,0,7,AMER SOC HEMATOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"2021 L ST NW, SUITE 900, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-4391,1520-4383,,HEMATOL-AM SOC HEMAT,Hematol.-Am.

It transcends the traditional bio-medical perspective in health through a bio-psycho-social and spiritual approach. Holistic point of view in palliative care is essential, and needs to be consistently hi-lighted to nursing students to improve end of life care. Objective: To describe nursing students? experience in a palliative care unit in Santiago, Chile. Design: A qualitative phenomenological study utilising purposive sampling of 10 nursing students from a Chilean university was undertaken, who completed their final year in a palliative care unit between 2017 and 2019. Methods: Data were collected using in-depth interviews, which were conducted, recorded, transcribed and analysed according to Streubert-Carpenter method. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad de los Andes, Chile. Results: Three main themes were identified in the data with their consequent units of meaning; these were experiences from all participants. The first theme identified was the diverse learning experiences students had. Topics included were: spirituality, dignity, teamworking and communication with the patient and family. They also identified personal growth. The second theme was living through the experience of difficult times; this included how they dealt facing death and how they found meaning on this. Also, patient loneliness, abandonment and the impact of shortage of human and material resources. The final theme was recognising that touching patients is often the essence of nursing and is paramount in palliative care. Conclusions: Completing a placement in a palliative care unit contributes to student nurses? personal and professional development. It provides multiple tools related to the care of terminally-ill patients and their families. It is recommended to undergraduate nurses have the opportunity to experience palliative care throughout curriculum and that they learn to embed theory to practice.","[Farfan-Zuniga, Ximena; Jaman-Mewes, Paula] Univ los Andes, Fac Enfermeria & Obstet, Santiago, Chile",,"Farfan-Zuniga, X (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Enfermeria & Obstet, Santiago, Chile.",xfarfan@uandes.cl; pjaman@uandes.cl,,,,,,23,0,0,3,9,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

The inclusion of the nature of science and scientific inquiry, the connection with aspects of daily life, work based on scientific argumentation, and the use of empirical studies from current research have been identified as important aspects to include in teaching evolution. In this work, we present a series of three activities, which were developed after considering all the recommendations of the literature described above. The sequence begins with the example of the evolution of one of the species most loved by students: dogs. Through argumentation, students make their preconceptions explicit. After this, a long-term experiment about artificial selection in the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) is presented (see Glaze, 2018) as part of the reflection on the experimental evidence that supports evolution. Finally, students are asked to generate a hypothesis about how they think the domestication process of wolves occurred, eventually resulting in dogs. The outcomes of implementation in high school classrooms and biology teacher education are discussed.","[Nunez, Paola] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Biol Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Castillo, Pablo] San Ignacio Ssalle Sch, Sci Dept, Valparaiso, Chile; [Hinojosa, Claudia] Manuel de Salas Sch, Biol Dept, Rancagua, Chile; [Parraguez, Carolina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sci Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sci Educ, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Nunez, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Biol Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.",paola.nunez@pucv.cl; pcastillo@colsis.cl; claudia.hinojosa@lms.cl; carolinapaaz.97@gmail.com; hernan.cofre@pucv.cl,,,Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1181801],"This material is based on work supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT), grant #1181801 to HC.",,27,0,0,1,1,NATL ASSOC BIOLOGY TEACHERS INC,RESTON,"12030 SUNRISE VALLEY DR, #110, RESTON, VA 20191 USA",0002-7685,1938-4211,,AM BIOL TEACH,Am.

In motor skill acquisition, expertise is defined by automaticity. The highest level of performance with less cognitive and attentional resources characterizes this stage, allowing experts to perform multiple tasks. Conventional validated parameters as operative time, objective assessment skills scales (OSATS), and movement economy, are insufficient to distinguish if an individual has reached the more advanced learning phases, such as automaticity. There is literature about using a VSST as an attention indicator that correlates with the automaticity level. METHODS: Novices with completed and approved Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery course, and laparoscopy experts were enrolled for an experimental study and measured under dual tasks conditions. Each participant performed the test giving priority to the primary task while at the same time they responded to a VSST. The primary task consisted of 4 interrupted laparoscopic stitches (ILS) on a bench-model. The VSST was a screen that showed different patterns that the surgeon had to recognize and press a pedal while doing the stitches (PsychoPsy software, Python, MacOS). Novices were overtrained on ILS until they reach at least 100 repetitions and then were retested. Participants were video recorded and then assessed by 2 blinded evaluators who measured operative time and OSATS. These scores were considered indicators of quality for the primary task. The VSST performance was measured by the detectability index (DI), which is a ratio between correct and wrong detections. A reliable evaluation was defined as two measures of DI with less than 10% of difference, maintaining the cutoff scores for performance on the primary task (operative time <110 seg and OSATS > 17 points). RESULTS: Novices (n = 11) achieved reliable measure of the test after 2 (2-5) repetitions on the preassessment and 3.75 (2-5) on the postassessment (p = 0.04); whereas laparoscopy experts (n = 4) did it after 3.5 (3-4) repetitions. Proficiency cutoff scores for the primary task were achieved on every measure for novices (prepost over-training) and experts. Expert performance on VSST was DI 0.78 (0.69-0.87). Novice performance was significantly better on postassessment (DI-pre 0.48 [0.06-0.71] vs DI-post 0.78 [0.48-0.95], p = 0.003). Overtraining consisted in 140 (100-210) repetitions of ILS for all novices, made in 8 hours (3-15). By categorizing DI based on expert performance, novices with DI-post > 0.65 achieved better OSATS score and less operative time than novices with DI-post < 0.65 (p = 0.007 y, p = 0.089, respectively). CONCLUSION: Measuring automaticity is feasible using a VSST. This instrument is reliable and has a face, content and construct validity. A DI over 0.65 may be a cutoff point correlated with high standard performance on the primary task. This instrument measures performance on laparoscopic skills,. and along with conventional indicators, would better define advance levels of expertise. More studies are required applying this VSST to achieve external validity by reproducing our results. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, although bullying often can be discriminatory (e.g., homophobic), there remains limited attention to how issues of diversity relate to students reporting their victimization experiences. Among 572 students in four Chilean high schools, we tested a model in which multiple factors predicted students' consistency of reporting victimization. Students who perceived having a sexual orientation/gender identity-specific antibullying policy reported less frequently hearing teachers or staff make homophobic comments, and students who perceived having a general antibullying policy reported that teachers and staff more frequently intervened against homophobic behavior. In turn, hearing teachers and staff make fewer homophobic comments and seeing them more frequently correct homophobic behavior related to students reporting stronger trust in their teachers and staff. Finally, stronger trust in teachers and staff was associated with more consistently reporting victimization experiences.","[Berger, Christian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Paul Poteat, V.] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ, Boston, MA USA; [Dantas, Julio] Todo Mejora, Santiago, Chile",,"Berger, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",cberger@uc.cl,,"Berger, Christian/0000-0003-1909-7490",OREALC/UNESCO Santiago [4500278883]; Todo Mejora,"This study was funded by OREALC/UNESCO Santiago (Partners Agreement 4500278883), and sponsored by Todo Mejora.",,52,8,8,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1538-8220,1538-8239,,J SCH VIOLENCE,J.

Elementary teachers indicated that they would provide more classroom-based emotional/behavioral supports and specialty supports than middle and high school teachers; however, high school teachers more often indicated that they would reduce expectations and provide a referral for students. Implications and future research directions for work with teachers on identifying and supporting students are discussed.","[Green, Jennifer Greif; Guzman, Javier; Harbaugh, Allen G.; Segal, Noah; LaBillois, James] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Guzman, Javier] Univ Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; [Didaskalou, Eleni] Univ Thessaly, Volos, Greece",,"Green, JG (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Educ, 2 Silber Way, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jggreen@bu.edu,"Guzman, Javier/E-8170-2016","Guzman, Javier/0000-0002-8194-039X; Green, Jennifer/0000-0002-3541-4989",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K01MH085710],"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was supported by Grant K01MH085710 (Green) from the National Institute of Mental Health.",,77,9,9,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1063-4266,1538-4799,,J EMOT BEHAV DISORD,J.

Self-determination involves skills to help make things they want happen in their own lives. In people with intellectual disabilities over 45, self-advocacy and self-awareness skills could be strengthened. Age, place of residence and support received by people with intellectual disabilities over 45, are some of the things that influence their self-determination. Background Self-determination is a key construct to guarantee the development of skills that allow people with disabilities to acquire control over their lives. However, people with intellectual disabilities may have premature ageing processes that make it difficult to exercise these skills. This study seeks to determine the self-determination levels of 516 ageing adults with intellectual disabilities between the ages of 45 and 86 years. Method The data were collected with an ad hoc scale developed from the Functional Model of Self-Determination. Findings The results show that competencies related to self-advocacy and self-knowledge greatly decreased, unlike making choices and solving problems. In addition, the severity of the disability, age, place of residence and type of support are identified as variables associated with levels of self-determination. Conclusions There is a need to prioritise the acquisition and maintenance of skills related to self-realisation as the basis for intervention proposals in self-determination.","[Alvarez-Aguado, Izaskun] Univ Las Amer, Fac Salud & Ciencias Sociales, Sede Providencia, Manuel Montt 948, Santiago, Chile; [Vega Cordova, Vanessa; Spencer Gonzalez, Herbert; Gonzalez Carrasco, Felix; Jarpa Azagra, Marcela; Exss Cid, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Alvarez-Aguado, I (corresponding author), Univ Las Amer, Fac Salud & Ciencias Sociales, Sede Providencia, Manuel Montt 948, Santiago, Chile.",ialvareza@udla.cl,,"Alvarez-Aguado, Izaskun/0000-0002-8021-525X",ANID FONDECYT DE POSTDOCTORADO [3190675],ANID FONDECYT DE POSTDOCTORADO No 3190675,,52,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-4187,1468-3156,,BRIT J LEARN DISABIL,Brit.

The objective was threefold: 1) to develop multidisciplinary skills, 2) to introduce students to professional-style projects and 3) to integrate knowledge from core courses. In order to develop a wider awareness about how they are seen in their environment, an automated peer assessment system focused in feedback was applied. Ahundred students of both disciplines took part in this activity over 6 weeks. The activity was generally well received by students. Mutual dependence from peer's work raised awareness about the importance of responsibility, while leadership was perceived through a different perspective. Skills such as conflict resolution, planning and enthusiasm were identified as key issues to boost teamwork. In conclusion, the professional-like environment allowed students to see how their future activity will be, while access to technology and industrial environments were important drivers to motivate them.

Conversely, a phenomenon described by classical physics should contain no explicit reference to (h) over bar. However, the problem of a particle encountering a discontinuous potential step, which is one of the simplest examples in quantum mechanics, contradicts this common thought: even when the particle carries enough kinetic energy to go across the step, the resulting expression for the reflection probability is nonzero-a purely quantum phenomenon-and yet it contains no reference to (h) over bar. We show that the absence of (h) over bar in this purely quantum expression is due to the idealised limit in which the potential rises sharply at a single position, thus losing any reference to a length dimension in the problem. To address the correct classical limit of the phenomenon we first regularise the discontinuity in the potential by taking a continuous linearly rising function over a distance a. We show that the correct classical limit, which is when no reflection occurs, is obtained for large values of a, not for vanishing a. The latter actually corresponds to a purely quantum case, albeit in a limiting case of a discontinuously abrupt change in the potential at a single point in space.","[Dib, Claudio O.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Ctr Cient & Tecnol Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Dib, Claudio O.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Valparaiso, Chile; [Orellana, Oscar] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Math, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Dib, CO (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Ctr Cient & Tecnol Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.; Dib, CO (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Phys, Valparaiso, Chile.",claudio.dib@usm.cl; oscar.orellana@usm.cl,,,"Fondecyt, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130617, 1141260]; Conicyt, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [ACT1406, FB0821]","This work was supported in part by Fondecyt grants 1130617 and 1141260, and Conicyt grants ACT1406 and FB0821, Chile.",,15,1,1,0,9,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,1361-6404,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

A pedagogical glance at the origin of mass,european journal of physics,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PLASMA; FIELD,"Among the most startling experiences a student encounters is learning that, unlike electrons and other elementary particles, photons have no mass. Under certain circumstances, however, the light quantum behaves as if it did have a finite mass. Starting from Maxwell's equations, we discuss how this arises when light interacts with a charged plasma, or travels along a waveguide. The motion of such photons is analysed using kinematic concepts of special relativity, and we show how a cutoff frequency for effective propagation appears. Seeing how an environment may yield an apparent dynamic mass to the photon paves the way for later understanding: might the Higgs boson field provide other particles, such as the electron, with a mass? This paper is addressed to mid-level physics students, teachers and lecturers, requiring only a knowledge of classical electromagnetic and special relativity theories.","[Robles, P.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Elect, Valparaiso, Chile; [Claro, F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 22, Chile",,"Robles, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Elect, Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.",probles@ucv.cl; fclaro@uc.cl,,"claro, francisco/0000-0003-2122-6992","Escuela de Ingenieria Electrica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso","We are grateful to Dr P Gaete of the Physics Department, Universidad Santa Maria, for helpful discussions and a critical reading of this manuscript.

They consider the reflected and not the transmitted light for two instead of the four types of thin films. In this work, we complement the discussion in elementary textbooks, by analysing the phase differences required to match the conditions for constructive and destructive interference, in the reflected and transmitted light in four types of thin films. We consider thin films with varied sequences in the refractive index, which we identify as barriers, wells and stairs (up and down). Also, we use the conservation of energy in order to understand the complementary colour fringes observed in the reflected and transmitted light through thin films. We analyse systematically the phase changes by introducing a phase table and we synthesize the results in a circular diagram matching 16 physical situations of interference and their corresponding conditions on the film thickness. The phase table and the circular diagram are a pair of tools easily assimilated by students, and useful to organize, analyse and activate the knowledge about thin films.","[Rojas, Roberto; Fuster, Gonzalo; Sluesarenko, Viktor] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Fis, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Rojas, R (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Fis, Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.",roberto.rojas@usm.cl,,,"Direccion General de Investigacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria [11.08.56, 11.09.71]","We want to thank to the Direccion General de Investigacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria for grants 11.08.56 and 11.09.71.

To illustrate this, is modeled mechanically a triatomic molecule using the Lagrangian formulation and assuming a type of molecule in which the masses (atoms) are located at the vertices of a triangle. For an analytical treatment of the problem we use the theory of small oscillations, considering equal masses (atoms) and coupling constants. This allows to write the Lagrangian, and then to obtain dynamical equations for determining normal vibration frequencies. The case of the linear triatomic molecule is analyzed and discussed, determining the corresponding vibrational normal modes. Finally, the solutions for both cases are compared.","[Lavin, Roberto; Pozo, Julio] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Basicas, Santiago, Chile",,"Lavin, R (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Basicas, Santiago, Chile.",julio.pozo@udp.cl,,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,SOC BRASILEIRA FISICA,SAO PAULO,"CAIXA POSTAL 66328, 05315-970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",1806-1117,,,REV BRAS ENSINO FIS,Rev.

Stress-strain curves are found for these elements. Compression in elastic bands is practically impossible to achieve due to flaccidity. A typical experiment for the complete loading-unloading cycle is to subject a tubular object to torsion. This paper suggests simple experiments for studying properties concerning elasticity and plasticity in elements of common use, subjected to stretching or compression, and also torsion reinforcing. The experiments use plastic binders, rubber bands and metal springs under a moderate load. This paper discusses an experiment with an original device to measure torsion deformations as a function of applied torques, which permitted construction of the hysteresis cycle for a rubber hose and various tubes. Another experiment was designed to define the temporal recovery of a plastic spring with initial stretching. A simple mathematical model was developed to explain this phenomenon.","Catholic Univ Maule, Basic Sci Fac, Talca, Chile",,"Romo-Kroger, CM (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Maule, Basic Sci Fac, Casilla 617, Talca, Chile.",cromo@ucm.cl,,"Romo Kroger, Carlos Manuel/0000-0002-1306-5423",,,,16,2,2,1,13,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

A list of abilities and knowledge attributes were derived from similar studies and the expectations expressed by professional organizations. Input was received from managers of 75 different companies across a broad range of industries and sizes and 116 engineering graduates regarding the importance and preparation for 57 abilities and knowledge attributes in 10 categories. Each competency was given a priority based on one of three criteria: 50% or more of managers reporting it to be of the highest level of importance, an average rating greater than a cutoff, and a weighted measure of priority incorporating the importance and gap between graduate preparation and needs. The results suggest that, to managers in Chile, the most important non-technical competencies are in the areas of project control, ethics, communications, teamwork, innovation and budgeting. The competencies identified as important were similar to those seen in studies in other countries, but with a greater emphasis on ethics and innovation and less emphasis on quality and customer focus. A method for prioritizing the important competencies was also presented. Many initiatives were proposed to improve specific non-technical competencies that graduates need for competing in the Chilean job market.

Two key aspects of this experiment that make possible a successful measurement of the content of oxygen in the air are the use of a closed atmosphere and the use of a chemical reaction that involves the oxidation of a solid element into a solid oxide. The oxygen for the chemical reaction is provided by the closed volume of air, whose volume changes are easy to measure. In previous versions of the steel wool experiment, several days were needed to complete it; however, the experiment can be completed in about 30 min by cleaning the steel wool using acetone and then washing it in acetic acid or vinegar. A new simple closed-volume experiment to measure the oxygen content in the air is described that can be completed in a few minutes. In this experiment, steel wool is placed inside a glass tube that is connected with two normal glass syringes. The tube is then heated by a flame and the air in the syringes is forced, by moving the syringes plungers, to pass through the heated steel wool. This experiment is an excellent classroom illustration of the 21% of O(2) in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a complement to the steel wool-acetic acid experiment.","[Vera, Francisco; Rivera, Rodrigo; Nunez, Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Rivera, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",rodrigo.rivera@ucv.cl,"Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/M-4058-2017","Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/0000-0001-8506-2494; Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390",FON-DEF [TE10I012]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; DGIP-PUCV,"We would like to acknowledge financial support from FON-DEF Project TE10I012, FONDECYT Project 1110713 and from DGIP-PUCV.",,5,4,4,0,28,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-9584,,,J CHEM EDUC,J.

This classic demonstration is used in introductory physics courses to show that after eliminating the friction force with the air, the piece of paper falls with acceleration g. To test if the paper falls behind the book in a nearly free fall motion or if it is dragged by the book, we designed a version of this experiment that includes a ball and a piece of paper over a book that is forced to fall using elastic cords. We recorded a video of our experiment using a high-speed video camera at 300 frames per second that shows that the book and the paper fall faster than the ball, which falls well behind the book with an acceleration approximately equal to g. Our experiment shows that the piece of paper is dragged behind the book and therefore the paper and book demonstration should not be used to show that all objects fall with acceleration g independently of their mass.","[Vera, F.; Rivera, R.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Vera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",fvera@ucv.cl,,"Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390",FONDEF ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [TE10I012]; FONDECYT ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; DGIP-PUCV,"We would like to acknowledge financial support from FONDEF Project TE10I012, FONDECYT Project 1110713 and from DGIP-PUCV.",,21,6,6,1,14,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

In this strategy, students communicate face-to-face through a social network while supporting their work with handhelds interconnected through a wireless network. Information transfers from the social network to the handheld network and vice versa, meaning that collaborators maintain face-to-face interaction at all times while also being able to obtain and retrieve information.

A possible workaround is using cloud server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling, molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly described. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, a pool of students positively evaluated these tutorials in terms of the time required for their completion, their ability to understand the content and exercises developed in each session, and the practical significance and impact that these computational tools have on scientific research.

Because some books use the Newtonian kinetic energy and others use the total relativistic energy (including the rest energy), the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic phase velocity differs from the Newtonian phase velocity, which can be confusing for many students. This paper proposes expressing the phase velocity by first subtracting the rest energy from the relativistic energy before imposing the usual de Broglie relations. In addition to providing the corresponding Newtonian phase velocity, it also provides a relativistic Schrdinger equation which intuitively reduces to the non-relativistic Schrdinger equation in the appropriate regime. The problem of the equivalence between the relativistic Schrdinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation is also addressed by using arguments which can be understood by undergraduate students.","[Mundarain, Douglas] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile",,"Mundarain, D (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile.",dmundarain@ucn.cl,,,,,,12,2,2,1,37,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,1361-6404,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

One does it this way because Coulomb's potential, i.e. the expression which allows for a direct calculation of the potential without first calculating the electric field, should not be used since these charge distributions are not bounded in space. Due to the unbounded nature of these distributions, Coulomb's potential diverges at all points of space in the two previously mentioned cases. However, in this work, we are going to demonstrate that in fact one can use Coulomb's potential to find the correct results by properly removing the infinities that appear in the potential of these distributions. This is possible because electric potential, like potential energy, is only defined up to an additive constant, which in the mentioned cases can be chosen as an infinite constant. One can show that the removal of these infinities is a simple example of the renormalization techniques commonly used in quantum field theory.","[Mundarain, Douglas] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile",,"Mundarain, D (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Casilla 1280, Antofagasta, Chile.",dmundarain@ucn.cl,,,,,,7,0,0,1,7,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,1361-6404,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

For real systems, however, uncertainty is largely present via external forces such as friction or lack of precise knowledge about the initial conditions of the system. In this work we focus on the latter case and describe the use of inference methodologies in solving the statistical properties of classical systems subject to uncertain initial conditions. In particular we describe the application of the formalism of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inference to the problem of projectile motion, given information about the average horizontal range over many realizations. By using MaxEnt we can invert the problem and use the provided information on the average range to reduce the original uncertainty in the initial conditions. Also, additional insight into the initial condition's probabilities, and the projectile path distribution itself, can be achieved based on the value of the average horizontal range. The wide applicability of this procedure, as well as its ease of use, reveals a useful tool with which to revisit a large number of physics problems, from classrooms to frontier research.","[Montecinos, Alejandra; Davis, Sergio; Peralta, Joaquin] Univ Andres Bello, Dept Ciencias Fis, Sazie 2212 Piso 7, Santiago, Chile; [Davis, Sergio] Comis Chilena Energia Nucl, Casilla 188-D, Santiago, Chile",,"Montecinos, A (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept Ciencias Fis, Sazie 2212 Piso 7, Santiago, Chile.",alejandramontecinos@unab.cl,"Peralta, Joaquin/A-2832-2012; Davis, Sergio/F-3415-2011; Davis, Sergio/U-7227-2019","Peralta, Joaquin/0000-0003-2934-4942; Davis, Sergio/0000-0003-2757-332X; Davis, Sergio/0000-0003-2757-332X",FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140514]; Proyecto FONDECYT IniciacionComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11130501]; Proyecto [UNAB DI-15-17/RG],"This work is supported by Proyecto FONDECYT 1140514.

We consider the physical setup where the semi-sphere is free to move over a flat surface. For simplicity, we assume that all surfaces are friction-less. We analyze the values for the last contact angle theta (&#x22c6;), corresponding to the angle when the object and the semi-sphere detach one of each other. We consider all possible scenarios with different combination of mass values: m ( A ) and m ( B ), and the initial velocity of the sliding object A. We found that the last contact angle only depends on the ratio between the masses, and it is independent of the acceleration of gravity and semi-sphere's radius. In addition, we found that the largest possible value of theta (&#x22c6;) is 48.19 degrees that coincides with the case of a fixed semi-sphere. On the opposite case, the minimum value of theta (&#x22c6;) is 0 degrees and it occurs then the object on the semi-sphere is extremely heavy, occurring the detachment as soon as the sliding body touches the semi-sphere. In addition, we found that if the initial kinetic energy of the sliding object A is half the value of the potential energy with respect to the floor.

These types of presentations are also intended for students to learn or improve oral presentation techniques, which generally enrich their communication skills. However, these activities are usually carried out without prior preparation or without well-defined terms of reference, obtaining different results, even within homogeneous groups of students. The objective of the paper is focused on determining the effect of microteaching on engineering students' oral presentation techniques and improve communications skills. To measure its impact, three courses of different levels of the civil engineering career were selected (152 students), separating in each of them two groups of students. Each group of students has been asked to prepare different oral presentations. The first group of students prepared the presentation in a traditional way, while, the second group of students prepared the presentation as if it were a microteaching session. The oral presentations of the groups were evaluated, finding that the microteaching has a favorable impact on the improvement of the communications skills of the students.","[Fernando Herrera, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Appl Comp Sci Intro Civil Engn Planning & Project, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Carlos Vielma, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Munoz La Rivera, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Struct Anal Solid Mech Numer Anal & Geotech, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile; [Fernando Herrera, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Appl Comp Sci Intro Civil Engn Planning & Project, Sch Civil Engn, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Avda Brasil 2147,Third Floor, Valparaiso, Chile.",rodrigo.herrera@pucv.cl; juan.vielma@pucv.cl; fmunozlarivera@gmail.com,"Vielma-Perez, Juan C./C-6863-2018; Mu–oz La Rivera, Felipe/AAX-9588-2021","Vielma-Perez, Juan C./0000-0001-5426-2215;",CORFO Project [14ENI2-26905 Ingenieria 2030-PUCV]; VRI Grant of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile,"The following investigation was made thanks to the contributions of the CORFO Project 14ENI2-26905 Ingenieria 2030-PUCV.

Service-learning is an active methodology that has been applied in several teaching areas and multiple areas of knowledge at college level. Several papers propose software project development based on agile methods in learning contexts, but papers focusing on efforts to combine Service-learning with agile software development methods to improve students' software development project skills are not so common. This paper reports the experience of combining Service-learning with the stages of a software development methodology inspired by Agile Manifesto. It describes a teaching innovation, which consists in providing students with an active and motivating teaching-learning environment in a computing subject to attain three objectives: (1) improving students' skills for developing high-quality software applications in a working context similar to professional software development practice; (2) decreasing the subject drop-out rate; and (3) familiarizing students with solidarity and community work. This pilot experience at a university in northern Chile involves the active participation of a community partner (Help Desk for People with Disabilities at Antofagasta Municipality). This paper describes the methodology used in the creation of a software product (prototype version) in the context of solidarity work for regional Paralympic games. The innovation was developed within the framework of a subject in the Major in Computer and Information Technology Engineering. Twelve students participated in this teaching innovation, obtaining encouraging results concerning the attainment of objectives. There was an active participation with 90% passing students; drop-outs decreased to 0%; and students worked very closely and professionally with the community partner.","[Flores, Victor] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Comp & Syst Engn, Antofagasta, Chile",,"Flores, V (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Comp & Syst Engn, Antofagasta, Chile.",vflores@ucn.cl,"Flores, Victor/AAM-5776-2021","Flores, Victor/0000-0002-6995-9434",,,,35,0,0,7,9,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

In this article, we show how polymers are taught in a department specifically dedicated to this topic. We present the history of the Department of Polymers in the Faculty of Chemical Sciences at the University of Concepcion (the only department of this type in Chile). Initially, the Department of Polymers offered a few undergraduate and graduate courses; now, polymer science courses at the University of Concepcion have become an integral part of the curriculum for seven programs-pedagogy in chemistry, biochemistry, bioengineering, civil engineering in materials, chemical analysis, chemistry, and civil engineering in chemistry. We discuss the influence of this department in the curricular design of these seven programs at the University of Concepcion. We offer a detailed description of the polymer-based courses incorporated into the curriculum of some programs, and we discuss how the numbers of graduate and undergraduate theses involving polymer science have increased at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences since the creation of the Department of Polymers in 1974.","[Flores-Morales, Patricio; Campos-Requena, Victor H.; Gatica, Nicolas; Munoz, Carla; Perez, Monica A.; Rivas, Bernabe L.; Sanchez, Susana A.; Suwalsky, Mario; Tapiero, Yesid; Urbano, Bruno F.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Quirn, Dept Polimeros, Edmundo Larenas 129, Concepcion, Chile",,"Flores-Morales, P (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Quirn, Dept Polimeros, Edmundo Larenas 129, Concepcion, Chile.",patricio.flores@udec.cl,"Urbano, Bruno F./O-3020-2019; Campos-Requena, Victor H/A-2429-2016","Urbano, Bruno F./0000-0002-5677-5505; Flores-Morales, Patricio/0000-0002-8330-3992",CREA-Quimica UdeC [UCO1403-MINEDUC],"P.F.-M. thanks H.

We study the classical behaviour of an electric dipole in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. We obtain equations and constants of motion from the Lagrangian formulation. We find an infinitely periodic effective potential that describes a rotational motion. The problem is not directly separable in relative and centre-of-mass variables, even though we are able to write the energy of the system as a function of only one term, the relative variable. We define another constant of motion, which couples the relative with the centre-of-mass variables. We describe conditions for the bound states of the dipole. In addition, we discuss the problem in the approximation of small oscillations. Finally, we explore the existence of a possible family of trapped states in a region of the space where there are no classical turning points.","Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Antofagasta, Chile",,"Troncoso, P (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Av Angamos 0610, Antofagasta, Chile.",scurilef@ucn.cl,"Curilef, Sergio/O-8481-2015","curilef, sergio/0000-0002-8318-3206; Troncoso Iribarren, Paulina/0000-0001-6162-3023",,,,13,5,5,1,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0143-0807,,,EUR J PHYS,Eur.

Our surgical educational website and its associated assets were assessed to understand how such a resource was being used. DESIGN: Our website was accessible to all Mayo Clinic employees via the internal web network. Website access data from April 2015 through October 2016 were retrospectively collected using Piwik. SETTING: Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 257 Mayo Clinic employees used the website. RESULTS: The website had 48,794 views from 6313 visits by 257 users who spent an average of 14 11 minutes on the website. Our website houses 295 videos, 51 interactive modules, 14 educational documents, and 7 flashcard tutorials. The most popular content type was videos, with a total of 30,864 views. The most popular visiting time of the day was between 8 PM and 9 PM with 6358 views (13%), and Thursday was the most popular day with 17,907 views (37%). A total of 78% of users accessed content beyond the homepage. Average visits peaked in relation to 2 components of our curriculum: a 240% increase one day before our biannual intern simulation assessments, and a 61% increase one day before our weekly conducted Friday simulation sessions. Interns who rotated on the service of the staff surgeon who actively endorses the website had 93% more actions per visit as compared to other users. The highest clicks were on the home banner for our weekly simulation session pre-emptive videos, followed by groin anatomy, and TEP hernia repair videos. CONCLUSIONS: Our website acted as a just-in-time accessible portal to reliable surgical information. It supplemented the time sensitive educational needs of our learners by serving as a heavily used adjunct to 3 components of our surgical education curriculum: weekly simulation sessions, biannual assessments, and clinical rotations.

DESIGN: Preparatory resources were mailed to match medical students before residency matriculation in 2015. This included how-to videos, low-cost models, and surgical instruments for 5 stations (arterial blood gas analysis, anatomy and imaging knowledge, knot tying ability, and suturing dexterity) of our program's biannual general surgery intern objective assessment activity (Surgical Olympics: total 13 stations, 10 points each). Scores from 2015 were compared with 2014 historical controls in a retrospective manner using the Student's t-test. SETTING: Academic, tertiary care referral center with a large general surgery training program. PARTICIPANTS: Postgraduate year 1 general surgery trainees (interns) from the years 2014 and 2015. RESULTS: Twenty-six interns participated in the 2015 assessment and were compared to thirty-two 2014 interns. Overall mean scores were low, but higher (19.7 vs. 15.4, p = 0.04) in the 2015 class. The largest increase was noted in the anatomy knowledge station (mean = 5.0 vs. 1.9, p < 0.01). Scores in stations assessing technical competence were similar to controls. The number of perfect scores among the 5 stations was higher (10 vs. 5) in the 2015 group. Mean scores from the other 8 stations, for which no resources were no difference (29.3 vs. 28.3, p = 0.75).

Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course. Our results indicate that using AR enhances the comprehension of anatomical and physiological concepts of the cardiac cycle for under-graduate biomedical students.","[Gonzalez, Alexis A.; Merino, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Chem, Valparaiso, Chile; [Lizana, Pablo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Lab Morphol Sci, Valparaiso, Chile; [Pino, Sonia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Res Educ Technol Costa Digital, Valparaiso, Chile; [Miller, Brant G.] Univ Idaho, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",,"Gonzalez, AA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Chem, Valparaiso, Chile.",alexis.gonzalez@pucv.cl,"Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019","Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Lizana, Pablo A./0000-0002-9366-6930","National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development - National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), Chile [Fondecyt 1180619]; Unidad de Mejoramiento de la Docencia (UMDU), Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso Valparaiso, Chile","This work has also been sponsored and is derived from the following projects: The National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (Fondecyt 1180619), which was funded by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), Chile, and by Unidad de Mejoramiento de la Docencia (UMDU), Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso Valparaiso, Chile.",,41,4,4,0,5,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",1043-4046,1522-1229,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

Chilean nursing is considered as the leading example of nursing education in Latin America, demanding a five-year training on a full-time university programme. The consequences of education, however, are assumed as more egalitarian opportunities, disregarding the latent replication of structures that perpetuate inequalities. Objective: To comprehend the socialisation of male nursing students and its relation with their masculine identity and the construction of inequalities in nursing education. Methods: We draw upon interviews undertaken with beginner and advanced nursing students from a Chilean university. Approval was obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee. The data were organised to allow the development of concepts by using the Grounded Theory approach. Results: The analysis uncovers paradoxical results of nursing education and its ineffectiveness in preventing gender-based inequalities. The interest in empowering nursing politically may lead to favour an increasing number of men entering nursing in ways that facilitate male students' progress. Furthermore, there exist discourses of compassion that feed consideration for male students, engendering in the process the prospect of professional success and the gravitation into strategic positions in the employment market. These are mechanisms that reproduce earlier gender-based inequalities in nursing. Conclusions: In the light of the social reproduction theory, the academisation of Chilean nursing seems to be built upon historical gender asymmetries. Although the interest of men in embracing a career in nursing may have a meaningful resonance with the transformation of contemporary society, this process needs a judicious examination in order to protect academic integrity and, ultimately, prevent the reproduction of those inequalities in question. This analysis offers a perspective for understanding social patterns embedded in the practice of nursing education in Chile and elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.","[De la Fuente, Carlos, I; Guadagnin, Eliane Celina; Kunzler, Marcos Roberto; Carpes, Felipe P.] Univ Fed Pampa, Lab Neuromech, Uruguaiana, Brazil; [De la Fuente, Carlos, I] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Dept Ciencias Salud, Carrera Kinesiol, Santiago, Chile; [De la Fuente, Carlos, I] Clin MEDS, Santiago, Chile",,"Carpes, FP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pampa, Lab Neuromech, Uruguaiana, Brazil.",carpes@unipampa.edu.br,"Guadagnin, Eliane C/F-3528-2019; Carpes, Felipe P./A-1069-2010","Guadagnin, Eliane C/0000-0003-3250-4134; Carpes, Felipe P./0000-0001-8923-4855",,,,15,2,2,2,3,AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",1043-4046,1522-1229,,ADV PHYSIOL EDUC,Adv.

The aims of this study were to: evaluate MC, provide population-based percentile values for MC; and determine the prevalence of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) in Spanish schoolchildren. METHODSThis cross-sectional study included 1562 children aged 4 to 6 years from Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. MC was assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition. Values were analyzed according to age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), environment (rural/urban), and type of school. RESULTSBoys scored higher than girls in aiming and catching, whereas girls aged 6 scored higher than boys in balance. Children living in rural areas and those attending to public schools obtained better scores in aiming and catching than those from urban areas and private schools. The prevalence of DCD was 9.9%, and 7.5% of children were at risk of having movement problems. CONCLUSIONMotor test scores can represent a valuable reference to evaluate and compare the MC in schoolchildren. Schools should identify motor problems at early ages and design initiatives which prevent or mitigate them.","[Amador-Ruiz, Santiago; Gutierrez, David; Gulias-Gonzalez, Roberto; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Ronda de Calatrava 3, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Pardo-Guijarro, Maria J.; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ctr Estudios Sociosanitarios, C Santa Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Ave Pedro de Valdivia 425, Talca 3460000, Chile; [Pardo-Guijarro, Maria J.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Camino Pozuelo S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain",,"Sanchez-Lopez, M (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Ronda de Calatrava 3, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.; Sanchez-Lopez, M (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ctr Estudios Sociosanitarios, C Santa Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain.",Santiago.Amador@alu.uclm.es; David.Gutierrez@uclm.es; Vicente.Martinez@uclm.es; Roberto.Gulias@uclm.es; MariaJesus.Pardo@uclm.es; Mairena.Sanchez@uclm.es,"VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/R-4336-2017; SANCHEZ-LOPEZ, MAIRENA/J-7933-2016","VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; Sanchez Lopez, Mairena/0000-0002-0217-0623; Gutierrez-Diaz del Campo, David/0000-0002-7805-4936","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission [FIS PI12/02400, FIS PI12/00761]; Research Network on Preventative Activities and Health Promotion [RD12/0005/0009]; Carlos III Health InstituteInstituto de Salud Carlos III","This study was funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Carlos III Health Institute, and FEDER funds (FIS PI12/02400 and FIS PI12/00761).

They form an increasingly important metric that has been assimilated as a robust proxy measure of quality for evaluating individual, institutional and even system-level performativity. Although the technical design aspects of student ratings have received extensive attention, the broad sociocultural contexts of their use in higher education settings have had considerably less attention. In this study, a meta-synthesis framed by a critical sociocultural perspective was used to investigate the social evolution of student ratings over the last four decades. The outcomes suggest that student ratings have developed through three primary motives: an originating democratic improvement imperative; a dominating quality assurance assimilation and the emerging drive of satisfying the student-as-consumer. This analysis suggests that student ratings cannot be understood only in their benign technical form but must also be considered as performing significant functions in supporting the changing social imperatives of evolving higher education policy.","[Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Darwin, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",sdarwin@uahurtado.cl,"Darwin, Stephen/AAA-5233-2020; Darwin, Stephen/AAS-9549-2020","Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451;",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170314],This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [grant number 11170314].,,62,2,2,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

There are few studies about flipped classroom characteristics that could help to improve self-regulation. This study assess the influence of choice in the goal setting process of students and their perception of clear goals while learning in flipped classes, in comparison with lecture based courses in a university-level programming class (n = 299). A method based in the progression mechanism of role playing games is used to help the goal setting process of students in the flipped classroom. Students in flipped classes perceived higher levels of choice in comparison with students in lecture based courses. The effect of choice on achievement was partially mediated by the perception of clear goals of the students and was higher in lower performing students. Our results suggest that the increased perception of choice in the flipped classroom, and their effect in achievement, complement the effect of active learning in the results obtained from flipped classroom use.

We use experimental variation in children's access to this new ASP to study the impacts on children's grades and school attendance, outcomes that were not specifically targeted by the ASP. While the ASP had no average impact on these academic outcomes, we find heterogeneous treatment effects related to the nature of counterfactual care. Children randomized into the ASP had higher school attendance and higher grades if, initially, they were not supervised by a parent at baseline. The largest positive impacts on school outcomes were found for children who at baseline spent after-school hours at home alone. For this group of counterfactually unsupervised children, the ASP's effect on student attendance persisted one year after ASP enrollment.

Admission regulations are central to understanding issues of school mix, segregation and educational justice. In Chile, student selection has been intensively discussed but scarcely studied. Using a questionnaire for headteachers (N=581), we explore how school admission processes are organised and implemented within a market-based educational system with a high-stakes testing regime where schools are pushed to use selection practices. Despite the existence of a national (although weak) legal prohibition at the time the survey was conducted, half of the headteachers state that they use some mechanism to select students (play sessions, student testing, or interviews with parents) even when they do not face demand pressures. Exploratory data suggest higher levels of selectivity in subsidised private schools. Regression analysis shows a strong association between selectivity' and homogeneous academic intake and social composition. Presumably, the widespread use of selection procedures responds to the structuring force of a double system of educational accountability; strong pressure on performance within a testing regime and where funding depends on enrolments makes selection a fundamental strategy for schools, but which is seriously affecting equality goals.","[Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Carrasco, Alejandro; Flores, Carolina] Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile; [Gutierrez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile",,"Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice, Santiago, Chile.",ajcarras@uc.cl,,"Gutierrez, Gabriel/0000-0002-6477-5783","FONIDE [711286]; Fondo de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Educacion (FONIDE), Departamento de Estudios y Desarrollo; Division de Planificacion y Presupuesto, Ministerio de Educacion, Chile","This work was supported by FONIDE [grant number 711286].

Furthermore, the classroom observations do not reveal any innovative teaching strategies, related to the use of this new technology.

In that context, this article tackles the recent equity-oriented reform introduced in the highly marketised Chilean school system. Based on in-depth interviews, we explore the responses of middle-class parents to the implementation of a new centralised admission system that modified the school choice rules. Our findings differentiate five types of responses. Alongside uncovering a significant opposition from parents for whom the reform is experienced as a threat to their middle-classness, we found a variety of stances consistent with heterogeneity within the broader middle class, and we reveal a high ambivalence in their policy interpretations. From these findings, we discuss the sociocultural complexities of reforms aimed at balancing choice and equity, and we contribute to prior literature by unravelling the nuances in the middle-class attitudes towards desegregation policies.","[Hernandez, Macarena; Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Hernandez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",mihernan@uc.cl,,,Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile: ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL [21160130]; ANID PIA CIE [160007],"This work was supported by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile: ANID PFCHA/DOCTORADO NACIONAL/2016-21160130, and ANID PIA CIE 160007.",,38,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/03057925.2020.1851592,,DEC 2020,18,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,PB9MN,WOS:000596636500001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

Its second objective was to study the relationship among these variables. Three instruments were used to quantify these variables: the Views of the Nature of Science Version D (VNOS D+), the Assessing Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORN), and the Measure of Acceptance of Theory of Evolution (MATE). The results indicate that the PDP had a positive impact on teachers, significantly improving their understanding of the NOS and natural selection, as well as their acceptance of the TE. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the understanding of the NOS obtained by teachers in the first part of the PDP and the understanding and acceptance of evolution that these teachers showed at the end of the programme was determined.

Data obtained through in-depth interviews and focus groups with administrators (N = 51) from 36 schools were analyzed using Wenger's (2000) theory of inter-organizational learning. Findings suggest that an expansion of the roles supervisors and school administrators have traditionally played in the practicum may help reduce this gap. As brokers for their respective institutions they can coordinate actions by gaining access to the meanings each community assigns to practices and acknowledging the competence each brings to the practicum.

A qualitative design involving was used, which involved a discourse analysis of the Chilean educational policy on integration, and an empirical study in three public municipal schools of one commune. Data were analyzed through pragmatic discourse analysis. Results. The Chilean educational policy is hybrid since it advocates for inclusion from within the logic of human rights, but prescribes a model of integration with a strong psycho-medical emphasis, which operates through individual diagnosis and pedagogical treatment on behalf of the special education teacher. Integration is presented as optional and complementary through the form of school integration projects (SIP) financed through individual vouchers. Local discursive practices translate this policy as a policy for the 'SIP children', that is, those who participate in these projects and, therefore, have a diagnosis and receive additional voucher. These children are labeled and segregated. Responsibility for learning outcomes falls mainly in the hands of the specialized teacher, whose work is encapsulated. Teachers believe that children s learning possibilities depends on the level of disability and family support, a belief that draws the schools away from its pedagogical function. Discussion. From the viewpoint of inclusion, these practices and conceptions create a cultural barrier, since they situate the possibilities of educational change outside the educational scope and outside the regular classroom. This places at risk the possibilities for constructing an educational system with equity.","[Lopez, Veronica; Julio, Cristina; Morales, Macarena; Rojas, Carolina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Psicol, Vina Del Mar 1290, Chile; [Victoria Perez, Maria] Univ Concepcion, Dept Psicol, Concepcion, Chile",,"Lopez, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Psicol, Av El Bosque, Vina Del Mar 1290, Chile.",veronica.lopez@ucv.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; L—pez, Ver—nica/K-5472-2014","L—pez, Ver—nica/0000-0001-7405-3859; Morales, Macarena/0000-0002-1624-4873",,,,28,13,38,2,21,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

It builds upon previous research and conceptual frameworks produced by Kember and Kwan (Instr Sci 28(5):469-490, 2000) and Roberts (Instr Sci 31(1-2):127-150, 2003). It advances research on conceptions of, and approaches to, teaching by examining teaching in a novel context: distance-taught courses at the postgraduate level. Lecturers were interviewed from a Faculty of Health Sciences in a research-intensive Australian University. Relationships between conceptions and approaches found in previous research were confirmed in this study. However, it was found that the conceptions of online teaching proposed by Roberts (Instr Sci 31(1-2):127-150, 2003) did not adequately distinguish between the conceptions held by the lecturers interviewed in this study. Three modified conceptions of online teaching are proposed: 'for individual access to learning materials and information; and for individual assessment'; 'for learning related communication (asynchronous and/or synchronous)'; and 'as a medium for networked learning'. Some of the dimensions developed by Roberts to describe approaches to online teaching were not applicable in this study setting and needed further modification. Two broad approaches emerged: 'informative/individual learning focused' and 'communicative/networked learning focused'. Contextual influences on teaching reported by Kember and Kwan (Instr Sci 28(5):469-490, 2000)-that is, institutional influence, nature of students and subject and curriculum-were revealed in this study to have different levels of influence over approaches to online teaching: the first two being the more relevant ones.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Gonzalez, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Av Vicuna Mackena 4860, Santiago, Chile.",cgonzalu@uc.cl,"Gonz‡lez, Carlos/D-7228-2017","Gonz‡lez, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777",,,,22,49,49,3,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Formative assessment represents a set of student-centered practices, the results of which are not always optimal. Furthermore, different technologies are better suited to certain tasks than to others. The study follows a Design-Based Research approach and was conducted in Chile in two phases. In the first phase of the study, a formative assessment strategy for teaching spelling is developed. In a subsequent phase, the impact of different technologies on this strategy is analyzed. This is achieved by comparing two different technologies: Tablet PCs and the interpersonal computer. The results reveal that a self-paced formative assessment strategy using Tablets is more effective than the same strategy using an interpersonal computer when teaching spelling to primary school students. This therefore highlights the impact of technology on learning when adopting a formative assessment strategy.","[Vasquez, Andrea; Sciarresi, Enzo; Martinez, Tomas] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Barahona, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Vasquez, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile.",afvasque@uc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; wang, xinyi/J-9100-2017","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798",Chile CONICYT-FONDECYT [1150045],"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by Chile CONICYT-FONDECYT grant 1150045.",,68,4,4,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0735-6331,1541-4140,,J EDUC COMPUT RES,J.

J,"BRUNNER, JJ",,,,"BRUNNER, JJ",,,CHILES HIGHER-EDUCATION - BETWEEN MARKET AND STATE,higher education,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Presently, most Higher Education policy issues that are debated in Chilean society revolve around the question of the type of relations that should connect the Higher Education system with the state and society. During the 1980-1990 period, Chilean Higher Education underwent drastic changes under a Military Government, directed to the achieving of three main goals: to open-up the Higher Education system, to differentiate its institutional structures, and to partially transfer the cost of state-financed institutions to the students and/or their families (cost recovery) thus forcing these institutions to diversify their funding sources. As a result of the 1980 reforms, both the institutional composition and the financing of Higher Education experienced dramatic changes. New establishments mushroomed. In tum, the rapid increase in the number of institutions resulted in three major effects: first, Higher Education became private-dominant in the non-university levels and has now a dual public/private nature at the university level; second, establishments grew more regionally dispersed but overall enrolment distribution changed in the direction of a still higher concentration in the capital city; third, creation of new entrance opportunities shows an increasing over-extension with respect to enrolment demand. Also funding of Higher Education was drastically altered by the 1980 reforms. Incremental funding was replaced by a diversified funding system which contemplates the employment of four different mechanisms: public institutional core funding, competitive public allocations rewarding institutions that enrol the best students, a Government financed student-loan scheme, and competitive financing of research projects. A new, democratically elected Government was established in 1990. Its Higher Education policies include three major objectives: to fully restore institutional autonomy cancelling all measures of governmental intervention and reinstating the right of faculty members to freely choose their authorities and provide for the self-government of public universities; to increase public spending without changing the diversified-funding approach adopted by the former Government, and to change the legal framework of Higher Education with the aim of introducing more stringent accreditation and evaluation procedures and institutional accountability.",,,"BRUNNER, JJ (corresponding author), FLACSO, LEOPOLDO URRUTIA 1950, CASILLA 3213, CORREO CENT, SANTIAGO, CHILE.",,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021","Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237",,,,10,7,11,0,22,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Conversely, the competencies required for the workforce have been slower to emerge. This paper examines the incidence of qualification and skill mismatches across different populations, across age groups, gender, and educational levels. The discrepancy between the qualifications and skills possessed by workers, and those required to perform their jobs is measured using the Survey of Adult Skills-PIAAC and a national socioeconomic survey. Our results suggest that overeducation is increasing across time, affecting mainly younger, higher educated workers. Overskilling is also a widespread phenomenon among this group, probably due to a crowding out process. Moreover, the high competition for accessing the best positions is leading to credential inflation. Thus, the axiom that education per se leads to a good job, which guides much student decision-making, seems increasingly diffuse and requires urgent review.","[Sevilla, Maria-Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile; [Farias, Mauricio] Fdn Impulso Tek, Santiago, Chile",,"Sevilla, MP (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",msevilla@uahurtado.cl,"Sevilla, Mar’a Paola/AAH-7102-2019; Farias, Mauricio/D-7759-2013","Sevilla, Mar’a Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272; Farias, Mauricio/0000-0002-9679-4882",,,,31,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,FEB 17,2020,50,2,,,SI,,276,293,,10.1080/03057925.2019.1675495,,OCT 2019,18,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,KH3GY,WOS:000489974300001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

The research used in this study employed a mixed-method approach and combined quantitative and qualitative techniques for the purpose of sampling teacher educators from four pre-service Chilean teacher education programs. Data were collected by means of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive analyses and the dialogic discourse analysis method. Results revealed that most teacher educators are characterized as being part of a heterogeneous group, with significant classroom experience shared in common. Furthermore, the findings showed that there was a tendency within this group to focus more on their role as teachers rather than researchers. Additionally, studies also revealed that on the whole this group received little support in their early years as teacher educators. The conclusions drawn gave rise to several suggestions, all of which should be taken into consideration when preparing the next generation of teacher educators.","[Montenegro Maggio, Helena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Maggio, HM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin,Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",hlmonten@uc.cl,"Montenegro, Helena/P-2372-2017","Montenegro, Helena/0000-0002-0090-3889",,,,65,10,12,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1941-5257,1941-5265,,PROF DEV EDUC,Prof. Dev.

I follow 'impact' through texts, events and testimonies about its doings with a special interest in its creation, its polemical encounter with philosophers, its management and issues about its definition and the assessment criteria used and experienced by philosophers. I conclude with some remarks on the effects that the circulation and writing of impact case studies had on producing a social valorisation and attachment to impact, even amongst philosophers.","[Salinas, Francisco J.] Univ Alfonso Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile",,"Salinas, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Alfonso Ibanez, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile.",francisco.salinas.1@edu.uai.cl,,,Universidad Adolfo Ibanez [UAI Postdoctoral Project 2021],Universidad Adolfo Ibanez [UAI Postdoctoral Project 2021];,,57,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

However, studying critical thinking from the teacher's perspective is key to closing the gap between theory and practice. This study looks to characterize the work done by Spanish-speaking teachers in Latin America to integrate critical thinking into their practice. To do so, an online survey was sent to the participants of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), asking them to describe their work with critical thinking in their classroom. Responses from 278 participantes were then analysed using an exploratory sequential design. During the qualitative phase, a series of categories emerged based on the topics chosen by the teachers, the activities they proposed, and how they linked these to the development of critical thinking. The frequency with which these categories appeared in the teachers' responses was then measured during a subsequent quantitative phase. Variations in these frequencies were also analysed based on the subjects taught by the teachers and the age of the students. The results reveal that teachers primarily try to develop their students' critical thinking skills by integrating them into their subjects; not teaching them separately. Furthermore, they do so by choosing topics that help the students understand the world better from different subject-specific practices. Therefore, when implemented by teachers, critical thinking is highly dependent on the subject. These results suggest that there is a mismatch between educational practice and existing research, which tends to advocate the specific and explicit teaching of critical thinking, whether as a separate subject or through a cross-curriculum approach.","[Caceres, Martin; Nussbaum, Miguel; Ortiz, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile",,"Caceres, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.",mecacere@uc.cl,,,[FONDECYT/CONICYT1180024],This paper had the support of FONDECYT/CONICYT1180024,,72,10,10,8,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1871-1871,1878-0423,,THINK SKILLS CREAT,Think.

Following this line of research, the present study is based in the Mathematics Teacher's Specialized Knowledge (MTSK) model, which includes two domains of knowledge, namely, mathematical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Through an instrumental case study, classroom observation, and a semi-structured interview, we inquire how the knowledge of practices in mathematics, one of the subdomains of mathematical knowledge, is related to the pedagogical content knowledge of a lecturer in a real analysis course. The results show relationships between these subdomains considering their nature of support or conditioning. In this regard, the lecturer's knowledge of practices in mathematics conditions his/her knowledge of mathematics teaching (e.g. techniques, metaphors, and analogies). So, a lecturer's teaching goal is that students, in addition to understanding the mathematical contents, learn how to think mathematically to validate and construct arguments. Additionally, a lecturer's knowledge of students' weaknesses in carrying out proofs and working with quantifiers is supported by his/her knowledge of practice in mathematics (e.g. different methods of proofs and statements with quantifiers, as well as their meaning). In this respect, the nature of relationships between two or three subdomains of the MTSK model contributes to understanding how the lecturer's knowledge is integrated and is a good starting point for investigating the development of lecturers' mathematical and pedagogical knowledge.","[Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa; Zakaryan, Diana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Delgado-Rebolledo, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso, Chile.",rosamdelgadorebolledo@gmail.com; diana.zakaryan@pucv.cl,"Zakaryan, Diana/L-5569-2018; Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa/ABA-9859-2021","Zakaryan, Diana/0000-0002-3400-8399; Delgado-Rebolledo, Rosa/0000-0003-3162-314X",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21170442],"The Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Beca de Doctorado ano 2017, folio 21170442 is gratefully acknowledged.",,55,5,5,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1571-0068,1573-1774,,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

By using propensity score methods, we find that attending a Bicentenario school improves students' performance by a range of 0.35 to 0.23 SD in language and 0.5 to 0.35 SD in math. Also, we show that a proportion of this effect is due to the outstanding performance of the new Bicentenario schools as opposed to the restructured version of the program. We prove the robustness of the previous results through falsification, changes-in-changes, and a more demanding control group.

However, there is also evidence that when students discuss their ideas with their peers, the gains are delayed rather than being immediately evident. Moreover, group outcomes do not seem to be related to individual gains. It is hypothesized that peer discussions trigger a metacognitive process that, in turn, prompts the post-collaborative settlement of students' differences. In classroom settings, it is likely that whole-class interaction plays a relevant role, but this has not yet been properly explored. We conducted a case study with the aim of describing how whole-class interaction may contribute to students' knowledge transformation initiated during peer discussions. We followed one group of four students during a whole unit (Forces) and described how progressive small-group and whole-class interactions prompt the transformation of some notions (gravity and magnetic force) from pre- to post-tests, while leaving others almost unchanged. The results suggest that, while rich peer argumentation around contradictory ideas (discussion) followed by repetitive whole-class arguments may contribute to the progressive transformation of scientific ideas, the mere expression of contradictory ideas, involving tangential argumentation and followed by authoritative whole-class corrections but no arguments, only partially leads to changes. The internalization of the whole-class argument facilitated by peer discussions may enable students to reason in new situations.","[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina; Lopez, Patricia; Moran, Camila] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,"Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231","Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431]","This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants no 1140995 and 1170431.",,51,0,0,3,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2210-6561,,,LEARN CULT SOC INTER,Learn.

The PDP spanned a semester and included activities such as content updates, collaborative lesson planning, and the presentation of planned lessons. In the follow-up part, the lessons were videotaped and analysed, identifying strategies, activities, and conditions based on student learning about the theory of evolution. Data were collected in the first round with an interview before the training process, identifying these teachers' initial content representation (CoRe) for evolution. Then, a group interview was conducted after the lessons, and, finally, an interview of stimulated recall with each teacher was conducted regarding the subject taught to allow teachers to reflect on their practice (final CoRe). This information was analysed by the teachers and the researchers, reflecting on the components of the PCK, possible changes, and the rationale behind their actions. The results show that teachers changed their beliefs and knowledge about the best methods and strategies to teach evolution, and about students' learning obstacles and misconceptions on evolution. They realised how a review of their own practices promotes this transformation.","[Bravo, Paulina; Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@ucv.cl,,", hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X",Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [N 1131029],"This work was supported by Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), Grant [N 1131029 to HC].",,55,13,14,3,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

This paper studies the relationship between the secondary school track attended by Chilean students (vocational or academic) and their subsequent outcomes in access to and persistence in postsecondary vocational programs. Although it is expected that vocational students will display lower access to higher education programs, due to their less intense curriculum and the generally non-academic environment of their schools, their performance in post-secondary vocational programs is unclear. Field-specific knowledge and vocational maturity could improve the performance of students from secondary vocational education backgrounds. Our analysis uses propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and determine causal relationships. It also utilizes sensitivity analysis to check for the robustness of results. The findings reveal that, indeed, vocational students have lower rates of access and persistence than academic ones. Students who change fields between secondary and postsecondary education have the lowest persistence levels. We also found that vocational students have lower probabilities of access to higher education funding, and higher probabilities of enrolling in evening classes. Thus, when controlling for these two characteristics, we found that students who continue in the same vocational field between secondary and postsecondary levels had a better performance than students with an academic background. These findings may suggest that vocational students require greater support in order to increase their probabilities of success in higher education.","[Farias, Mauricio] Superintendence Educ Chile, Inspecting Div, Santiago, Chile; [Paola Sevilla, Maria] Diego Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile",,"Farias, M (corresponding author), Superintendence Educ Chile, Inspecting Div, Santiago, Chile.",mauricio_farias@yahoo.com; paola.sevilla@gmail.com,"Sevilla, Mar’a Paola/AAH-7102-2019; Farias, Mauricio/D-7759-2013","Sevilla, Mar’a Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272; Farias, Mauricio/0000-0002-9679-4882","CONICYT, Programa de Insercion de Capital Humano Avanzado [781204034]","We thank the data provided by the Centro de Estudios from the Ministry of Education-Chile.

This paper analyzes the barriers school administrators from Chile identified for their schools' involvement in the practicum scheme. Data were produced through a survey (N=172) and in-depth interviews (N=51) with administrators in schools hosting teacher candidates. Few participants (4%) identified barriers implicating a sense of shared school-university responsibility for the success of the practicum. About a third of the barriers identified pertain to within school factors, such as teachers' and parents' reluctance to host candidates. From these administrator's perspectives, a distance with the host school is produced through a number of factors attributed to the universities' curricula and management. Administrators manage this distance to leverage better learning opportunities for their school's pupils, for prospective teachers, and for the school staff. Findings contribute to the discussion of policies and practices to strengthen school-university partnerships, highlighting the importance of including school administrators as key contributors.

This pandemic has emphasized the need to improve the teaching process through the use of innovating educational tools, such as mobile augmented reality (mAR). This pilot study intends to evaluate the relationship between motivation and meaningful learning for university students through mAR, as well as the effects and implications of its use how supporting teaching activities in an Industrial Design and Technical Drawing course. A quantitative method research approach was applied to collect, process, and analyze the research data of the students' perception under the health restrictions caused by the current pandemic, using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS). The total number of questionnaires collected was 96, applied to students of the Industrial Engineering major at Universidad Catolica del Maule in Chile. The instrument's reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha, giving an overall value of 0.89. The implementation of an instructional model called ARCS (Attention-Relevance-Confidence-Satisfaction) was achieved. The implementation of mRA was positively valued by most of the students surveyed. An increase the percentage of students who achieved the expected learning objectives was found, in compared to previous versions of the course (without mAR). Finally, the results demonstrate a positive relation between mAR and the learning level achieved by students. There was no evidence of negative effects under the particular imposed conditions, because of sanitary restrictions when implementing the mAR.","[Laurens-Arredondo, Luis] Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Chile",,"Laurens-Arredondo, L (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Chile.",llaurens@ucm.cl,,"Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/0000-0002-2140-6275",,,,69,0,0,8,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

'Having the vocation' has become a regime of truth that regulates and governs educators' behaviours, motivations and relationships in their workplace. By deconstructing the concept of vocation through a poststructuralist and feminist theory, I show the arising tensions in this discourse, emphasising that it positions female early childhood educators as a subject of both exploitation and admiration. Vocation shapes early years practitioners not only as nurturing and caring, but deeply altruist, devoted and self-sacrificed women seeking (eternal) salvation. Exposing the contradictory nature of this discourse, the article highlights its tensions with the professionalization of the early years workforce. Whilst vocation situates practitioners as good educators and morally good women, it allows for workforce exploitation, trapping them in hazardous working conditions.","[Poblete Nunez, Ximena] Univ Andres Bello, Psychol Dept, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile",,"Nunez, XP (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Psychol Dept, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile.",xpoblete@cepinfancia.cl,"Nu–ez, Ximena Poblete/AAZ-3168-2021; Nu–ez, Ximena Poblete/Z-1505-2019","Nu–ez, Ximena Poblete/0000-0002-8604-1473;",,,,54,1,1,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-0253,1360-0516,,GENDER EDUC,Gend.

In massive courses where there are a variety of activities, automated analysis techniques are required in order to process the large volume of information that is generated, to help teachers take timely and appropriate actions. In these scenarios, it is convenient to classify students into a small number of groups that can receive dedicated support. Using only online activity to group students has proven to be insufficient to characterize relevant groups, because of that this study proposes to understand differences in online activity using differences in course status and learning experience, using data from a programming course (n = 409). The model built shows that learning experience can be categorized in three groups, each with different academic performance and distinct online activity. The relationship between groups and online activity allowed us to build classifiers to detect students who are at risk of failing the course (AUC = 0.84) or need special support (AUC = 0.73), providing teachers with a useful mechanism for predicting and improving student outcomes.","[Schwarzenberg, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile; [Navon, Jaime; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Schwarzenberg, P (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Sch Engn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile.",pablo.schwarzenberg@unab.cl; jnavon@uc.cl; mar.perez@uc.cl,"Navon, Jaime/D-9095-2014","Navon, Jaime/0000-0003-4960-8386",,,,33,3,3,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1042-1726,1867-1233,,J COMPUT HIGH EDUC,J.

In this study, we examine and analyse evidence from teaching practica to assess the success of ICT - specifically the interactive whiteboard - as a teaching tool, using a qualitative method. The accounts are first-hand, scientific reflections made by student teachers from La Serena, Chile, during their teaching practicum in primary schools; for this reason they are extremely useful in analysing this teaching tool's effectiveness in the classroom. Among the main results for students' perceptions of incorporating technology as part of their training, we found a set of variables for good practice when using the interactive whiteboard, including: incorporating technology as an engaging didactic resource; making the most of technology for improving learning; determining when best to use the whiteboard; and identifying any limiting factors together with students' suggestions for improvement.","[Olivares, Daniela D.; Castillo, Rodrigo R.] Univ La Serena Chile, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile",,"Olivares, DD (corresponding author), Univ La Serena Chile, Benavente 980, La Serena, Chile.",danielaolivaresdiaz@gmail.com,,"Olivares, Daniela/0000-0002-1703-718X",,,,16,2,2,4,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

The results of the experiment indicate that all three groups achieved an increase in learning, as shown by the pretest and posttest scores. No significant difference was found between the interpersonal computer and personal computer groups. This suggests that the key characteristic shared by the two groups is the provision of feedback. The format that such feedback takes, either private (through a personal screen) or public (through a shared screen), is shown to make no difference.

Then we show an additional characteristic of the obstacle, that we call resistance. Subsequently, we use various theoretical approaches, properly didactic, to go into the question. Lastly, we put forward some reflections that can be derived from our study.","[Mena-Lorca, Arturo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Mena-Lorca, Arturo; Mena-Lorca, Jaime; Montoya-Delgadillo, Elizabeth; Morales, Astrid; Parraguez, Marcela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Mena-Lorca, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Invest Avanzada Educ, Valparaiso, Chile.",arturo.mena@ucv.cl; jmena@ucv.cl; emontoya@ucv.cl; ammorale@ucv.cl; marcela.parraguez@ucv.cl,,"Mena-Lorca, Jaime/0000-0003-2274-4716; Parraguez, Marcela/0000-0002-6164-3056; Mena-Lorca, Arturo/0000-0002-8150-2832",,,,65,3,3,1,2,CLAME-COMITE LATINOAMERICANO MAT EDUC,SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO,"OFFICE 101 AV INST POLITECNICO NACIONAL 2508, SAN PEDRO ZACATENCO, CP 07360, MEXICO",1665-2436,2007-6819,,REV LAT AM INV MAT E,Rev.

In this article I want to problematise the authoritative regulatory discourse of policies on international students in the United States (US) particularly after 9/11/2001 and how they maintain an essentialising notion of identity. Starting from this analysis I want to argue for the reframing of international students as co-producers of knowledge by questioning the more pragmatic sense of what internationalising higher education means. In the process I raise a range of relevant questions such as the ways policies are forms of cultural production condition experience, interpretation and reality (Campbell, 2000, 34). This has emerged from my doctoral dissertation in which I was located as an international student. This experience made me question how the subjectivity of international students is posited in policy documents and research in the United States.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Matus, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile.",,"Matus, Claudia/A-6840-2017","Matus, Claudia/0000-0002-9180-8237",,,,20,2,2,1,11,PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION,PRETORIA,"UNIV PRETORIA, GROENKLOOF CAMPUS, FACULTY EDUCATION, PRETORIA 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-2236,,,PERSPECT EDUC,Perspect.

As a result, the role of principals has become increasingly challenging and stressful, having a negative impact on principals' attraction and retention, job satisfaction as well as their mental and physical health. This paper explores how a group of 21 Chilean school principals working in the Valparaiso Region experience stress, based on individual semi-structured interviews about their subjective experiences in their role. Findings suggest that principals consider their work to be challenging, associated with several demanding situations in their schools which contribute to feeling stress. Stressors identified by principals can be organized into three groups: work-related, such as dealing with bureaucratic pressures and lack of support from municipal authorities; relationship-related, such as managing relations with a wide range of school actors and the emotional burden of interacting with them; and time-related, such as being always available to solve problems and feeling isolated in this task.","[Aravena, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Cardenal Raul Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile",,"Aravena, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",felipe.aravena@pucv.cl; agonzalezt@ucsh.cl,"Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/ABA-3272-2021","Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409",,,,63,0,0,1,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0738-0593,1873-4871,,INT J EDUC DEV,Int.

One of Chile's largest higher education institutions, which has an important number of mature students from more deprived social sectors, was used as a case study. A quantitative methodology was applied, based on the estimation of logistic regression models, where freshmen dropout rates were defined as the dependent variable and three types of independent variable were considered: family/demographic conditions, socio-economic situation and institutional structures. The results indicate that students who are parents, have a job, are not the heads of their households, are enrolled in longer programmes and who attended adult high school are more likely to drop out of higher education during their first year of study. Suggestions for institutional practices to better integrate mature students into higher education are discussed.","[Venegas-Muggli, Juan I.] Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Dept Inst Anal, Santiago, Chile",,"Venegas-Muggli, JI (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Chile INACAP, Dept Inst Anal, Chancellors Off, Ave Vitacura 10151, Santiago, Chile.",jvenegasm@inacap.cl,"Venegas-Muggli, Juan Ignacio/AAE-8612-2019","Venegas-Muggli, Juan Ignacio/0000-0003-4608-1865",,,,51,1,1,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0158-037X,1470-126X,,STUD CONTIN EDUC,Stud.

To date, few studies have examined how touchscreen devices may influence primary school students' reading and writing practices. Guided by Vygotsky's notion of co-construction and aspects of the New London Group's multiliteracies framework, we built an original multimodal tablet tool and examined how 51 third graders in Costa Rica used it to co-construct and design meaning in a reading-to-writing activity. The first aim of this study, therefore, is to understand how multimodality and technology can work together to support young people's reading and writing. Secondly, we asked how a specific interactive, touchscreen feature might positively contribute to third graders' writing samples. The key findings were that the tool used in this study encouraged a broad range of writing practices, that the touch feature supported co-construction, and that the careful integration of touchscreen features can engage and motivate students in reading and writing activities.","[Cordero, Kristina; Nussbaum, Miguel; Ibaseta, Valentina; Jose Otaiza, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Escuela Ingn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Letras, Santiago, Chile",,"Cordero, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Escuela Ingn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",kcordero@uc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",LACCIR Latin American and Caribbean Collaborative ICT Research Federation [R1212LAC003]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Fondecyt 115045],"LACCIR Latin American and Caribbean Collaborative ICT Research Federation, Grant/Award Number: R1212LAC003; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: Fondecyt 115045",,94,6,6,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

We contend that the use of discourses of diversity, as reproducing the separation between mainstream subjectivities and those uncontained by the category of normal, is one of the ways universities align themselves with the rules of a democratic society, based on ideas of multicultural understandings and tolerant communities proliferated by inter-governmental institutions such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and others. Our interest is to question the marginalization of cultural politics through the intensification of these discourses. At the same time, we explore the relations between the advancement of neutral discourses of difference and the value-free practices expressed in neoliberal educational agendas. We use discourse analysis to read interviews with future teachers. We understand students' narratives as perpetuating normative ways of thinking and legitimating those knowledges promoted by institutional curricula.","[Matus, Claudia; Infante, Marta] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Matus, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",cmatusc@uc.cl,"Matus, Claudia/A-6840-2017; Infante, Marta/B-2097-2017","Matus, Claudia/0000-0002-9180-8237; Infante, Marta/0000-0003-0295-1478",,,,17,22,32,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0159-6306,,,DISCOURSE-ABINGDON,Discourse,,2011,32,3,,,,,293,307,PII 938062190,10.1080/01596306.2011.573248,,,15,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,772YO,WOS:000291274400001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,discourse-studies in the cultural politics of education,Q2

Their fantasy narratives present multiple challenges created by the virtual environment and/or other players. The games' potential for education stems from the fact that players are immersed in a virtual world where they have the opportunity to manipulate and explore, thus motivating the construction of knowledge. The interaction and collaboration between participants allows students to exchange information, test their understanding and reflect on what they have learned. Given the promising results of using MMORPG technologies for educational purposes, this paper translates the multiplayer role playing game (MRPG) aspect, the essential concept behind MMORPGs, into the classroom context. We present the abstraction behind a Classroom Multiplayer Presential Role Playing Game (CMPRPG) and the development of a CMPRPG for teaching ecology. The game has a quest structure in which each result highlights a key teaching objective. It is implemented at a high level, with interaction between reusable game elements defined using triggers. It is observed that the implemented CMPRPG has appropriate usability levels, benefits the learning and application of the concepts of ecology and, in the interactive dimensions, it encourages participation and collaborative narrative structures among participants.","[Susaeta, Heinz; Jimenez, Felipe; Nussbaum, Miguel; Gajardo, Ignacio; Jose Andreu, Juan; Villalta, Marco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ciencia Computac, Santiago, Chile",,"Susaeta, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ciencia Computac, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",mn@ing.puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Villalta, Marco/B-9555-2012","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Villalta, Marco/0000-0002-7553-925X",,,,41,33,34,0,27,"NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN",DOULIU CITY,"NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNKIN COUNTY, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Moreover, whilst great relevance has been given to aspects such as innovation factors, product results, cognitive knowledge, poor attention has been given to other fundamental factors: product development process and effectiveness of design process as a consequence of complex problem situation. A formalization in affordances of design process may help overcome said issues and enhance product effectiveness, by identifying and highlighting potential designers' workload perception during the Product Development Process. In this scenario, this paper describes an approach for continuously monitoring and measuring the complexity of design process during the creation of a new product. After an overview of the related work, this study proposes a common instructional design model for Product Development Process, which was split in order to be measured by using NASA-TLX. This research propose that the use of NASA-TLX to predict and measure the designer workload during the design process contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among the different design phases and designer workload.

Surprisingly, many countries have not paid the necessary attention to secondary school dropout, which mainly affects poor students. Strategies to prevent dropout are ineffective and dropout rates not only don't drop but tend to increase. The case of Chile is used in this article as a reference to analyse the weaknesses and faults of implemented policies and alternative policy options recommended as promising by the literature are discussed. They are based on the decentralization of responsibilities and decisions to the local level administration and on the coordinated action of all stakeholders involved, including communities and families. The article highlight the magnitude of the secondary dropout problem and proposes policy options that may lead to a gradual increase of the percentage of students that finish school and thus, face better options for their future.","[Espinola Hoffmann, Viola] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Reg Metropolita, Chile",,"Hoffmann, VE (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Fac Educ, Vergara 210-8370067, Santiago, Reg Metropolita, Chile.",viola.espinola@udp.cl,,,,,,40,1,1,0,7,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,,,REV EDUC,Rev.

University presidents have played an increasingly important and complex role in this process. Meanwhile, understanding what happens at the very top of universities and who governs them is long overdue. Thus far, no study has attempted to understand what drives university presidents' survival in Chile. Drawing on scholarship on university presidents' turnover and on presidential survival from political science, we approach universities as political entities in which actors compete for power and office. Using an original dataset, we quantitatively analyze 236 presidents from 60 different Chilean universities between 1990 and 2019 to determine why some presidents stay in office while other involuntarily steps down. Our results show that survival is chiefly explained by the university's level of institutionalization (accreditation and year of foundation), whether it is public (state-owned) or private, and the frequency of street protests against presidents.","[Martinez, Christopher A.; Arellano, Juan Carlos] Univ Catolica Temuco, Manuel Montt 056, Temuco 4813302, Chile",,"Martinez, CA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Manuel Montt 056, Temuco 4813302, Chile.",christopher.martinez@uct.cl; jarellano@uct.cl,"Mart’nez, Christopher A/C-7570-2014","Mart’nez, Christopher A/0000-0001-5612-6567",FONDECYT Iniciacio'nComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160438]; Chile's Comision Nacional de Inivestgacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Proyecto VIP UCT [2020REG-CM-03]; Universidad Cato'lica de Temuco's Vicerrectori'a de Investigacio'n y Postgrado,"Our research has been funded by (a) FONDECYT Iniciacio'n, Grant No. 11160438, from Chile's Comision Nacional de Inivestgacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), and (b) Proyecto VIP UCT, Grant No. 2020REG-CM-03, from Universidad Cato'lica de Temuco's Vicerrectori'a de Investigacio'n y Postgrado.",,52,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

International Journal of Science Education, 24(4), 357-368. doi:10.1080/09500690110066485). The study covered 290 students in three schools in different parts of Chile. Results showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.86 and medium correlation between the dimensions of the instrument. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the five dimensions' theoretical structure is supported by the data, and one-way ANOVA and a t-test showed a balanced, non-discriminatory instrument that is suited for use in the Spanish language. The instrument also showed that Chilean students most need improvement in two of the dimensions - 'understanding of scientific models in terms of exact replicas' and the 'use of scientific models'. This reflects the original data analysed by Treagust et al. (2002) and suggests that these factors are common issues in the teaching and learning of scientific models. Future research will review the data by year and group to determine how students develop the idea of a scientific model and relate this information to science curricula. It will also investigate the link between students' understanding of scientific models and Anderson & Krathwohl's (2001) cognitive taxonomy.","[Villablanca, S.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Programa Pedag Ciencias & Matemat, Santiago, Chile; [Montenegro, M.] Factoria Ideas, Santiago, Chile; [Ramos-Moore, E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Fis, Santiago, Chile",,"Villablanca, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Programa Pedag Ciencias & Matemat, Santiago, Chile.",savillablanca@uc.cl,,"Villablanca, Steffan/0000-0001-8027-827X",,,,26,2,2,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

Inspired by feminist geographers, it considers the nation as an affective device and geopolitics as the power asymmetries resulting from the encounter of different corporealities. Three cases are used to produce narratives about the affective geopolitics influencing Colombian doctoral students in Chile by analysing how their trajectories create unbalanced powers and affect how they live and re-signify their bodies and nationality. The results indicate that, by presenting themselves as Colombians, students are associated with stigmatised Colombian bodies, which include the notions that they are sexually reified, black, poor, and vulgar. At the same time, they try to dissolve the stereotype of the Colombian person in Chile and use their privileged positions as high-skilled graduate students to detach from the great Colombian immigrant flow.","[Martinez, Cesar Augusto Ferrari] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Martinez, CAF (corresponding author), Fac Educ, 4860 Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.",cesarfmartinez@yahoo.com.br,"Ferrari Martinez, Cesar Augusto/G-1031-2017","Ferrari Martinez, Cesar Augusto/0000-0003-1012-8975",Chilean Commission for Science and Technology [21160217],This research was funded by Chilean Commission for Science and Technology under the Grant #21160217.,,51,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/03057925.2020.1847045,,NOV 2020,14,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,OV5YW,WOS:000592286100001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

These explanations serve to clarify concepts, procedures, facts, ideas, or types of problems, and are aimed at promoting student understanding. The low performance of Chilean science teachers on explanations has led us to incorporate instances in chemistry teachers education specifically aimed at developing the necessary skills to construct subject-adequate science teaching explanations. The objective of this research was to characterize the transference of the components of preservice teachers' subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. Through a qualitative methodology with an exploratory case study approach, we analyzed a total of 112 scientific explanations constructed by 28 chemistry preservice teachers throughout a 4-month training process. Our results show that, for the analyzed sample, the formulation of subject-adequate science teaching explanations involve different components whose development has distinctive characteristics. The criteria associated with the form of the explanations, which depend on teachers' discursive knowledge, can be developed in teachers' education through recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The criteria associated with the function of the explanations, which depend on teachers' content knowledge, require other strategies besides the disciplinary courses and recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations, to get teachers to formulate subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The work developed can provide instructional and evaluative strategies for science teachers' education, oriented to one of the teaching core practices that requires our attention as teacher trainers.","[Marzabal, Ainoa; Moreira, Patricia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Merino, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Chem, Ave Brasil 2950, Valparaiso, Chile; [Delgado, Virginia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Chem & Pharm, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Marzabal, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 4860, Chile.",amarzabal@uc.cl; cristian.merino@pucv.cl; pmmoreira@uc.cl; vcdelgad@uc.cl,"Merino, Cristian/O-1914-2019; Moreira, Patricia/K-6925-2017","Merino, Cristian/0000-0002-1156-2581; Marzabal, Ainoa/0000-0003-0108-5889; Moreira, Patricia/0000-0002-2055-6124; Delgado-Chang, Virginia/0000-0001-6299-4686",Comision Nacional de Investigacion cientifica y tecnologica (CONICYT) of ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [1160148],"This study is part of the project Fondecyt Regular 1160148, funded by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion cientifica y tecnologica (CONICYT) of Chile.",,40,0,0,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0157-244X,1573-1898,,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

To this end, we assessed 286 Chilean primary education students: 86 with a high SEL and 200 with a low level. The results show that the high-SEL group obtained consistently higher scores than their peers with low SEL levels in both reading and maths tasks as well as in EF measurements. This suggests that SEL could influence the development of these variables.

Results show that those university teachers who have completed the programme have, in their courses, students who were more likely to declare having adopted a deep approach to studying than those teachers who have not participated in the diploma. At the same time, no significant impact was found on the student learning experience. For practical purposes, this investigation provides evidence for the value of teaching development programmes in promoting deeper approaches to studying. For research purposes, it proposes the use of multilevel models to evaluate the impact of university teaching diplomas.","[Marchant, Jorge] Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Pregrad, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Faure, Jaime] Univ Andres Bello, Vicerrectoria Acad, Santiago, Chile",,"Marchant, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Pregrad, Santiago, Chile.",jorge.marchant@udp.cl,"Gonz‡lez, Carlos/D-7228-2017","Gonz‡lez, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777; marchant, jorge/0000-0003-4207-3817",,,,36,3,3,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0260-2938,1469-297X,,ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU,Assess.

Our main result is the presentation of six such domains that have been proposed in the existing literature: instrumental/technological, pedagogical/curricular, didactic/methodological, evaluative/investigative, communicational/relational and personal/attitudinal. A set of teaching competencies for each domain is also identified.

In the text, we analyze the reasons, presented and studied from a comparative perspective between both contexts, which lead to this assertion. Among them, the existing colonial legacy, the social, political and economic circumstances in the present Latin-American region, the rigid teaching structures and the political economy of its national higher education systems. These elements, interpreted as limits in the actual Latin American horizon, do not foreclose the possibility of hearing the echoes of the Bologna process towards a common Iberoamerican knowledge area. We present and analyze the initiatives towards this end (intergovernmental Declarations, Meetings of University Presidents and collaborative projects among universities in Latin American and the European Union, etc.), initiatives that express a commitment to advance towards the construction of common space for higher education. We conclude that although Bologna represents an unattainable horizon for Latin America, it nevertheless creates a space for critical reflection which allows Latin American higher education to ascertain its own limitations and possibilities.","Univ Diego Portales, Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile",,"Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Ejercito 333, Santiago, Chile.",josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021",,,,,47,10,19,1,11,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

On the other hand, the most frequent ontological error found is the presentation of energy as an object. Finally, it is concluded that there are ontologically ambiguous verbs that can generate confusions in the meaning of energy and that a large part of ontological and syntax errors is due the absence of a material reference within a sentence.","[Fernanda Guajardo, Maria; Quiroz, Waldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Guajardo, MF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Valparaiso, Chile.",mguajardocastro17@gmail.com; waldo.quiroz@pucv.cl,,,,,,35,0,0,1,1,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0212-4521,2174-6486,,ENSEN CIENC,Ensen.

Recent history makes a historical analysis of social reality and a historiographical analysis of the immediate. It is located between history and present, between past and present, between witness and historian, between memory and history. This situation creates problems in teaching. This article investigates the teaching-learning process of the subunit 'Military regime and transition to democracy' in secondary schools in Santiago, Chile, by means of both a quantitative methodological strategy to identify six unique cases, and a qualitative strategy that is reported in this article. A variety of practices highlighted four models: constructivism, development of meta-cognition, historical discourse, and moral discourse. These models are described. Their diversity is due to the existence of different theoretical frameworks. This unit has gaps in content and historiographical knowledge, and there is no coordination with human rights education. The diversity of models is cause for concern because not all of them encourage students to understand the present as a result of a historical process and how to operate within it.","[Isabel Toledo, Maria; Gazmuri, Renato] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Magendzo, Abraham] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile",,"Toledo, MI (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Santiago Ctr, Vergara 275, Santiago, Chile.",maria.toledo@udp.cl; abrahammagendzo@gmail.com; renatojuanjose.gazmuri@campus.uab.cat,,,,,,26,0,2,0,12,"UNIV PRETORIA, FAC EDUCATION",PRETORIA,"UNIV PRETORIA, FAC EDUCATION, PRETORIA, 00001, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-2236,,,PERSPECT EDUC,Perspect.

Furthermore, it explores the neutrality of the content taught; the ideological standpoints of the teachers and the students; emotions that emerge; relationships with the victims and so on. These tensions were noted during research undertaken in secondary schools in Santiago, Chile, in 2007. Introducing recent history into curriculum content is a way to teach citizenship education since it enables students to understand how historical processes occur and influence the present and permits understanding of the social context and everyday reality. However, when what is taught from recent history is an account of the violation of human rights, teaching becomes much more difficult and complex and several moral problems arise because of the proximity of the events, diverse interpretations of the facts and the different levels and ways of involvement of the teachers and students.","[Magendzo, Abraham] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Doctorate Program Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Isabel Toledo, Maria] Univ Diego Portales, Sch Psychol, Fac Human Sci & Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Magendzo, A (corresponding author), Camino Bodega 7173,CP 7660200 Vitacura, Santiago, Chile.",abrahammagendzo@gmail.com,,,,,,19,13,19,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0305-7240,,,J MORAL EDUC,J.

Therefore, it is timely to examine teacher educators from different fields of expertise to offer a more specific and subject-related understanding of their professional learning involvement. This study investigates the initiatives that Chilean university-based ESOL teacher educators engage in to continue learning and their perceived professional learning needs. Data are drawn from a national web-based survey and a focus group. The results suggest that individual formal learning opportunities that are highly valued, and sometimes prescribed, by higher education institutions are predominant. Their professional learning needs, however, relate mainly to promoting collaborative peer-learning, advancing knowledge about diversity in the classroom and technology literacy, and enhancing their research skills and practice in language teaching. This study highlights the importance of identifying these needs as a foundation to design learning opportunities that meet the demands of the profession and the particularities of each discipline.

However, despite four decades of research suggesting that dialogical interactions promote student learning, it has been very difficult to reflect this in practice. Teachers' professional development programmes oriented towards promoting dialogical pedagogies have been based on sociocultural approaches centred on teachers' reflective analysis of classroom practices. Studies show that reflecting on pedagogical practices is necessary but insufficient to promote the desired changes. Beyond reflection, initiatives centred on scaffolding the practice with dialogic discursive repertoires have seen more successful results. This suggests that centring on the practice seems to be fundamental to change. Nevertheless, the theoretical basis has not been elaborated further to understand why centring on the direct scaffolding of practice would promote teachers' learning and pedagogical practice transformation. In order to account for the available empirical evidence, drawing on the works of Bakhtin and Vygotsky, the aim of this paper is to elaborate on a dialogical theory of teacher learning. Using this theoretical approach, different theoretical views of learning, teacher professional development programmes and the main tensions therein are discussed.","[Guzman, Valentina; Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman, V (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",vaguzman@uahurtado.cl,,"Guzman Fernandez, Valentina Sonia/0000-0001-6164-0843",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170431],This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [GRANT NUMBER:1170431].,,54,0,0,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1941-5257,1941-5265,,PROF DEV EDUC,Prof. Dev.

It analyzes how these particular usages were crossed by affective intensities that worked to produce students' political subjectivities as collective and agentic. This affective work was produced with other members of the school community and sometimes was met with anger, policing practices, and desires to exclude students from particular historical narratives. The data for this article were produced within a yearlong critical ethnographic study on the processes of production of high school feminist students' gender and political subjectivities in Chile, which included participant observation, testimonios interviews, art-based collective testimonios workshops, and analysis through affect theory. The findings show the types of historical and political narratives and symbols used by students, what affective intensities that crossed these symbols did to the students' political subjectivities, and the conflicts these intensities produced within the school community.

Given the relevance of principal succession for leadership quality and school improvement, there has been a lack of research in recent decades that has synthesized principal succession. This study aims to review the literature from 2003 to 2019 on principal succession in schools. Using a systematic review as the methodological approach, the eight core educational management and administration leadership journals were selected to collect the sources. Among this corpus of data, four main topics emerged: (a) factors affecting principal succession; (b) the dilemma between change and continuity; (c) the impact of principal succession on teachers; and (d) the evaluation of succession programs. We found that the volume of evidence on principal succession in K-12 schools is low and narrow, even with the importance of the topic. Given the increasingly common pattern of principal movements across the school system, it is urgent to research principal succession in greater detail. Otherwise, the association between principal succession and school failure will be maintained.","[Aravena, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Educ Leadership, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Aravena, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",felipe.aravena@pucv.cl,,,,,,38,2,2,10,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

This study presents the experience of action-research included in a teacher professional development program focused on improving pedagogical interaction from a sociocultural perspective. From 2012 to 2015, three cohorts of early childhood teachers from nursery schools located in vulnerable contexts participated in this program. These teachers developed intervention plans according to the action-research framework. In this report, these plans are analysed through a qualitative content analysis. Reports made by the participants and interviews with three tutors are also analysed. The results of the intervention plans show that most of them are focused on teacher professional development using video supported reflection to enhance the quality of interaction with children. In the reports, teachers identified important improvements in their skills, knowledge, beliefs and practices, and developed critical reflection on the process. Tutors found some problems during the program, which took them into a reflection process that led to transformations in their practice. These results are discussed in the context of a neoliberal society that might interfere with the development of alternative programs.","[Guerra, Paula; Figueroa, Ignacio] Univ Diego Portales, Cognit Dev Ctr, Santiago, Chile",,"Guerra, P (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Cognit Dev Ctr, Santiago, Chile.",paula.guerra@mail.udp.cl,"Figueroa-CŽspedes, Ignacio/B-5316-2019","Figueroa-CŽspedes, Ignacio/0000-0002-2756-1831; guerra, paula/0000-0001-8180-3101",,,,43,0,0,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0957-5146,1472-4421,,EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON,Early Years,,2018,38,4,,,,,396,410,,10.1080/09575146.2017.1288088,,,15,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,HF3SR,WOS:000454155300007,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,early years,Q4

In engineering, there have been numerous initiatives to implement REL over recent years, given the fundamental role of laboratory activities. However, in the past efforts have concentrated on laboratory groups interacting face to face, disregarding the capacities of distributed student collaborative environments. This article proposes a model for the implementation of REL in a distributed collaborative scenario, focusing on two crucial key elements: shared knowledge and interaction for collaboration. The model focuses on the methodological aspects of executing REL in a distributed collaborative scenario and disregards technical aspects of the implementation. This study analyses distributed collaborative scenarios where the teacher plays a fundamental role in REL configuration to ensure group collaboration. The new model introduced presents diverse aspects that are associated with the methodological implementation of REL in the field of engineering; hence it is to be regarded as a foundation for teachers developing REL in distributed collaborative scenarios.","[Herrera, Oriel A.] Univ Catolica Temuco, Informat Engn Sch, Temuco, Chile; [Fuller, David A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Herrera, OA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Informat Engn Sch, Temuco, Chile.",oherrera@inf.uct.cl; dfuller@ing.puc.cl,,,,,,32,11,11,0,3,AUSTRALASIAN SOC COMPUTERS LEARNING TERTIARY EDUCATION-ASCILITE,TUGUN,"UNIT 5, 202 COODE ST, PO BOX 350, TUGUN, 4224, AUSTRALIA",1449-3098,1449-5554,,AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC,Australas.

Therefore, in order to develop and implement successful methodologies in the classroom aiming to improve students' scientific literacy, it seems crucial to know what exactly science is. However, defining science turns out to be a complex problem inside the philosophy of science, and it has even been claimed that science cannot be defined. There are several strategies to face this problem in science education. Here, we show that most of the current strategies are lists of features trying to capture the nature of science, and we also show that the kind of strategies based on lists of features have insurmountable problems. We recognise the strengths and weaknesses of two main approaches, and building from those lessons we create a tool guiding the exploration of science nature which is free of the problems identified in previous approaches.","[Romero-Maltrana, Diego; Duarte, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Romero-Maltrana, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",diego.romero@pucv.cl,,,,,,43,2,2,6,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0157-244X,1573-1898,,RES SCI EDUC,Res.

The reasons are to be found in the continent's historic and modern institutional patterns. Latin American governments increasingly limit their interventions to funding and rely on the free play of the forces of supply and demand, institutional and corporate interests, and negotiated rules of the game to coordinate their systems. Moreover, Latin America's dynamic tertiary education systems face structural, organizational, and functional obstacles that often discourage international convergence. However, Bologna is stimulating closer university collaboration between Latin American and European institutions, particularly Spanish and Portuguese universities, in an effort to create an Ibero-American area of knowledge, with student and faculty exchanges. Thus Bologna has had an indirect stimulus by encouraging collaboration, and concomitant issues such as Latin America's current debate about curricular reform and higher education competitiveness.","Univ Diego Portales, Francisco Chacon Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile",,"Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Francisco Chacon Inst Invest Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile.",josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021","Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237",,,,45,18,19,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1028-3153,1552-7808,,J STUD INT EDUC,J.

For this purpose, a mixed-methods research was carried out, applying a questionnaire to more than 7000 Chilean students aged 12 to 18 years, and interviews with 14 specialists in the field of education. The study yielded three main results: firstly, it showed that parental mediation at home has a much greater impact -on the use of technologies and academic performance- than mediation carried out in schools. Secondly, it was observed that students who use YouTube as a study tool have a lower school performance than students who use their notebook notes. Thirdly, we identified difficulties and challenges in the implementation of ICT in the classroom. Thus, this work acquires special relevance by contributing to how to influence the practices of ICT use in an educational system that has had to adapt to the online modality.","[Halpern, Daniel; Pina, Martina; Ortega-Gunckel, Constanza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile",,"Halpern, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile.",dmhalper@uc.cl; mipina@uc.cl; cortega1@uc.cl,,,,,,39,0,0,7,9,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

In this article, we conceptualize reading mediation as a 'technology of affect'. We propose 'mediation-as-usual', a normative becoming of this technology, tasked with producing categories and identities regarding readers. Within this technology, adults are produced as empathetic, caring, and providers of safe spaces for reading. We report on literary encounters at a school in Santiago, Chile, with a 'challenging' picturebook. We were involved in the emergence of what we term 'abject mediation', a figuration that produces the limits and boundaries of mediation-as-usual, and, we argue, has transformative potential. However, this is an ephemeral figuration, as reterritorialization works to assimilate the border elements, actualizing mediation-as-usual. We discuss how these figurations may help to question normative ways of producing readers.","[Veliz, Soledad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies, Santiago, Chile",,"Veliz, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",sdveliz@uc.cl,,"Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena/0000-0001-8051-9969","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FONDECYT 11800700, PIA 160007, SOC 180023, CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21160817]","This work was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica: [grant numbers FONDECYT 11800700, PIA 160007, SOC 180023 and CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21160817].",,71,2,3,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0159-6306,1469-3739,,DISCOURSE-ABINGDON,Discourse,JAN 2,2022,43,1,,,,,15,29,,10.1080/01596306.2020.1786355,,JUL 2020,15,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,YW1NZ,WOS:000547144200001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,discourse-studies in the cultural politics of education,Q2

Drawing both on motivation theories and on concepts related to teacher cognition, autonomy and agency, the analysis of 19 semi-structured interviews with Chilean English teachers sheds light on the difficulties that many teachers have in motivating their students so that they engage in classroom activities and learning. Findings show that teachers with a developed sense of agency report higher levels of learner motivation. Salient features of their accounts are classroom practices that grant students immediate positive experiences while learning English, rather than referring to future benefits. Other features are autonomous learning tasks, and a context-appropriate, empowering selection of cultural contents. The discussion suggests that teachers need to develop a sound sense of agency to identify spaces to manoeuvre' between external constraints, such as curricular policies or lack of parental support, and possible internal constraints, such as paralysing beliefs about their own competence or a limited cultural repertoire to draw on in order to make English lessons motivating and meaningful for their students. For improved learner motivation and meaningful learning, research needs to support teachers' autonomy in times of increasing curricular regulation and standardisation of knowledge.","[Glas, Katharina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Ave El Bosque 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile",,"Glas, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Ave El Bosque 1290, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",katharina.glas@ucv.cl,,"Glas, Katharina/0000-0002-8214-1725",,,,37,4,5,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-1522,1470-1146,,RES PAP EDUC,Res.

Leading exponents do not agree on its definition and include the two main traditions: Anglo-American and German, and various groups or research centres throughout the Western world. Something problematic happens with the models of progression or development of historical thinking that lack an agreed upon psychological theory as their foundation. We argue that theoretical differences are produced by the split between the psychological, considered individually, and the social, considered external to individual thought. In this article we propose that researchers of the development of historical thinking can benefit from a re-reading of Vygotskian theory, with a focus on everyday concepts, scientific concepts and zones of proximal development. In this paper, we carry out a conceptual systemization of historical thinking based on this literature. We distinguish several dimensions that we group into three 'macro-dimensions' according to their psychological dynamics of development, which is dialectically related with history education and the socio-historical conditions surrounding it. These macro-dimensions explain the developmental rhythms of historical thinking and include the disciplinary knowledge macro-dimension, the epistemological macro-dimension, and the ethical-political macro-dimension.","[Albornoz Munoz, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Sebastian Balmaceda, Christian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Munoz, NA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",noalbornoz@uc.cl,,"SEBASTIAN BALMACEDA, Christian Luis/0000-0001-5038-9227; Albornoz, Natalia/0000-0003-3915-2442",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21170619],This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [Beca Doctorado Nacional 21170619].,,70,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0272,1366-5839,,J CURRICULUM STUD,J.

In order to report on the progress of our work, we present a discourse analysis of three experiences considered to be of particular relevance by a final-year pedagogy student. The analysis yielded four important conclusions: i) The process of teachers' professional identity construction is based on comparing and contrasting different experiences and culminates in the construction of new identity positions; ii) this process must involve experiences that call into question existing meanings of self; iii) future teachers must engage in productive dialogue with other significant actors in order to identify and recognise the value of certain positional objects; and iv) certain subjective learning experiences have a greater impact on the reconstruction of identity positions. Finally, we propose an analysis model based on subjective learning experiences for the construction of teachers' professional identity.","[Chavez Rojas, Jorge] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Edificio Bellavista 121, Providencia Santiago, Chile; [Faure Ninoles, Jaime] Univ Andres Bello, Dept Educ, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Barril Madrid, Juan Pablo] Univ Autonoma Chile, Dept Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Rojas, JC (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Edificio Bellavista 121, Providencia Santiago, Chile.",jorge.chavez@unab.cl,,"Chavez, jorge/0000-0001-7603-4766","Center for Youth Studies UNAB (CEJ-UNAB) [P2019.4]; PIED (Educational research projects) from the Pro-Vice-Chancellor's Office (Research), Faculty of Education, Universidad Andres Bello [DI-PIED3/2018]","This work was supported by the Center for Youth Studies UNAB (CEJ-UNAB) [P2019.4]; PIED (Educational research projects) from the Pro-Vice-Chancellor's Office (Research), Faculty of Education, Universidad Andres Bello [DI-PIED3/2018].",,103,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0261-9768,1469-5928,,EUR J TEACH EDUC,Eur.

While second language acquisition tasks have been taken online, the traditional language laboratory has remained unchanged. By continuing to follow its original configuration based on individual work, the language laboratory fails to take advantage of the potential provided by collaborative learning. We propose the use of a language laboratory based on single-display groupware (SDG) for learning vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and listening comprehension. By adopting SDG, the language laboratory benefits from the advantages of small group collaborative learning. In this paper, we first describe the design and pedagogical merit of the SDG collaborative language laboratory. We then share the results of a quasi-experimental pre-post comparison study, and use an observation guideline to analyze whether the conditions for collaborative learning have been fulfilled. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that developing pronunciation skills can be more effective when using a collaborative language laboratory versus an individual language laboratory. In addition to this, it can also be concluded that collaborative learning is most effective when accompanied by adequate instructional design.","[Felipe Calderon, Juan; Nussbaum, Miguel; Carmach, Ignacio; Jaime Diaz, Juan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santigo, Chile; [Villalta, Marco] Univ Santiago Chile, Sch Humanities, Santigo, Chile",,"Calderon, JF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santigo, Chile.",jfcalder@ing.puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Villalta, Marco/B-9555-2012","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Villalta, Marco/0000-0002-7553-925X","Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [CIE01-CONICYT]","This work was supported by Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [Grant CIE01-CONICYT].",,72,2,2,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1049-4820,1744-5191,,INTERACT LEARN ENVIR,Interact.

This study employed a phenomenographic approach to investigate what university teachers think eLearning is good for in their teaching. Four qualitatively different ways of conceiving of eLearning were discovered: (a) to provide information to students; (b) for occasional communication among unit participants; (c) to engage students in online discussions; and (d) to support knowledge-building tasks. Four dimensions of variation provided a more detailed picture. These were: role of teacher, role of students, unit participants' interaction and perception of embeddedness with face-to-face component. Results are situated in line with those from previous research and indicate an emerging consensus of findings. Academic developers may benefit from these outcomes by using them in designing eLearning support programs. Further studies confirming or challenging previous findings, as well as associating conceptions of eLearning and teaching, are proposed.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Gonzalez, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",cgonzalu@uc.cl,"Gonz‡lez, Carlos/D-7228-2017","Gonz‡lez, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777",,,,36,61,61,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

Design/methodology/approach To this end, we analyzed teaching interventions in two kindergarten lessons focused on the playful task of tossing two coins, associated with inferential statistical reasoning. The study highlights the importance of arguing and promoting this reasoning to develop statistical thinking. It is crucial to recognize how early students can be subject to learning experiences that promote a language of uncertainty, assess the evidence provided by the data, and make generalizations. Findings The results reveal that while the educator demonstrated knowledge and skills relevant to the curriculum and conceptual teaching strategies, the understanding of the content by the students and the integration of the PCK components still present a challenge. Practical implications The lesson study collaborative teaching practices that promote PCK have proven effective for informing the design and implementation of instructional practices supporting the development of early statistical thinking in young children. Originality/value The study enriches the knowledge regarding the potential of the lesson study (LS) in the professional learning of kindergarten educators. It also contributes to a comprehensive approach based on authentic playful experiences in grade K that supports the development of early statistical thinking in young children.","[Estrella, Soledad; Olfos, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Math, Valparaiso, Chile; [Mendez-Reina, Maritza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Aguilera, Jocelyn] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Math, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Olfos, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Math, Valparaiso, Chile.",raimundo.olfos@pucv.cl,"Estrella, Soledad/AFV-7046-2022","estrella, soledad/0000-0002-4567-2914",ANID Fondecyt [1200346]; FONDEF [20i10070]; VRIEA PUCV [039.439/2020]; ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; National Doctorate Scholarship ANID [21210862],Support from ANID Fondecyt 1200346; FONDEF ID 20i10070; VRIEA PUCV 039.439/2020; National Doctorate Scholarship ANID 21210862; and ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003 are gratefully acknowledged.,,42,0,0,3,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2046-8253,2016-8261,,INT J LESSON LEARN S,Int.

Biasing factors studies are an influential source of evidence for arguing about biased teaching evaluations. These studies examine existing evaluation data and compare the results by gender, race, or ethnicity, interpreting a significant difference between subgroups as evidence of bias. However, only a difference explained by irrelevant aspects embedded in the evaluation would compromise its fairness. The study aims to amend how practitioners and researchers address gender bias concerns in faculty teaching evaluations by defining fairness, disparate impact, and statistical bias from an educational measurement standpoint. The study illustrates the use of differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, a strategy to examine whether the meaning of an item changes depending on the gender of the instructor. The study examines instructor's gender bias using responses to a course evaluation questionnaire from education graduate students from two academic departments within the same institution. In one of the departments, the analysis suggested a fair evaluation and no gender gap. In the other department, four of the eight items in the rating scale were easier for women than men with similar teaching ability, and women achieved better evaluations than men. The discussion addresses the conceptual and methodological advantages of adopting an educational measurement perspective on fairness in faculty teaching evaluation. Findings encourage practitioners and administrators to use the best available tools to strengthen the credibility of faculty teaching evaluations and prevent unfair personnel decisions affecting underrepresented subgroups in academia by gender, race, or ethnicity.","[Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Valencia, E (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",envalenc@uc.cl,,,,,,74,2,2,7,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

To test their functionality as a platform for collaborative educational activities, the authors adapted an existing Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) application for use on cell phones equipped with Wi-Fi. This article examines the problems of developing applications for this alternative technology and reports on a usability analysis of a collaborative classroom activity for teaching physics. The results confirm the viability of the cell phone platform, taking due account of the device's processing, network and interface limitations.

Being able to engage digital information abilities to solve an information interaction activity within digital environments is key for social participation, equality and for bridging socio-economic and cultural gaps. Developing these abilities within school classrooms has become a priority. However, research suggest that a majority of students can only complete basic and explicit information-gathering and management tasks within digital environments. Literature constantly holds that students' expressed experiences of information interaction activities are key for developing digital information abilities. Notwithstanding, there are still important gaps within our understanding of students' expressed experiences of them. To address such gaps we employ phenomenography to study Chile's Secondary Technical and Vocational Education and Training students' expressed experiences of information interaction abilities; a group that has likewise been overlooked. By means of purposeful sampling, a total of 24 students participated in the study. Focusing on both the out-of and in-school settings, findings suggest that the apparent clear-cut division between the out-of and in-school experiencing seems not to be as pristine as some might suggest. Findings also indicate that specialty courses, as they are currently designed, might not be favorable for developing digital information abilities as well as pointing towards the importance of situating students' expressed experiences within wider discourses surrounding digital ability development.","[Bolanos, Fernando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Doctorate Program, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile; [Salinas, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile",,"Bolanos, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Doctorate Program, Fac Educ, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago 340, Chile.",fbolnaos@uc.cl,"Bolanos, Fernando/F-3805-2017","Bolanos, Fernando/0000-0003-0873-6672",Pontifical Catholic University of Chile's Vice-Rectorship for Research,This work was supported by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile's Vice-Rectorship for Research who provides scholarships to doctoral students of the University.,,60,1,1,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

Using a poststructural theoretical perspective, the qualitative study is focused on rural students' subjectivities, through the analysis of their narratives about their lives, their perceptions on secondary schooling, and their educational/labour perspectives about the future. The findings reveal the tensions between the certainty and uncertainty of a future. Specifically, of an educational and work path by which students seek to continue or diverge from the paths taken by previous generations. Here, education policies fail to offer a real upgrade in their future educational and lived conditions or aspirations.

The analysis is based on the concept of school trust, emphasizing Bryk and Tschannen-Moran's classic works. A mixed sequential quantitative-qualitative research methodology is used, including both a survey and a qualitative case study carried out in nine schools. The main results, include: principals and teachers take a different approach when forging trust they have in one another. While principals confer this trust, teachers earn it. Likewise, principals mainly set the tone, intensity and scope of the trust relationship; principals are more critical of teachers, mainly questioning certain aspects of their professional skills. Conversely, teachers normally base trust on more personal matters; individual traits of both principals and teachers have little impact on their relational trust, the exception being the number of years teachers have been on the job. While for teachers there are hardly any differences (and this changes only when it comes to the prevailing principal's leadership), among principals, differences emerge from schools' size, socio-economic level and public or private status; and a final discussion propounds the importance of the educational context when analysing trust relationships and positional power in schools.","[Weinstein, Jose; Pena, Javiera] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Weinstein, Jose] CEDLE, Santiago, Chile; [Raczynski, Dagmar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Vergara 249,Tercer Piso, Santiago Ctr, Chile.",jose.weinstein@gmail.com,,,FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150526],The authors would like to acknowledge the support of FONDECYT (project number 1150526) and CEDLE.,,64,5,5,3,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

J,"Bernasconi, A",,,,"Bernasconi, Andres",,,Constitutional prospects for the implementation of funding and governance reforms in Latin American higher education,journal of education policy,,,English,Article,,,,,,,QUALITY-ASSURANCE; WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; POLICY; ENVIRONMENT; ECONOMY; SYSTEMS,"The rationale for comprehensive reform of Latin American higher education crystallized in the mid 1990s in policy documents published by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. This 'Washington consensus' of the multilateral banks advocated, among other measures, greater reliance on private sources of funding, increased accountability, and a more effective management and governance structure for public universities in the region. A decade later, these prescriptions not only remain current, but have been somewhat bolstered by policy developments consistent with them in Europe, Asia and Australia. This article compares this reform agenda for funding and governance with the norms on higher education finance and control written in the current constitutions of the Latin American nations. Its purpose is to assess, from a juridical point of view, the viability of the policy prescriptions of that reform agenda for higher education. Major constitutional obstacles to cost recovery via tuition fees are provisions establishing the right to a free higher education in the public sector, while as to the matter of governance, in many countries in the region, the government is not constitutionally authorized to modify by mandate the governance structure of universities, which can only be defined by the institutions themselves.","Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile",,"Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Av Republ 330, Santiago, Chile.",abernasconi@unab.cl,"Bernasconi, AndrŽs/I-9041-2012","Bernasconi, AndrŽs/0000-0001-8008-3747",,,,52,4,5,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0268-0939,,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

Through a critical and diffractive reading of these documents with Ahmed's (2004, 2010) and Braidotti's (2018) conceptualizations of the affective, we claim that when reading is presented as beneficial, pleasurable, and promising, an assemblage of exclusion is set into motion. We describe how the affective repertoires in these documents reinforce oppressive and exclusionary neoliberal values under the guise of the promise of future happiness. The pleasure and happiness that can be achieved through literary reading, however, is only accessible to those who are willing to orientate themselves in the right ways. In this orientation, the cognitive is privileged over the emotional, and readers are supposed to learn to postpone any current demands for the promise of future happiness.","[Errazuriz, Valentina; Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Errazuriz, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",ve2147@tc.columbia.edu; mgarciay@uc.cl,,"Garcia-Gonzalez, Macarena/0000-0001-8051-9969; Errazuriz, Valentina/0000-0003-0914-1021",,,,48,1,1,4,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0362-6784,1467-873X,,CURRICULUM INQ,Curric.

Method: Participants were 23 childcare providers (nine teachers and 14 childcare technicians) who were evaluated with an average of three children each at one time. Stress associated to caregiving practices was assessed using the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), and caregiver sensitivity was measuring using the Child-Adult Relationship Experimental Index Toddlers (CARE-index). Results: No association was found between global level of stress and caregiver sensitivity. However, there was a significant association between the caregiver-child dysfunctional interaction subscale and caregiver sensitivity, specifically with the cognitive aspects of sensitive response and when a caregiver was nonresponsive. Furthermore, the 'Difficult Child' PSI subscale was associated with the cognitive aspects of the caregiver ' s sensitive response. Conclusions: These findings support the relevance of children's early interactions with their non-parental caregivers and demonstrate how daily stress can affect the cognitive aspects of the caregivers' sensitive response to the infants' needs.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Santelices, MP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile.",msanteli@uc.cl,,"Santelices, Maria-Pia/0000-0001-7473-1525",,,,47,2,2,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-293X,1752-1807,,EUR EARLY CHILD EDUC,Eur.

The ample literature on this topic reflects the debate about the contemporary role of this type of university. The present article describes the core models of these narratives, simply put as Humboldtian and Napoleonic, with their different evolutions and expressions in various contemporary higher education environments. The discussion shows that the ((idea of the public or state university, developed by these narratives, is quite dramatically different in the present day. Today the public university lacks a narrative, an explanation of itself, and a sense of how to account for new organizational forms and practices of knowledge production, transmission and management. Given these antecedents, the article makes proposals to refresh the practical discourse of public/state universities in Latin America and examines the possibility of a critical-deliberative model for both public and private universities.","UDP, CPCE, Santiago 8370056, Chile",,"Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), UDP, CPCE, Ejercito 260, Santiago 8370056, Chile.",josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021",,,,,33,14,16,1,17,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

Critics contend that vouchers increase the risk of stratification. Researchers have found that Chile's voucher program has lead to increased socioeconomic school segregation. What has been overlooked, however, is segregation between schools within a sector and variation within private for-profit and non-profit school sectors. I find that public schools are more likely to serve disadvantaged students than private voucher schools. I also find that disadvantaged students are more segregated among private voucher schools than among public schools. While between and within sector segregation levels vary across private voucher school types, the differences are not always consistent with theory. The data also suggest that policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the stratifying effects of educational vouchers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of creative thinking the results show no evidence for the Beta group, while the more positive results came from those not attending the program. However in both groups this type of thinking is underdeveloped.

To complete this study, I conducted 13 in-depth interviews and a focus group with five Chilean graduate international students who enrolled in an elite research university in the Northeastern region of the United States. The data raised questions about how social class is negotiated in both education and space, challenging how we understand the relationship between social class and education in a global context. I argue that through a process of international mobility, upper-class students from Chile lose class privilege, which in turn influences them to denaturalise their class constructions. Based on discussion of social class within the sociology of education and insights from whiteness studies, the results of my study enable a dialogue about how mobility affects individuals within an international context. I conclude that while international mobility demands students to rethink their class constructions, the affective disruption of silence and guilt emerge as two strategies to justify and perpetuate social class privilege.","[Munoz-Garcia, Ana Luisa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Munoz-Garcia, AL (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",aumunoz@uc.cl,,,,,,54,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0159-6306,1469-3739,,DISCOURSE-ABINGDON,Discourse,JAN 2,2021,42,1,,,SI,,102,113,,10.1080/01596306.2020.1855566,,DEC 2020,12,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,QP2EI,WOS:000596981500001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,discourse-studies in the cultural politics of education,Q2

Two related entrepreneurial technologies of the self, namely, managerial leadership and ontological coaching, were identified. They were part of a regime of neoliberal subjectification unfolded in the mandatory modules to harness the working-class students' affective entrepreneurial vitalities as both the true ontology of their selves and the desirable features that make them the legitimate and responsible subjects of right to higher education.","[Leyton, Daniel] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Leyton, D (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile.",dleyton@uahurtado.cl,"Leyton, Daniel/ABF-3998-2020","Leyton, Daniel/0000-0003-2472-9835",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica,This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica.,,82,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

Twenty Chilean secondary education Social Studies teachers were invited to participate in a group interview and workshop to establish their conceptions of controversial issues and to design lesson plans for teaching such issues. The data showed that although teachers recognise some of the key elements that define these issues and recognise their pedagogical potential, they do not link them with learning the characteristics of social conflict and do not seek to deepen students' understanding of the actors and interests involved in such issues. The data reveal a tension between transmitting to students an interpretation of the traumatic issue in question and creating the conditions for students to analyse the different interpretations that may be in conflict.

We are subjects of a particular history, a succession of events and narratives, located in time, space and circumstances. I constructed myself, consciously or unconsciously, as a human rights educator as a consequence of many personal factors. Being the son of the first Rabbi in Chile, I felt, at a very early age, that I was different and suffered from discriminatory behaviour, prejudice and intolerance. In addition, I started to learn about the Holocaust. I lived in a poor neighbourhood and poverty had a profound impact on me. During the 1960s and 1970s many political changes took place in Chile. Severe human rights violations occurred, not only in Chile but also in the different contexts of many other Latin American countries.

Researchers also agree that attendance has a positive effect on learning; however, there are few empirical studies that measure the nature and significance of that effect. The authors analyzed the effect of class attendance on academic performance and evaluated the existence and importance of a minimum attendance requirement. Using student data from a sample of public primary schools in Chile, and considering for endogeneity and sample selection bias, they found two important results. First, attendance had a relevant and statistically significant effect on educational performance. Second, the existence of a threshold was identified, but educational performance did not continue to decrease after a certain number of absences, which seems to contradict policies that have a minimum attendance requirement.","[Paredes, Ricardo D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Paredes, RD (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013","Paredes, Ricardo D/0000-0002-4081-1700",,,,39,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0671,1940-0675,,J EDUC RES,J.

This commitment becomes evident in the policies and legislation promoting inclusion and sanctioning violence in Chilean schools. The present empirical study analyses semi-structured interviews with teachers working in the Chilean southern regions Los Lagos and Los Rios, with the purpose of providing a description of teachers' practices when handling peer-to-peer violence. The evidence was qualitatively scrutinised so as to portray possible inclusive values in teachers' approaches to deal with violence among students in their work places. The results of this study disclose several inclusive values present in educators' practices, which suggests an intention to promote safety and inclusion for everyone. Notwithstanding the apparent teachers' efforts to provide their students with safe and inclusive establishments, the Chilean education system might need to strengthen the links among social services, schools and families. Therefore, having teachers whose practices show inclusive morals does not seem enough to ensure safe and inclusive schools, but rather complements the collaborative work that appears necessary among the different actors of the education system.","[Soto Torres, Yesenia] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Inst Linguist & Literatura, Valdivia, Chile; [Soto Torres, Yesenia] Santa Pilar 780, Valdivia 5091280, Chile",,"Torres, YS (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Linguist & Literatura, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.",yesenia.soto.t@gmail.com,,,Chilean Ministry of Education through the Advanced Human Capital Programme of the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [73160734],"This work was supported by the Chilean Ministry of Education through the Advanced Human Capital Programme of the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), under [grant number 73160734].",,48,0,0,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-3116,1464-5173,,INT J INCLUSIVE EDUC,Int.

Using mixed methods research, we developed an instrument that identifies student interests. This instrument was applied in a pilot study that considered 10th-grade students from three schools in Santiago, Chile. We compared student interest and national curriculum for different factors and established how well aligned these are. The results reveal that private school students prefer subjects that require greater cognitive development, related to Young's powerful knowledge. Students from voucher schools, on the other hand, prefer to develop their knowledge of the arts and physical education, both of which are subjects they tend to enjoy. These findings are coherent with Bernstein's theories. This pattern is also repeated when comparing high-performing students with their low-performing counterparts, regardless of school type. The findings of this study not only help identify which subjects the students want to study, but also to understand the reasons behind their preferences. Understanding these reasons is key for developing a more contextualised curriculum that makes more sense to the students.","[Araneda, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Angelica Guzman, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Curriculum Technol & Evaluat Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile",,"Araneda, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",dnaraneda@uc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",,,,36,2,2,4,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

Grounded in Deleuzoguattarian assemblage theory, we map the multiplicities produced by the collision between social justice research practices and 'vulnerability' as a pervading category within the contemporary education policyscape. Analyzing a short film created by students labeled as 'at risk', we expose that educational policies aimed at addressing social vulnerability invent 'the future' as only habitable for those who materialize able-bodiedness. However, crip futurities also emerge throughout the short film, showing that non-normative expressions of the human can actualize themselves using research as a milieu. These simultaneous and asymmetrical ways of expressing humanness illuminate how intricate the affective relation between research and neoliberal policy is. We conclude by discussing the power of research-assemblages for disorienting ableist biopedagogies and legitimizing futures other than those of compulsory able-bodiedness.","[Araneda, Carlos; Infante, Marta] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Infante, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",minfantj@uc.cl,,"Araneda-Urrutia, Carlos/0000-0003-0962-3960",Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development under grant Fondecyt [1130616],"This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development under grant Fondecyt, [No1130616].",,58,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-8487,1750-8495,,CRIT STUD EDUC,Crit.

A bias may increase or decrease scores and change the relationship with other variables. In contrast, SET literature defines bias as an irrelevant variable correlated with SET scores, and among many, a relevant biasing factor in literature is the instructor's gender. The study examines the extent to which acquiescence, the tendency to endorse the highest response option across items and bias in the first sense affects students' responses to a SET rating scale. The study also explores how acquiescence affects the difference in teaching quality (TQ) by instructor's gender, a bias in the latter sense. SET data collected at a faculty of education in Ontario, Canada were analysed using the Rasch rating scale model. Findings provide empirical support for acquiescence affecting students' responses. Latent regression analyses show how acquiescence reduces the difference in TQ by instructor's gender. Findings encourage greater attention to the response process quality as a way to better defend the utility of SET and prevent potentially misleading conclusions from the analysis of SET data.","[Valencia, Edgar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Valencia, E (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Medic MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.",envalenc@uc.cl,"Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019","Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272",,,,57,6,6,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0260-2938,1469-297X,,ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU,Assess.

The present study looks at two types of feedback designed for problem-solving in primary school: Knowledge of Results and Elaborated Feedback. A series of interactive problems was designed for tablets to cover a range of topics for fifth-grade mathematics. Through a quasi-experimental design, one group of students (n = 31) was provided with Elaborated Feedback, while another group (n = 33) was provided with Knowledge of Results. Feedback was given to the students as they worked on the interactive problems over 6 sessions. The effectiveness of both types of feedback was then measured using a pre- and post-test. Although Elaborated Feedback helped the students achieve better results during the sessions, the Knowledge of Results group scored higher on the post-test.

To isolate the effect of incorporating technology, the first of these groups did not work with technology. The second group worked with a collaborative script that was developed for use with a tablet, while the third group used the same technology with an integrated tool that explicitly allowed the students to build arguments. We conclude that having students reflect on their own processes and outcomes by arguing their point of view can lead to an improvement in learning, more so than the technology itself.","[Caceres, M.; Nussbaum, M.; Marroquin, M.; Gleisner, S.; Marquinez, J.

It highlights the connections between specific ideas of the educated subject, the family role presented in governmental educational policies in Chile, and the ways these ideas are linked to the subjectivities and communities which the market requires to function. My argument is that with different intensities, affect regulation has become a strategic component of a government that articulates the relation between 'right ways to behave at home' and 'school success'. As a result, affect makes conservative cultural dispositions look natural. I use discourse analysis to show how these policies use affect to control and monitor behaviors and personal relations, as well circulating cultural logics and ideological structures. I analyze one particular document to show how affect does not work through meanings per se; rather, it circulates productive ideas of families, students' behaviors, and social and cultural frames to organize a 'good life'.","[Matus, Claudia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Matus, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Coll Educ, Santiago, Chile.",cmatusc@uc.cl,"Matus, Claudia/A-6840-2017","Matus, Claudia/0000-0002-9180-8237","CONICYT (Chilean National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research); Proyecto Anillos en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades [SOC 1103]; Normalidad, Diferencia y Educacion","The writing of this article was supported by CONICYT (Chilean National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research), Proyecto Anillos en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades [SOC 1103], and Normalidad, Diferencia y Educacion (www.nde.cl).",,43,5,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0159-6306,1469-3739,,DISCOURSE-ABINGDON,Discourse,,2017,38,2,,,,,235,248,,10.1080/01596306.2015.1087678,,,14,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,EO6TD,WOS:000396824500007,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,discourse-studies in the cultural politics of education,Q2

Governance refers here to the manner in which these institutions are organized and internally operated -i.e., their authority and management structures and processes- and to their external relations with various stakeholders in order to ensure the higher educations aims. A hypothesis commonly found in specialized literature is used as a starting point: that successful university organizations are those able to modify their governance -that is, their institutional command and control structures and management, to adapt to the changing demands of their environment and the transformation of its basic structures. A basic typology of higher education governance regimes is offered -i.e., bureaucratic, collegial, of stakeholders and entrepreneurial-, and their change-producing forces and evolutionary trends are identified, as well as the displacements of their corresponding center of gravity both within and between regimes.To this end examples are drawn from the history of modern universities in developed countries, both in the so-called Humboldtian and Napoleonic traditions. Finally, changing university governance circumstances and their peculiarities in Latin America are discussed. We explore tensions between traditional values of university self-governance based on broad electoral participation and values pertaining to entrepreneurial management; also between values assigned to higher education as a public good and shortcomings attributed to the private production of higher education.","Univ Diego Portales, CPCE, Santiago 7510216, Chile",,"Brunner, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, CPCE, Hernando de Aguirre 731, Santiago 7510216, Chile.",josejoaquin.brunner@gmail.com,"BRUNNER, Jose Joaquin/AAJ-7000-2021","Brunner, Jose Joaquin/0000-0002-7832-0237",,,,47,31,34,2,32,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

Access to schooling was until recently at the heart of the debate, the degree of justice of the educational systems being measured by their capacity to enrol and retain the population. Attention is now concentrated on the strength of the cultural resources offered by schools and the effectiveness of provision. Learning is the priority of education policy. This article develops the theme of equity, examining the concept and describing a programme which focuses on improving the equity of the Chilean educational system. It is suggested that educational equity should no longer mean equality of access but equality of results. A just system therefore needs to concentrate on raising the quality of schools serving the poorest sectors of society. The Chilean ''900 Schools Programme'' is an example. Its aim was to raise levels of achievement by improving the learning of poor children from 1st to 4th grade in reading, writing and mathematics. To do so, it improved the school environment, textbooks and methodologies, and offered support to children outside school hours by the work of community monitors.",,,"GARCIAHUIDOBRO, JE (corresponding author), MINIST EDUC,MECE BASICA PROGRAMA,SATTIAGO,CHILE.",,,,,,,0,6,7,0,1,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0020-8566,,,INT REV EDUC,Int.

The results of the investigation show notable changes in the maintenance factors associated with the teachers' questions and feedback, the scaffolding provided for the students' reasoning and the modelling of high-level performance. In terms of the decline in the level of cognitive demand, the greatest changes were found in factors corresponding to the routinization of problematic aspects of the task and to problems in lesson management.

However, there are relatively few studies that help us understand when or why this method has a positive effect on students, so as to aid the design of a flipped class. In this study, an instrument for assessing the student learning experience in flipped courses is proposed and validated, comparing the results of their application over two semesters in a university-level programming class with three flipped sections (n = 151) and four conventional ones (n = 226). We found that with a similar score in terms of learning experience, the achievement in a flipped course is slightly higher than in a lecture-based course, F(1,108) = 4.20, p = 0.04, d = 0.19. A multiple regression analysis was conducted for the effect on achievement of GPA, level of challenge, feedback and enjoyment. By controlling for these factors, students in flipped classes achieved higher scores than students in lecture-based courses, beta = 0.1, t(370) = 2.4, p = 0.02. The expected improvement in achievement increases when features of the flipped classroom improve the student experience.

In Chile, research on teacher quality has predominantly relied on cross-sectional data, and largely focused on identifying teacher attributes related to teaching quality. Only have few studies addressed the problem of non-random assignment of students to teachers. This paper attempts to fill these gaps. On the basis of pseudo-longitudinal data for 2011 from the Education Quality Measurement System and teachers' administrative records, we employed value-added and fixed-effect models correcting for sorting-bias, to assess the overall contribution of teachers to student achievement and identify which teacher characteristics enhance teacher effectiveness. We find that teacher contribution to students' learning in mathematics and language is very significant. In addition, teaching experience has a significant non-linear impact on test scores in math but not in reading. Both junior and senior teachers are effective in the educational system.

Although there has been much interest in this relationship, and several empirical studies have been conducted, the mechanism through which dialogue promotes learning remains unclear. There is compelling evidence to show that group work argumentation prompts student concept gains, especially when tests are taken weeks, after group collaboration; in other words, there are delayed effects. There is no conclusive empirical evidence about the mechanism through which discussions lead to conceptual growth. Moreover, gains are not related to group outcomes or resolutions, showing that the internalization of negotiated meanings is unlikely to be responsible for gains.

Despite increases in access, course completion rates remain problematic in Chile. Students' expectations of higher education can play an important role in their decision-making, especially in terms of choices made about programme and institution. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand Chilean high school students' expectations of the benefits and costs involved in the transition process from secondary to postsecondary education. Also, it aimed to examine the factors that influence those expectations. Method: We used a qualitative design to collect information from 76 university-tracked high-school seniors through nine focus groups. All focus group data were double coded using a directed content analysis approach. Findings: The analysis indicated that students mentioned expectations of non-monetary benefits frequently, and in all focus groups. Though monetary benefits were not referred to directly, students identified them implicitly through non-monetary benefits. Expectations about costs were mentioned less often than were benefits. Conclusions: Our study highlights that the construction of expectations appeared chiefly influenced by the information obtained through family and peers. The findings from this study should help focus institutional and educational policymakers' efforts in supporting the decision-making process of students transitioning to higher education.","[Guzman, Pamela; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo; Santelices, Maria Veronica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Guzman, Pamela] Millennium Nucleus Student Experience Higher Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",paguzmans@uc.cl,"Guzman, Pamela/G-9461-2018; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo/G-9470-2018","Guzman, Pamela/0000-0003-3469-6440; Cifuentes Gomez, Gonzalo/0000-0002-9317-7483","Chile's Ministry of Science through project Millennium Nucleus, Student Experience in Higher Education in Chile: Expectations and Realities, Chile; Chile's Ministry of Science through project Informacion y Decisiones en la Trayectoria Tecnico Profesional [Fondecyt] [1211883]; Chile's Ministry of Science through project El Rol de la Informacion en la Toma de Decisiones de Alumnos en Transicion a la Educacion Superior [Fondecyt] [1160871]","This article was partially funded by Chile's Ministry of Science through projects.

However, there is not yet enough research about the role that multimodal texts play in scaffolding student reading comprehension of complex scientific processes, such as energy transfer. This study explored how verbal and visual resources (scaffolding level) and individual differences (reading skills) contribute to science reading comprehension. One-hundred and sixty Chilean fifth-graders were assessed on reading skills, vocabulary, and prior science knowledge. A counterbalanced design was used to test two groups: Group 1 reads a text with low multimodal scaffolding and Group 2 reads a text with high multimodal scaffolding. Level of text scaffolding was determined by (1) image function, (2) visual-verbal relations, (3) presence of an explicit explanatory structure, and (4) lexico-grammatical resources. General monomodal and multimodal science reading comprehension were assessed with multiple-choice tests. An ANCOVA analysis revealed non-significant differences between groups after controlling for prior knowledge, fluency, and vocabulary. Likewise, a two-factor ANCOVA analysis showed that the high-multimodal scaffolding text significantly boosted science reading comprehension for low-skilled comprehenders. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for pedagogy and research, aiming to foster multimodal literacy for learning in content areas.","[Meneses, Alejandra; Veliz, Soledad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Off 01, Santiago 7820436, RM, Chile; [Escobar, Jose-Pablo; Veliz, Soledad] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Ctr Desarrollo Tecnol Inclus, Santiago, Chile",,"Meneses, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Off 01, Santiago 7820436, RM, Chile.",amenesea@uc.cl,"Escobar, JosŽ-Pablo/AAB-3688-2021; ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020; Meneses, Alejandra/B-6000-2017","Escobar, JosŽ-Pablo/0000-0001-9749-0285;","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant VRI Interdisciplina 27/2013; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant Proyecto Basal de Centros de Investigacion Interdisciplinaria","This work was supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Vicerrectoria de Investigacion (VRI) under Grant VRI Interdisciplina 27/2013 and under Grant Proyecto Basal de Centros de Investigacion Interdisciplinaria.",,55,8,8,4,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

Using national test score data, it confirms the findings from previous literature that ethnic gaps in educational achievement exist, though they are small and to a large extent explained by family socioeconomic status. The results indicate that school composition with respect to the socioeconomic background and indigenous status of students matters for academic achievement. Controlling for the student's socioeconomic background, the ethnic composition of the school attended is associated with student achievement. In schools where the ethnic composition is higher than the national average, the test score disadvantage of indigenous students is larger, especially for those students whose parents both identify as indigenous.

Nonetheless, institutional initiatives to support writing processes are relatively recent and not necessarily research-grounded. This systematic literature review aims to address this gap by answering the questions: What obstacles and facilitators in the writing process do doctoral students encounter in the areas of SS&H? And what clues do these offer about students' needs for institutional support? To do so, we focus on empirical student-centred research. Systematizing the evidence may strengthen pedagogical decisions and programmatic orientations focused on the students' experiences and writing processes. We analysed a total of 38 studies on these topics collected from mainstream databases and identified patterns of recurring results that illustrate obstacles and facilitators from which the needs arise. Negative self-perceptions and low self-regulation are among the main obstacles of the writing process, while shared writing experiences foster affective dimensions self-regulation, and improve familiarisation with the discursive community. Lastly, institutional spaces specifically dedicated to writing as well as sustained positive and constructive feedback emerged as needs.","[Calle-Arango, Lina; Avila Reyes, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Calle-Arango, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Campus San Joaquin, Santiago 4860, Chile.",linacallearango@gmail.com,"Calle-Arango, Lina/G-9459-2018","Calle-Arango, Lina/0000-0003-4362-3075","Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, ANID [folio 21180042]","This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development, ANID, under Grant folio 21180042.",,78,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0158-037X,1470-126X,,STUD CONTIN EDUC,Stud.

Analysing face-to-face peer-group classroom argumentation is challenging. There are very good analytic frameworks, but their usefulness for analysing large corpora and conducing quantitative analysis is not clear, as reliability and validity measures are often not reported. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and psychometric properties of a coding scheme to analyse argumentative moves during group-work interaction. The coding scheme was used to analyse 321 videos of fourth-grade students' group work during science lessons (unit of Forces) oriented by the same instructional design. Evidence was gathered during three experimental studies randomized at class level. We ran reliability and validity analyses. The results suggest that the coding scheme can be reliable used (in terms of both inter-rater and scale reliability) and allow to make valid inferences, and can be used to systematically relate both individual and group argumentation to individual outcomes.","[Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Avda Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile; [Freire, Paulina; Strasser, Katherine; Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl; pcfreire@uc.cl; kstrasse@uc.cl; vgrau@uc.cl,"; Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798; Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516","Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431]; Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF), under Grant FONDEF IDeA [ID14I10094]","This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants n degrees 1140995 and 1170431, and Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDEF), under Grant FONDEF IDeA ID14I10094.",,60,2,2,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1871-1871,1878-0423,,THINK SKILLS CREAT,Think.

It is a seductive policy. This article is based on the case of Chile, which in recent decades has consolidated a performative school market model. The study is based on an examination of official speeches and policy documents (a total of 84 documents), from the germination of the model in 1979 through to 2011 when the Quality Assurance Education System law was passed. Following Foucault's studies in governmentality, the analysis not only aims to understand the policies that led to the creation of the hyper-surveillance state in education, but also seeks to examine the policy rationale that made these transformations desirable. The research analysis is also intended to contribute to a broader understanding of the spread of testing and accountability policies around the world.","[Falabella, Alejandra] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Erasmo Escala 1825, Santiago 8340539, Chile",,"Falabella, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Erasmo Escala 1825, Santiago 8340539, Chile.",afalabel@uahurtado.cl,,"FALABELLA, ALEJANDRA/0000-0003-2755-4911",National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt); National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170477],"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt), National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt) [Grant number 1170477].",,85,9,13,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-161X,1552-3519,,EDUC ADMIN QUART,Educ.

Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere.","[Alo, Dominique] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Alo, Dominique; Castillo, Andrea; Marin Vial, Paula; Samaniego, Horacio] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Lab Ecoinformat, Valdivia, Chile; [Samaniego, Horacio] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Samaniego, Horacio] Inst Sistemas Complejos Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Alo, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile.; Alo, D (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservac Biodiversidad & Terr, Lab Ecoinformat, Valdivia, Chile.",dominiquealo@gmail.com,"Al�, Dominique/AAC-9127-2019; Samaniego, Horacio/O-8820-2015","Al�, Dominique/0000-0003-0579-4156; Samaniego, Horacio/0000-0002-2485-9827; Castillo, Andrea G/0000-0002-7577-0697; Marin, Paula/0000-0001-5242-7020",EXPLORA-CONICYT [ED190018]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) Doctoral FellowshipComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21150634]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT-CONICYT) [116280],"We thank EXPLORA-CONICYT for funding 'Ecoinformatica para Jovenes', Project ED190018.

Our goal is to provide ideas on future research topics and raise issues for further exploration. This research was conducted through a systematic review of articles published in the last decade in the WOS and Scopus databases. Upon reflection, we suggest the need for inclusive e-learning educational designs with greater emphasis on human diversity in all of its complexity.

The survey concluded that: (1) the victims of bullying and cyberbullying present higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being compared to non-bullied students, and those who were bullied in both channels presented higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being than those who were bullied in only one of them; (2) the victims of cyberbullying showed lower levels of individual well-being compared with those who had never been bullied, as with those who suffered face-to-face bullying.

Searching in groups is a daily practice across multiple contexts; however, the tools we use for searching online do not enable collaborative practices and traditional search models consider a single user navigating online in solitary. This paper presents a three level conceptual model, called the Collaborative Search Procedural Model, which enables the implementation of collaborative search classroom activities based on multi-user collaborative search scripts. A software solution, CollSearch, which follows the Collaborative Search Procedural Model and offers a unified tool to enable collaborative searching computer-supported classroom activities, is also presented. Empirical evaluation of the tool with high school students as part of an English as a second language course shows that students' outcomes improve when compared to non-scripted group search. Results show that by following the Collaborative Search Procedural Model students better appropriate the work they build together with their group. The OECD has highlighted the importance of collaborative work by the fact that PISA 2015 will assess collaborative problem solving; collaborative search is a fertile field for fostering better group work interactions.

Teachers and researchers worldwide are rethinking 'multiliteracies pedagogy' and 'multiliterate learning environments' to design innovative and meaningful educational spaces for young children. They pursue to better account for the role (and entanglement) of spaces, places, materiality, bodies, and power in early childhood education pedagogies. Multiliterate learning environments research offers the possibility to reconceptualize early childhood classrooms as real sites of thinking revolution and unique spaces for theorizing new contours of literacy pedagogy. This study explored and elicited early childhood teachers' thinking and making multiliterate learning environments, with an ethnographic approach. We designed a single-case study emplaced in a university's laboratory preschool. The participant observation took place for five months and had two different outspreading moments. First, to explore and familiarize with the preschool culture and to penetrate the learning environment codes, and the second, to produce ethnographic data collaboratively with in-depth interviews. Findings show that teachers' design thinking process is culturally situated and 'child interest- driven,' enabling some child agency in spatial meaning-making as co-authors of the multiliterate learning environments they inhabit. The design thinking process unfolds through an ongoing iterative and collaborative four-phased-cycle. Teachers ideate and reflect on multiliteracies and place-making decisions that materialize learning environments based on the world of children. While making multiliterate environments through this spatial design thinking process, teachers are empowered as designers and as makers of a 'third teacher,' where a wide-ranging diversity of people, texts, practices, meanings, and cultural contexts intersect to build communication.","[Cortes Loyola, Catalina; Bravo Colomer, Ursula] Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Concepcion 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile; [Adlerstein Grimberg, Cynthia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile",,"Loyola, CC (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Concepcion 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile.",catalinacortes@udd.cl; cadlerst@uc.cl; ubravo@udd.cl,"Adlerstein, Cynthia/AAV-8228-2020","Adlerstein, Cynthia/0000-0001-7174-0100",,,,130,1,1,4,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1871-1871,1878-0423,,THINK SKILLS CREAT,Think.

However, it is often difficult to keep parents involved, particularly when they lack the time or academic knowledge. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on achievement in mathematics among adolescent children when involving parents from low-income communities in the learning process. This involvement is achieved through activities that do not include any formal curricular content. A randomly selected group of parents was nudged, via text message (SMS), to complete short and simple weekly activities with their children. The teacher then connected these activities to the curricular content in class. The results reveal that, on average, the intervention increased the students' math grade point average (GPA) by 0.488 standard deviations (p < .05) more than students whose parents only received administrative text messages. This effect remains over time, extending into the following school year. These findings highlight the power of behavioral nudges that encourage positive parent-student exchanges.","[Santana, Macarena; Nussbaum, Miguel; Carmona, Raimundo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Comp, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Claro, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Chile",,"Santana, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Comp, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",mpsanta1@uc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Claro, Susana/0000-0001-5168-4164",,,,88,3,3,4,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1934-5747,1934-5739,,J RES EDUC EFF,J.

Employing a phenomenographic approach, 34 final-year students of a Bachelor in Biological Sciences and a Bachelor of Medicine, from one research-oriented Chilean university, were interviewed. Four categories of description emerged from interviews analysis. These categories range from experiencing teaching and research as disconnected activities to experiencing the relationship between teaching and research as a space to develop higher order thinking skills. Additionally, three dimensions of variation presented a more detailed picture of their experience: role of students in the research process, teaching focus and learning spaces where research is experienced. Also, when comparing the students' experiences, we found that medicine students, unlike those of biology, do not experience teaching and research as disconnected activities (category A). Besides, although both biology and medicine students experience the relationship between teaching and research as a space to develop thinking skills (category D), there is a difference between them regarding the type of skills that they can develop: analysis and problem-solving in biology and the ability to make informed decisions and raise scientific questions in medicine. These results provide useful insights on how students experience teaching and research activities and its relationship. This might prove useful to the university community to improve the way in which teaching and research are linked in the curriculum of undergraduate programmes, particularly in the biological sciences.","[Olivares-Donoso, Ruby; Gonzalez, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Olivares-Donoso, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",rrolivares@uc.cl,"Olivares-Donoso, Ruby/G-8472-2017; Gonz‡lez, Carlos/D-7228-2017","Olivares-Donoso, Ruby/0000-0001-7781-7076; Gonz‡lez, Carlos/0000-0002-3154-0777","National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CONICYT-FONDECYT Regular 1130982, CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2013-21130423]",The authors declare they have received the following funding for supporting the work presented in this paper: grant CONICYT-FONDECYT Regular 1130982 and the first author is a CONICYT Ph.D. grantee (CONICYT-PCHA/DoctoradoNacional/2013-21130423).

The assumption is that the model will work as long as schools provide families with public, pertinent, and timely information. When the right to choose freely cannot be exercised, school effectiveness can be regulated through parental participation in school activities. The main objective of this study was to estimate the effects of household socioeconomic status and type of information provided by the school on parent participation in school. A cross-sectional, quantitative, non-experimental study of the relationship between information and participation of parents with household socioeconomic status was conducted from a least squares regression analysis (OLS) and binary logistic regression models. The study is based on data from a subsample of 258 people who reported at least one child studying high school education. We used data from the Metropolitan Family and Education Survey developed by the Centro de Estudio e Investigacion sobre Familia (CEIF). The results show that parents are more willing to participate in activities related to the everyday aspects of their children's school experience. OLS models reveal some elements that positively influence parental participation: accountability (.24), personal student information (.42), and high socioeconomic status (2.49). Our conclusion is that the provision of personal student information, along with the accountability of institutional management, can increase the relative probability of a more active participation of families in functional classroom activities.","[Gubbins Foxley, Veronica] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Calle Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile; [Otero Cabrol, Gabriel] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile",,"Foxley, VG (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Calle Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago, Chile.",vgubbins@uahurtado.cl,,,,,,31,6,8,2,20,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

One of the objectives of the present study was to evaluate the effect of environmental knowledge on the pro-environmental behaviour of students in the Valparaiso region of Chile. Another objective was to analyze the effect of schools' socioeconomic group and type (i.e., municipal or private) on students' environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour. The third objective was to compare the environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour of students in high schools with and without environmental certification. We surveyed 1951 students from 21 high schools of different levels of certification, socioeconomic groups and types. We used a quantitative method based on questionnaires that contained questions on environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour. The questions were related to garbage recycling, paper recycling, scarcity of water, use of electricity, used battery disposal and use of detergents. Environmental knowledge did not affect students' pro-environmental behaviour (R-2 = 0.06; p < 0.0001). On the other hand, school socioeconomic group and type did affect students' environmental knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour (ANOVA, p > 0.05). Schools belonging to the upper-middle socioeconomic group and private schools exhibited greater environmental knowledge and better pro-environmental behaviour, in comparison with the schools belonging to the lower-middle socioeconomic group and municipal schools. However, the students of certified schools did not demonstrate greater environmental knowledge and better pro-environmental behaviour than the students of uncertified schools.","[Barazarte Castro, Raul; Neaman, Alexander; Garcia Elizalde, Pedro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Agron, Area Medio Ambiente, Quillota, Chile; [Vallejo Reyes, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Psicol, Quillota, Chile",,"Neaman, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Quillota, Chile.",alexander.neaman@ucv.cl,"Neaman, Alexander/ABF-3260-2020; Neaman, Alexander/D-4007-2016","Neaman, Alexander/0000-0002-1819-0872",,,,51,2,2,5,43,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

They are used to design professor training programs, evaluate teaching performance, and show evidence of performance to different stakeholders. SET surveys typically include an open-ended question which is not always considered in the analysis of the results. This study aims to show the contribution of analyzing the students' comments by means of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation methodology to factor them into the analysis of the quantitative part of the survey. For this purpose, a sample of 737 courses taught during 2017 and 2018 in an undergraduate program at a Chilean university is used. The results show that both the number of comments and the topics that can be extracted from them contribute significantly to the analysis of the professors' teaching performance. The topics extracted are more specific than the quantitative dimensions of the survey, which allows obtaining very concrete feedback for professors and for designing training programs. Around half of the topics extracted are actionable and do not depend on the intrinsic characteristics of the professors, which allows for effective improvements in teaching. Additionally, the extracted topics can be grouped into dimensions that have a correspondence with the quantitative dimensions of the survey, although they only cover a subset of the latter. This result provides insights to improve the survey design and adjust the weighting of its different dimensions.","[Marshall, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile",,"Marshall, P (corresponding author), Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",pmarshall@uc.cl,,,,,,43,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0729-4360,1469-8366,,HIGH EDUC RES DEV,High.

These judgments and messages reflect an absence of inclusive values, such as equity and acceptance of diversity, among the members of the dominant society. The fact that prejudiced beliefs about indigenous peoples have been upheld and passed on has contributed to the development of negative psychosocial effects and a stigmatized identity in members of such peoples. This article, set in the context of schools, seeks to identify and analyze possible expressions of ethnic prejudice among teachers in educational institutions within contexts of high social vulnerability. The methodology used is qualitative and descriptive. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews are the techniques applied. The sample is made up of 52 Chilean secondary school teachers in the Araucania region of Chile. The sample is intentionally selected in a process is guided by the project's objectives. Data analysis employs the methodological and theoretical aspects of the Grounded Theory approach. The results show that teachers are ethnically prejudiced against indigenous students. There is a stereotyped system of beliefs widely shared by members of the teaching profession. The study reveals diverse manifestations of teachers' prejudices at the cognitive, affective and behavioural levels. Diverse prejudiced beliefs and feelings towards indigenous students are unveiled; these beliefs and feelings lead to the generation of discriminatory relational dynamics, which implicitly transmit messages of inferiority and devaluation in different forms to indigenous students. Teachers from schools in indigenous contexts are barely conscious of the prejudices with which they operate. Their practices are found to lie far from a social perspective based on acceptance of diversity in the classroom, regard for people as individuals and equity.","Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Educ, Temuco, Region De La Ar, Chile",,"Pena, SB (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Educ, Manuel Montt 56, Temuco, Region De La Ar, Chile.",sbecerra@uct.cl,,,,,,38,1,1,1,9,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

An increasingly critical challenge is how to most effectively engage with student perspectives to more effectively understand the nature of their learning experiences. Traditionally, student ratings have been the primary means with which to understand the student voice. Although approaches to student ratings have fragmented in recent years with diversifying research interest in student satisfaction, experience and engagement, relatively limited attention has been given to the epistemological underpinnings of ratings-based surveys or toward emerging alternative approaches to engaging the student voice. This paper analyses the epistemic foundations of ratings-based methods in the context of other emerging strategies that attempt to engage with student voices more collaboratively. From this analysis, a map of the range of current and emerging approaches to the capturing of the student evaluative voice is proposed to identify their key characteristics in understanding and prospectively shaping practice. This analysis demonstrates that although alternative methods possess a clear potential to respond more effectively to the ever more complex pedagogical demands, their potential is limited by the hegemony of the 'surveyed voice' and the resource challenges of sustaining heightened student engagement.","[Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Darwin, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",sdarwin@uahurtado.cl,"Darwin, Stephen/AAS-9549-2020","Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451",Chilean government under the FONDECYT program [1170314],This work was supported by the Chilean government under the FONDECYT program [grant number 1170314].,,73,2,2,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0729-4360,1469-8366,,HIGH EDUC RES DEV,High.

This descriptive research is based on a mixed methods approach. The proposal was intended through theoretical and empirical references related to the accreditation systems. The analysis process was conducted with key informants, and the informatics instrument was created and validated through expert judgment. After the analysis, the model was optimized considering the expert's suggestions. As a result of the optimization process, a matrix of eight dimensions was obtained and it is available online in order to be used by the heads of postgraduate programs. Finally, a model with four main stages was achieved in order to install a self-regulation and a self-evaluated culture that leads to accreditation as evidence of the quality of postgraduate programs.","[Careaga Butter, Marcelo; Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela; Jimenez Perez, Laura; Sepulveda Valenzuela, Eileen] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Meyer Aguilera, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Butter, MC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.",,"Badilla, Maria/T-3880-2019; Quintana, Maria Graciela Badilla/AAB-1015-2019; Sepulveda-Valenzuela, Eileen/AAB-8103-2019","Quintana, Maria Graciela Badilla/0000-0002-1317-9228; Sepulveda-Valenzuela, Eileen/0000-0002-7506-9243",Unit of Educational Computing and Knowledge Management; Faculty of Education of Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion,"This research is conducted with the support of the Postgraduate Direction and the Unit of Educational Computing and Knowledge Management, from the Faculty of Education of Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion.",,32,3,3,0,19,ATHABASCA UNIV PRESS,ATHABASCA,"1 UNIVERSITY DR, ATHABASCA, AB T9S 3A3, CANADA",1492-3831,,,INT REV RES OPEN DIS,Int.

I argue that a stable policy environment, where change is only marginal or incremental, begets research problems and questions squarely situated within the boundaries of the established rules of the game. Conversely, whenever policy swerves considerably off its expected path, knowledge may not be available to illuminate policy-making. The motif of disassociation between the policy field in the making with the availability of knowledge to support it is probed via the analysis of two policy proposals currently in Chile's new government agenda: introducing tuition-free higher education and assuming greater state oversight of teacher education programs.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Bernasconi, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.",abernasconi@uc.cl,"Bernasconi, AndrŽs/I-9041-2012","Bernasconi, AndrŽs/0000-0001-8008-3747",,,,28,4,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

Teachers participated in a 1-year professional development intervention that included training and expert coaching. Results: Positive intervention effects were observed on children's knowledge of the alphabet, emergent writing and word identification. There was no effect on children's oral language outcomes.

Under the focus of an instrumental case study, the decisions and arguments of Chilean high school students are analyzed. The results indicate that there are both beneficial and harmful relationships between proportional and probabilistic thinking, and that the difficulties in determining probabilities are not necessarily due to the absence of the use of proportions.

One of its importances relies on the fact that it affects in a direct way the learning potential. It has been shown that, even thou cognitive processes develop side by side with biological maturity, this cognitive development can be enhanced by means of mediated learning as signaled by Feuerstein's Mediated Learning theory. Based on this theory is that we propose an intervention model that addresses school academic issues using technologically assisted small group collaboration, pursuing a dual academic objective: to thrive students' cognitive processes while addressing school curriculum topics. The purpose, therefore, is to balance the students' cognitive differences by means of in-school content-filled classroom activities. Our aim is to make use of peer mediation in a real world setting with a virtual construction of it. In this paper, we describe this novel intervention model along with an in-school usage experience. For this, we present an activity designed for high school students, specifically aimed to assist the learning of kinematics, graph interpretation, and graph plotting. In this activity the students work in groups of three, using a robot and wirelessly interconnected Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). By means of a controlled experiment, we show how technologically-supported peer mediation promotes the students' enrichment of their cognitive processes in each of the different stages of the mental act (input-elaboration-output), favoring communication skills, insight, and reasoning, while also restraining impulsive conduct and trial-and-error answers.","[Mitnik, Ruben; Nussbaum, Miguel; Recabarren, Matias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 22, Chile",,"Mitnik, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, POB 306, Santiago 22, Chile.",rmitnik@ing.puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; mrecabarren@ing.puc.cl,"Recabarren, Matias/AAZ-5945-2021; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",,,,20,16,16,0,20,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN",TAIPEI,"129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN",1436-4522,,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Major conclusion set up that despite increased participation across all socio-economic groups within the post secondary system, upper and upper-middle income students gained access to higher education disproportionately compared to lower, lower-middle, and middle income groups during the 1987-1998 period.","Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Acad, Santiago 8370179, Chile",,"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Vicerrectoria Acad, Manuel RodrA-guez Sur NA 0415, Santiago 8370179, Chile.",oscar.espinoza@udp.cl,"Oliveira, Aline L/D-2475-2011",,,,,27,29,36,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,,,HIGH EDUC,High.

However, participation in ECE programs is not equally distributed across social groups. It has been observed in different international contexts that there are factors such as availability, accessibility and affordability that hinder access for disadvantaged families. Chile has promoted policies to reduce these factors: greater availability of centers, priority selection in admission and free tuition. Through 56 semi-structured interviews from 7 centers, non-participant observations for six months in one of the centers and one year of fieldwork, we sought to understand access to ECE. The results show that, despite priority access policies, there are decisions on availability, implementation of accessibility and funding-oriented affordability practices that hinder access. This work provides new evidence and discusses the implications of the results for equitable access to ECE for disadvantaged families.","[Barco, Blanca; Carrasco, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Barco, B (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",bsbarco@uc.cl,"Barco, Blanca/H-8179-2017","Barco, Blanca/0000-0003-1461-1462","ANID [PIA CJE 160007]; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional [2014-21140206]; Faculty of Education Doctoral Program, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Both authors are grateful for support from ANID PIA CJE 160007; CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2014-21140206 and Faculty of Education Doctoral Program, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile;",,56,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0957-5146,1472-4421,,EARLY YEARS-ABINGDON,Early Years,OCT 19,2020,40,4-5,,,,,400,415,,10.1080/09575146.2020.1742097,,APR 2020,16,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,PH5MJ,WOS:000523314400001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,early years,Q4

They offer a vocabulary of imagined micro-policies. Using the case of Chile, this paper examines the ways in which accountability policies are reworked within schools and how they affect actors' subjectivities. It adds new findings to the existing body of research on school accountability policies, offering in-depth evidence based on the case of Chile, which has a high-stakes testing model and a widespread competitive voucher system. The research is based on case studies of ten public and private subsidised schools, framed by a sociological perspective of policy enactment theory. The research findings show the ways that accountability policies are recreated, expanded, and intensified at the local level, permeating an ethic of competition. The analysis focuses on three qualitative trends: school actors' sense-making of test scores and labels; zones of safety and risk for teachers under an accountability regime; and the emergence of a sticky web of persuasion, surveillance, and coercion among school members in order to improve performance. The practices examined are not understood as 'secondary effects' or an 'implementation problem', as if they occur unconnected from the policy rationale. The outcomes are consistent with the policy itself in interaction with school life.","[Falabella, Alejandra] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Educ Policies & Sch Dev, Santiago, Chile",,"Falabella, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Erasmo Escala 1825, Santiago, Chile.",afalabel@uahurtado.cl,,"FALABELLA, ALEJANDRA/0000-0003-2755-4911","National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt), National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt) [11140302]","This work was supported by the National Commission of Scientific Research and Technology (Conicyt), National Fund of Scientific Development and Technology (Fondecyt) [grant number 11140302].",,80,15,18,5,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-0939,1464-5106,,J EDUC POLICY,J.

The questions guiding the study were to what extent school staff share similar perspectives toward victimisation (as demonstrative of a school culture), and how this impacts the capacity to generate positive school climates in multi-ethnic elementary urban schools in Santiago. Drawing on theories of school culture, I propose that staff members' abilities and willingness to identify and implement preventive measures in schools are collectively defined and legitimated. I demonstrate that this has important repercussions in contexts of higher-than-average ethnic compositions where assimilation is encouraged, and victimisation is denied or attributed to other causes. Symbolic and superficial celebrations of multiculturalism are common, but cultural discourses of difference maintain ethnic youth in marginalised positions and prevent more inclusive educational practices. Some staff perspectives adhere to colour-blind liberal forms of racism in these contexts, and these are most common in school cultures where victimisation is downplayed or thought to be an issue cultivated in the home. Recommendations are made to incorporate culturally-sensitive pedagogies and cultural mediators to confront these narratives among school climate committees.","[Webb, Andrew] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vikuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Ave Vikuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.",Andrew.webb@uc.cl,,"Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670","Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [FONDAP 15110006]; Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism grant Millenium Nucleus for the Study of the Life Course and Vulnerability; Conicyt/Fondecyt RegularComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1190604]","This work was supported by Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [grant number FONDAP 15110006], and the Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism grant Millenium Nucleus for the Study of the Life Course and Vulnerability.

One obstacle to acceptance arises from a culture of quantitative assessment (often represented by a single mark), which is at odds with the concept of outcome assessment which is by essence subjective, qualitative and multidimensional. The method presented here is specifically concerned with learning activities where students need to demonstrate competency in learning outcomes of different natures. It describes a methodological framework that can be used in any programme that aims at developing multidimensional learners, but operates in a context where the final assessment product is a single quantitative grade. This method follows a classical approach to the evaluation of each learning outcome. It then proposes an innovative way of ranking students by categorising their overall performance based on conditions that reflect the integral nature of the learning process, to allow teaching staff to assign a range of marks for each student. Finally, a last step allows a quantitative ranking of students within each category, yielding a single quantitative mark for the course while remaining coherent with the learning goals.","[Serandour, Guillaume; Illanes, Alfredo; Maturana, Jorge] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile; [Cadiz, Janet] Univ Austral Chile, Dept Aseguramiento Calidad & Innovac Curricular, Valdivia, Chile",,"Serandour, G (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile.",gserandour@uach.cl,"SŽrandour, Guillaume/AAM-1087-2020",,,,,31,0,0,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0260-2938,1469-297X,,ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU,Assess.

This article addresses the incidence of this dimension on school leadership, showing the differences and continuities established among primary school principals in the subsidized private and municipal sectors. The conclusion is that private school administrators do not recruit principals on a competitive basis, as a result of which these principals do not present a more developed professional profile, and that merely having more duties for executing the principal position - as happens in subsidized private schools - is not enough for an effective development of practices evidencing improved school leadership. These conclusions challenge the statement frequently expressed, but lacking sufficient empirical evidence, that the greater autonomy in school management encompassed by privatization will positively impact on school leadership and, therefore, on educational improvement.","[Weinstein, Jose; Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Munoz, G (corresponding author), Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",gonzalo.munozs@mail.udp.cl,"Mu–oz, Gonzalo/ABG-3838-2020","Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841",,,,34,11,13,3,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0924-3453,1744-5124,,SCH EFF SCH IMPROV,Sch.

In the other six schools, social relations were marked by distrust, staff constructed students as lacking the resources necessary to benefit from a rigorous academic programme, and parents in leadership positions shared with teachers the belief that school failure could largely be attributed to uncommitted parents.

J,"Espinoza, O",,,,"Espinoza, Oscar",,,Solving the equity-equality conceptual dilemma: a new model for analysis of the educational process,educational research,,,English,Article,,,,,,equity; equality; excellence; model; goal; critical theory,OPPORTUNITY; EXCELLENCE; JUSTICE,"Background Over the past four decades there have been a number of controversies arising from the discussion of 'equity' and 'equality'. These concepts are often invoked by policy analysts, policy-makers, government officials and scholars in order to justify or critique resource allocation to different levels of the educational system. Purpose By creating a new equality-equity goal-oriented model, which allows the combination of different dimensions for each concept with different stages of the educational process, this paper aims to achieve two purposes: (1) to clarify among researchers, educators, evaluators, policy analysts, and policy-makers the notions of 'equality' and 'equity'; and (2) to encourage researchers and evaluators to critically examine and synthesize equality/equity-based research. Sources of evidence A review of the literature concerning the meaning, goals and assumptions of the concepts 'equity' and 'equality', and their implications for social and public policy, is presented. Main argument A survey of recent and earlier debates on 'equity' and 'equality' among scholars and researchers reveals disagreement and confusion about what those concepts really mean and what they involve in terms of goals and results. It is debatable whether we can have 'equity' and 'equality' in a society that prioritizes efficiency in resource management over social justice. Certainly, such questions have shaped and guided many discussions and theoretical debates among scholars, policy analysts and policy-makers. Conclusions Most of the definitions of 'equity' and 'equality' are frequently used by many researchers, evaluators, policy-makers, policy analysts, scholars and educators as if they were interchangeable. Instead of arguing for a unique or simple conception of 'equity' and 'equality', a set of definitions of those concepts as well as a discussion related to theoretical and policy issues associated are presented. In order to avoid that confusion, the equality-equity model developed in this paper suggests several new directions for analysis and research. It provides some ideas about how 'equity' (i.e. 'equity for equal needs', 'equity for equal potential' and 'equity for equal achievement') and 'equality' (i.e. 'equality of opportunity', 'equality for all' and 'equality on average across social groups') could be treated and measured in future research in relation to different features of the educational process (availability of resources, access, survival, output and outcome).","Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile",,"Espinoza, O (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Manuel Rodriguez Sur 415, Santiago, Chile.",pirata14@hotmail.com,,,,,,97,71,79,4,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1881,1469-5847,,EDUC RES-UK,Educ.

Self-efficacy is a key component in the acquisition of procedural skills. Therefore, professionals' self-efficacy in arterial puncture should be measured before attempting the procedure on real patients. Objective: To develop and psychometrically assess a self-efficacy scale in arterial puncture. Design: An observational cross-sectional design was used in this study. Setting: Faculty of Education Sciences, Nursing and Physiotherapy in a higher education institution in the south of Spain. Participants: A convenience sample of 342 nursing students entered and completed the study. All participants met the following inclusion criteria: (1) >= 18 years old and (2) enrolled in a nursing degree programme during the 2014/2015 academic year. Participants were 74% female (n = 254) and their age ranged from 18 to 50, with a mean age of 21.74 years (SD = 5.14). Method: The Arterial Puncture Self-Efficacy Scale (APSES) was developed and psychometrically tested. Reliability and content validity were studied. Predictive validity and concurrent validity assessed criterion validity. In addition, principal component analysis and known-group analysis evaluated construct validity. Results: Principal component analysis revealed the two-subscale structure of the final 22-item version of the Arterial Puncture Self-Efficacy Scale (APSES). A total Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97 showed its high reliability. The APSES' content validity index was excellent (S-CVI/Ave = 0.95). Predictive and concurrent validity analysis demonstrated the good criterion validity of the tool. Supporting the APSES' sensitivity and specificity, known-groups analysis evidenced significant differences (p < 0.001) in self-efficacy levels between groups. Conclusion: The APSES showed good psychometric properties for measuring self-efficacy in arterial puncture for ABG analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, educational institutions had to move abruptly from in-person to online classes, having to be flexible and innovative, one of the main concerns being the semester-end examinations in practical modules. Objective: This study aimed to explore nursing students' perceptions of the use of a serious game-like model in their final online objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Design: An exploratory phenomenological study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during June 2020. Settings: This study took place at the University of Almeria with nursing students enrolled in a clinical placement module. Participants: Eighty-nine fourth-year nursing students took part in this study. Methods: Following the educational principles of the OSCE, a virtual OSCE was designed, using the Genially platform, an online platform for creating interactive content, to set up an assessment as a story-telling game-like model. A total of 5 focus groups (FGs) were conducted afterwards via the GoogleMeet platform. In addition, 30 semi-structured interviews were performed via the same platform. The data was analysed using a content analysis approach and supported by the ATLAS.ti 8.4 software. Results: Our finding revealed 2 main themes and 4 sub-themes. The two main themes were (i) generating emotions and feelings in times of virtuality; including emotions and feelings experienced by students during their online assessment process, and (ii) online assessment: a potential alternative to educational barriers; describing the variability of traditional modality, its implications for learning and the acquisition of competences. Conclusions: Serious game-like models, such as the story-telling game proposed, as part of their online OSCE assessment appear to be an appropriate alternative assessment method for face-to-face approaches. This paper adds new evidence on the use of innovative and state-of-art resources as part of nursing OSCE assessments in a new reality for most students and teachers. Serious game-like models in online OSCE may empower students and help them to remove perceived barriers in face-to-face assessments.","[Roman, Pablo; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Cristofer; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing Sci Physiotherapy & Med, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Roman, Pablo; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Res Grp CTS 451 Hlth Sci, Almeria, Spain; [Roman, Pablo; Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano; Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Univ Almeria, Hlth Res Ctr, Almeria, Spain; [Ruiz-Gonzalez, Cristofer] Torrecardenas Univ Hosp, Almeria 04009, Spain; [Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel] Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Predept Nursing, Av Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel] Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Res Grp CYS, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Granero-Molina, Jose; Fernandez-Sola, Cayetano] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Hlth Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Manuel Hernandez-Padilla, Jose] Middlesex Univ, Sch Hlth & Educ, Adult Child & Midwifery Dept, London, England",,"Rodriguez-Arrastia, M (corresponding author), Jaume I Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Predept Nursing, Av Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",pablo.roman@ual.es; arrastia@uji.es; jgranero@ual.es; cfernan@ual.es; j.hernandez-padilla@ual.es,"Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/R-2920-2018","Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel/0000-0001-9430-4272",,,,34,0,0,6,6,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

Implementing these activities requires course redesign, which must be meticulous for their full potential to be reached. This can require a lot of work for first time users, which can be a barrier to implementation. Educational design patterns alleviate this burden by facilitating new course design with practices demonstrated to promote student engagement. This paper reports on the redesign of an introductory programming course and its experimental evaluation. The redesign was based on the community of inquiry learning framework (CoL), using design patterns from online Web communities and team-based learning (TBL). The evaluation included 562 students, 117 of them randomly assigned to two different experimental groups. One group used a CoL approach, and the other a blended TBL and CoL methodology. The remaining students were assigned to control groups. Results showed that students in the experimental groups outperformed those in the control group by the end of the semester, while the experimental CoL and TBL methodology helped students achieve a higher level of understanding in a shorter period of time due to increased participation rates. These data provide empirical evidence of the learning gains offered by online learning communities, and the way in which educational design patterns can facilitate course redesign.","[Cabrera, Ignacio] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Sci & Engn, Penalolen 7941169, Chile; [Villalon, Jorge] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago 8790922, Chile; [Chavez, Jorge] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago 7510287, Chile",,"Villalon, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Econ & Business, Santiago 8790922, Chile.",jorge.villalon@udp.cl,,"Chavez, jorge/0000-0001-7603-4766; Villalon, Jorge/0000-0003-3021-3827",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FONDECYT 11130055],This work was supported by Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica CONICYT under Grant FONDECYT 11130055.,,46,19,19,4,28,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9359,1557-9638,,IEEE T EDUC,IEEE Trans.

The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course.","[LeBoeuf, Richard L.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez, Jorge T.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Gomez, JT (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",jtgomez1@uc.cl,,"LeBoeuf, Richard/0000-0002-0427-6069",,,,41,8,8,3,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Equated scores are obtained estimating the equating transformation function, which maps the scores on the scale of one test form into their equivalents on the scale of other one. All the statistical models that have been proposed for estimating this function are based on continuous approximations of the score distributions, leading to equated scores lying on a continuous scale even though score scales are usually subsets of the integer numbers (e.g., the total number of correct answers). In this article, we develop a new equating method from which equated scores defined on the original discrete scale are obtained. Considering scores as ordinal random variables, we propose a continuous latent variable formulation to perform an equipercentile-like equating based on a Bayesian nonparametric model for score distributions. The proposed model is applied to simulated and real data collected under an equivalent group design. Some methods to assess the performance of our model are also discussed. Compared with discrete versions of equated scored obtained from traditional equating methods, the results show that the proposed method has better performance.","[Varas, Ines M.; Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LIES, Santiago, Chile; [Quintana, Fernando A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Varas, IM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, LIES, Santiago, Chile.",imvaras@mat.uc.cl; jorge.gonzalez@mat.uc.cl; quintana@mat.puc.cl,,"Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795; Varas Caceres, Ines Maria/0000-0002-1628-1797","CONICYT Doctorado Nacional grant [21151486]; Swedish MMW grant [2019.0129]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180034]; Millennium Science Initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism, grant Millenium Nucleus Center for the Discovery of Structures in Complex Data","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: In ' es M.

The STEM fields are particularly critical in the development of these modern, more just societies. In the United States, the social and racial justice debates are ever more relevant and present in academia. Studies focused on under-represented and under-served groups in education, especially STEM fields, are timely and of paramount importance. This is a study that analyzed student data of 19 institutions, concentrated in what is known as the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD). It utilized multilevel (HLM) analysis focused on the Time to Graduate outcome of under-represented populations, emphasizing the Latino/Hispanics group. Multilevel analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate differences in groups such as institutions and races/ethnicities, which is the type of data MIDFIELD affords. Results show that depending on the multilevel model, either fixed or random slope, there is a significant difference between the number of terms taken to graduate for under-represented groups, including Latinos/ Hispanics, compared to White groups and for Black compared to White groups. This suggests that Black students tend to be more impacted by their institution than other racial/ethnical groups. Since the emphasis was Latinos/Hispanics, the question remaining is if these results transfer to a sample with more Latino/Hispanic representation.","[Diaz, Noemi V.

This study sought to understand the strengths and weaknesses of using TBL in a specific subject (anatomy), discipline (veterinary medicine), and country (Chile). Students in the course had not been previously exposed to TBL. At the end of the semester during which TBL was used, the research team collected student satisfaction survey data and conducted a focus group in order to understand students' experiences with TBL in the course. We found that overall, students were satisfied with TBL and appreciated that it increased the amount of feedback they received, reinforced key concepts, and helped them to build skills they would need in their future professions.There was also a certain level of dissatisfaction, which may have been caused by negative experiences with team members and difficulties reading the preparatory material, which was in English.

While structural and organisational aspects of teaching are frequently assessed, programme evaluation tools are rarely matched to specific learning objectives and competence levels that students are expected to achieve. Driven by the shortcomings of previous unstructured surveys on the quality of teaching at our Faculty, we created a curriculum improvement framework based on the evaluation tool that compares the level of competence that students perceive they achieved in each of the courses, and the level of competence that professors attribute to their courses by quantifying the learning outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy. In our two year study, which included seven teachers who teach 16 courses and 38 and 24 students in two consecutive years, this framework provided the educators with the indicators for quality enhancement based on the difference between students' and teachers' evaluations. Based on indicator values, the teacher implemented improvements on two pilot courses. In the second round of surveys, we were able to measure the success of improvements. Our findings indicate that the proposed framework and evaluation tool are simple to implement and can be used as indicators and starting points for improving the quality of teaching. In this way, we provide a practical framework for others wishing to enhance their teaching and their students' learning.","[Stojadinovic, Zoran; Nadazdi, Ana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Civil Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia; [Bozic, Marija] Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile",,"Stojadinovic, Z (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Civil Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia.",joka@grf.bg.ac.rs; marija.bozic@e-campus.uab.cat; anikolic.grf@gmail.com,"Stojadinovic, Zoran/AAU-2915-2021","Stojadinovic, Zoran/0000-0002-9535-9977",,,,21,1,1,0,0,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

It provides opportunities for change in both the curriculum of the programme and the pedagogy of delivery. However, the starting point is with staff to acquire educational knowledge applicable to engineering education. It is argued that accreditation could indeed be an opportunity for a change with positive consequences for the institution, faculty, department, curriculum, academic staff, students and industry, and discusses the challenges during the accreditation process. The objective of this paper is to review the paradigm shift from teaching to learning and how adjustment of a curriculum to a particular accreditation criterion affects the stakeholders. It is acknowledged that accreditation may provide benefits in educational and organizational quality improvements as it encourages awareness of the best practices, increases public confidence and ensures institutional accountability. However, it also entails some inherent challenges such as additional costs, increased staff workload, uncertainty regarding its effectiveness and possibly organizational concerns. Accreditation creates opportunities for change; including the fundamental adjustment in the curriculum of the programme. However, a key element is staff trained to apply educational knowledge and principles for engineering education, which is usually deficient in faculty members. A successful shift in the educational paradigm needs an understanding of the rationale for the outcomes-based educational approach and philosophy as well as the concept of attributes and non-conventional pedagogy.","[Uziak, Jacek] Univ Botswana, Dept Mech Engn, P Bag UB0061, Gaborone, Botswana; [Oladiran, M.

Although the mainstream core of engineering design trains students to face teamwork from a co-located standpoint, existing studies point out the benefits and tradeoffs of distributed team training. This article explores the complexities of working in distributed teams by assessing distributed team experiences on three different continents. To achieve this goal, the study was organized in two stages. In the first stage, a framework was developed based on a yearlong mixed-methods study where four engineering teams from two prestigious universities in Chile and the U.S. worked together on open-ended problem-based challenges. Subsequently, the data from other 11 teams including distributed work among students in Chile, the U.S., and Finland, in the period spanning from 2016 to 2017, was collected and analyzed. A time tracking research instrument was created assessing how teams allocate their efforts within the design process and how this allocation varies across co-located and distributed teams. In addition, 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with students from the first stage in order to triangulate the information. Findings show that distributed and co-located teams spend similar amount of time in convergent and divergent design activities. Moreover, evaluators identified improvements in the end solutions designed by students since there seems to be a cultural and academic complementation in the solutions proposed by distributed teams. All teams tend to use more time on convergent activities rather than divergent ones, especially when preparing presentations for a larger class group. Special attention should be paid on the convergent stages of teams' design processes in order to provide the right educational scaffolding to facilitate learning. This study sought to shed a light on the possibilities of working with geographically distributed teams, and we found that, overall, the trade-offs are not significant.","[Miranda, Constanza; Goni, Julian Inani] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile; [Lugo, Jose] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Mech Engn, PR-108, Mayaguez, PR 00682 USA",,"Miranda, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DILAB Sch Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Stgo, Chile.",csmirand@uc.cl; jvgoni@uc.cl; ihillige@ing.puc.cl; jose.lugo2@upr.edu,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Miranda, Constanza/ABB-2399-2020","Miranda, Constanza/0000-0002-9110-2832; Goni, Julian Inaki/0000-0002-0170-3416",,,,31,0,0,0,4,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

This is a modification of the Brans-Dicke theory by the addition of a term in the Lagrangian which is non-linear in the derivatives of the scalar field: it contains second-order derivatives. This is the basis of the so-called Brans-Dicke Galileon. We pay special attention to the variational principle and to the algebraic details of the derivation. It is shown how higher order derivatives of the fields appearing in the intermediate computations cancel out leading to second order motion equations. The reader will find useful tips for the derivation of the field equations of modifications of general relativity such as the scalar-tensor theories and f (R) theories, by means of the (stationary action) variational principle.

Evidence suggests differences in HLE components based on cultural and idiosyncratic characteristics. Most studies show a relationship between contextual variables with the quality of HLE in typically developing (TD) children. There are HLE studies with families of children with Down syndrome (DS) that show similar results, but the characteristics of HLE for Latin-American families of children with DS remain unexplored. This study analyses the HLE in a group of 161 families of children with DS, between 3 and 12 years of age, living in urban areas of Chile. Data were collected using an online survey. Results showed differences on the amount of literacy materials, linguistic environment, and beliefs and expectations of parents. Better HLE was observed in families with parents with high educational levels. In the context of previous studies from developed countries with families of children with DS and from Chile with families of TD children, the HLE of families with children with DS in Chile seems poor.

The first critical step of the PMEL framework requires thoughtful exploration of `` pathways'' to community change: a series of proposed actions that lead to a set of positive outcomes within the community. In this study, we investigate the benefit of using Group Model Building (GMB) as a way to improve the outcome of brainstorming sessions, a key aspect of team decision making within this first step of the PMEL framework. Here we posit an important mechanism for an improved outcome in brainstorming sessions would be a shift in student mental models towards system thinking. In order to assess the value proposition of GMB in project decision making, a two-session GMB workshop was held with a EWB-USA student team working on a rural water project in Peru. A mixed-methods approach was used to extract and analyze participant mental models before and after the workshop to measure growth in systems thinking. The results of the study indicate compelling shifts in participants' mental models towards those of systems thinkers, including an understanding of important factors and how they influence as a system to impact project sustainability. Marked changes in project planning action items were also observed along with an alignment of their proposed change pathways. Overall, the project team gained a more complete understanding and appreciation of project complexity and of the factors that contribute to project success. Thus, GMBprovides a useful technique to teach engineering students systems thinking, while possibly improving the quality, and thus sustainability, of EWB community development projects.","[Walters, Jeffrey P.] Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Ave Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Greiner, Benjamin; Amadei, Bernard] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, 1111 Engn Dr,ECOT512, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [O'Morrow, Emily] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Walters, JP (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Ave Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile.",jeffrey.walters@udp.cl; benjamin.greiner@colorado.edu; emily.omorrow@colorado.edu; amadei@colorado.edu,,"Walters, Jeffrey/0000-0001-6655-1233",,,,62,2,2,0,10,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

In the present study, we investigate students' perceptions of physics' relevance by comparing results by country, student semester, and gender. This is a quantitative comparative study between engineering students from Mexico and Chile. A total of 1,323 engineering students enrolled in physics courses in two private universities from those countries in their first and third semester responded to an eleven-item 5-Likert scale-type statements survey. Results showed that students in their first semester perceive the importance of physics more positively than students in their third semester. In general, students in the Mexican university have higher perceptions of physics' importance in engineering than students in the Chilean institution. Male and female students have similar perceptions about the relevance of physics. However, female students have a slightly higher perception of physics' importance for their ongoing studies in engineering than their male peers in the Mexican institution, opposite to what the results show in the Chilean institution. Reflecting upon the results and discussion of this contribution, some recommendations are: redesign physics courses to include activities in which students are in contact with real-life situations in classes, emphasizing the engineering part of the problem; promote active learning strategies in which students participate in the construction of their learning by interdisciplinary and gender-perspective approaches; and, include the student perspective in the curriculum and teaching materials by involving the higher-year students to demonstrate the relevance of physics to their first-year peers. As students are aware and perceive the relevance of their learning, they will be able to apply their knowledge in different academic careers and professional life situations.","[Quezada-Espinoza, Monica; Dominguez, Angeles; Zavala, Genaro] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile; [Dominguez, Angeles] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey, Mexico; [Zavala, Genaro] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, Mexico",,"Quezada-Espinoza, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile.",monica.quezada@unab.cl; angeles.dominguez@tec.mx; genaro.zavala@tec.mx,,,"Writing Lab, Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico","We acknowledge lecturers from the two institutions who took part in this study, who devoted class time for the survey administration, and all the students who partici-pated in this study.

The aim of this study, using a cadaveric model, was to compare the biomechanical resistance to the pronosupination movement of arthroscopic repair with anchor and pull-out techniques in TFCC tears of Atzei type II lesions. Eighteen forearms of cadaveric specimens were evaluated arthroscopically, of which 12 were selected according to the inclusion criteria. All specimens were injured with an Atzei type II lesion and were repaired arthroscopically. Six forearms were repaired using the anchor technique and the other six with the pull-out technique. To assess the biomechanical resistance of the repair, the forearms were tested to 300 cycles of 160 degrees pronosupination. Two evaluators independently assessed the repair status every 10 cycles and the modified Desai classification was used to verify the presence of failure. The mean failure of the repair occurred at 41.6 cycles (SD 7.5) for the pull-out technique and at 28.3 cycles (SD 9.8) for the anchor technique, showing a difference of 13.3 cycles (p = 0.025) in favor of the pull-out technique. In all cases, repair failure occurred at the junction of the fibrocartilage with the suture. Arthroscopic repair with the pull-out technique showed greater biomechanical resistance to pronosupination movement in comparison to the anchor technique.

As a result, employees concentrate on day-to-day activities with little time or motivation to generate creative ideas. Generally, the technological improvements of these companies arise as a result of problem-solving at the construction site. Nevertheless, the actual status quo is changing. Some Spanish public agencies are already considering innovation as an added value in public procurement; thus, large contractors are starting to systemize their innovative efforts. This means that small-sized and medium-sized enterprises must modify their attitudes towards innovation in order to sustain their competitiveness. The implementation of a system that enhances innovation and acquisition of knowledge may be the solution to overcome this disadvantage. The implementation of an innovation management system was analyzed in a Spanish construction firm of medium size for 9 years. The system builds on a set of processes aimed to generate innovation projects that allow the contractor to document the innovation, not only for internal purposes related to knowledge management, but also for external ones associated with obtaining better results in public tenders. These processes are as follows: (1)technology watch, (2)creativity, (3)planning and executing innovation projects, (4)technology transfer, and (5)protection of results. The final step is the feedback of the entire process through the assessment of the final outcomes. The implementation of the innovation system is ensured within the organization, through training of personnel, participation of stakeholders, and encouragement of the innovation culture.

This program uses the conceptual change approach as a framework in a recursive way, and it is specially designed to promote and ensure the use of active and innovative methodologies. The development program consists of six steps that aim to strengthen a learning community that fosters interaction of professors with common problems, interests, and experiences in a way that the collegial work sustains over time the dynamic and improved incorporation of active methodologies for teaching and learning. For this paper, we focus on the structure and some results. The results are related to faculty, students and institutional perceptions. We have evidence that faculty in this program changes their own perceptions as instructors towards reflecting whether their role is less regarding to transmitting knowledge, notes, and presentations to students. In the case of students, after a survey in courses in which participants were implementing educational strategies from the program, students' view is positive towards the activities. Students indicated that they learned more and that those strategies should be used in other courses. Institutionally, the achievements of faculty in the program and the program itself received recognition by the university.","[Dominguez, Angeles] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey, Mexico; [Dominguez, Angeles; Elena Truyol, Maria; Zavala, Genaro] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile; [Zavala, Genaro] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey, Mexico",,"Dominguez, A (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Morones Prieto 3000, Monterrey, Mexico.; Dominguez, A (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ingn, Antonio Varas 880, Santiago, Chile.",angeles.dominguez@tec.mx; maria.truyol@unab.cl; genaro.zavala@tec.mx,"Zavala, Genaro/P-7190-2016; DOMINGUEZ, Angeles/B-8879-2016","Zavala, Genaro/0000-0001-5880-1124; DOMINGUEZ, Angeles/0000-0001-6066-355X",School of Engineering at Universidad Andres Bello,"We would like to thank the School of Engineering at Universidad Andres Bello for all the support received throughout this project, to the participating faculty for all their enthusiasm, believing in the process, and for accepting the challenge of building a better education for our students.",,19,4,4,0,10,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on the Learning Spiral as a framework for curriculum design in connectivisim and in the co-association, it created lessons, activities, and projects in order to create dynamic learning situations that contribute to the development of thinking skills and mental habits of first-year college students of technical engineering education at the Higher Technical Network Administration and Computational Support of the Lota Arauco Technical Training Center at the University of Concepcion. To analyze the experience, it proposed an evaluation model that was built using ICT, evaluative principles, a defined competencies standard, evidence and types of ICT assessment. As data instrument collection, rubrics were used that allowed to determine what students did with and without ICT. Main results of this experience are the generation of a methodological and evaluative model that facilitates theoretical learning, from the paradigm of learning using ICT, for example to promote higher competencies development in students, incorporating ICT seamlessly into a learning activity, increasing motivation and collaborative work in the physical and virtual classrooms.","[Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Educ Comp Unit, Concepcion, Chile; [Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Carrasco Saez, Jose Luis] Univ Concepcion, Lota Arauco Tech Training Ctr, ICT Area, Concepcion, Chile; [Prats Fernandez, Miquel Angel] Univ Ramon Llull, FPCEE Blanquerna, Barcelona, Spain",,"Quintana, MGB (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Educ Comp Unit, Alonso de Ribera Ave 2850, Concepcion, Chile.",mgbadilla@ucsc.cl; jlcarrasc@cftlotarauco.cl; miquelpf@blanquerna.url.edu,"Badilla, Maria/T-3880-2019; Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela/B-3142-2017; Prats Fern‡ndez, Miquel Ëngel/D-5394-2014","Badilla Quintana, Maria Graciela/0000-0002-1317-9228; Prats Fern‡ndez, Miquel Ëngel/0000-0002-9542-7888",,,,30,4,4,1,32,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

These include problem-based learning or collaborative learning. In certain areas, such as engineering, project-led learning collects some of the benefits of problem-based learning and integrates others that are of interest to the formation of engineers. More recently, project-led education as an integral strategy has been demonstrated in several European universities with impressive results. Students have a lower dropout rate, a lower period of adaptation to professional practice and better soft skills. While this implementation requires a general model change, at least at the faculty level, partial strategies applied in specific courses could pick up some of the positive aspects of these methodologies. In this paper, obtained results in a second-year Unit Operations course (grade of bioengineering) by applying this type of partial strategies are discussed. The student's acceptance was good, and both motivation and academic results improved significantly. It was observed a deeper and wider knowledge acquisition in the students. Teacher's workload increased, although, as there was a maximum of 25 students, it was manageable. It was concluded that transition from traditional to project-led learning strategies can be done within a subject without an educational model change at faculty or university level.

Therefore, because BIM is a collaborative working methodology, it is not possible to effectively teach BIM without the use of collaborative teamwork. Traditionally, teaching at universities has promoted individual student learning and development through lectures and examinations. The objective of this paper was to analyze the interactions in student teams when project- and team-based teaching methodologies are applied. To evaluate the interactions, we used the technique of social network analysis (SNA), and to evaluate the students' effort, we measured the number of hours dedicated to individual work and teamwork over 15 weeks. This research highlights the importance of collaborative work in the process of training students for careers in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry in BIM technology environments. The work was performed practically using real construction projects that were completed by student teams. The measurement of interactions was carried out using SNA, which allowed us to determine the density of interactions within each group. Teams that work more hours collaboratively than individually become better integrated, which is a feature that is also recognized in the individual achievements of their members.","[Herrera, Rodrigo F.; Munoz-La Rivera, Felipe; Vielma, Juan C.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Civil Engn, Ave Brasil 2147, Valparaiso 23662804, Spain; [Herrera, Rodrigo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Santiago, Chile; [Herrera, Rodrigo F.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia, Spain",,"Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Civil Engn, Ave Brasil 2147, Valparaiso 23662804, Spain.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Construct Engn & Management, Santiago, Chile.; Herrera, RF (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia, Spain.",mdrigo.herrera@pucv.cl; felipe.munoz@pucv.cl; juan.vielma@pucv.cl,"Mu–oz La Rivera, Felipe/AAX-9588-2021; Vielma-Perez, Juan C./C-6863-2018; Herrera, Rodrigo/N-3909-2017","Vielma-Perez, Juan C./0000-0001-5426-2215; Herrera, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5186-3154",,,,27,2,2,7,29,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",2643-9107,2643-9115,,J CIV ENG EDUC,J.

First, a survey was designed and implemented to examine teachers' beliefs about (a) L2 learning theories, (b) grammar instruction and communicative teaching, and (c) obstacles in implementing communicative teaching. In total, 498 school-level teachers completed the survey. Subsequently, nine teachers participated in focus-group interviews. The survey revealed overall support for teaching grammar via communicative methods. However, in the interview data, three types of conflicting beliefs were identified. First, theoretical conflicts pertained to the role that grammatical knowledge plays in developing communicative skills. Second, experiential conflicts were based on the teachers' unsuccessful experiences in using pair and group activities that resulted in a lack of student engagement. Third, contextual conflicts entailed beliefs about the compatibility of communicative teaching with the local socio-educational context. Teaching experiences positively and negatively mediated the conflicting beliefs. Overall, teachers' beliefs about how a L2 should be learned entailed a different set of beliefs from those about how a L2 can be taught. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The 40-item PHEEM questionnaire was translated from English to Spanish and retranslated to English. Content validity was tested by a focus group and minor differences in meaning were adjusted. The PHEEM was administered to clerks in years 6 and 7. Construct validity was carried out using exploratory factor analysis followed by a Varimax rotation. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha. Results: A total of 125 out of 220 students responded to the PHEEM. The overall response rate was 56.8% and compliances with each item ranged from 99.2% to 100%. Analyses indicate that five factors instrument accounting for 58% of the variance and internal consistency of the 40-item questionnaire is 0.955 (Cronbach's alpha). The 40-item questionnaire had a mean score of 98.21 +/- 21.2 (maximum score of 160).

By employing competence-based and performance-based measurements, the study also explores conceptual gaps regarding oral fluency between Second Language Acquisition and Language Testing research. The participants were 56 Japanese university-level learners of English and four native English speakers who rated the learners' oral fluency. The verbal protocol data showed that temporal aspects (e.g., pauses) and interaction-specific features (e.g., turn-taking) were interwoven, indicating that joint performance between the interactants is a constituent of the construct of interactional oral fluency. The statistical analyses revealed that learners' individual performance does not necessarily predict how they will perform in an interactional context, challenging the assumption that L2 specific processing is stably manifested in performance regardless of context.

Students in the treatment group are more satisfied with the course and have better grades, but the treatment effect varies as the semester progresses: small at the beginning, larger in the middle, and nonexistent in the final exam. Our hypothesis is that the treatment changed student effort. Students performed better under peer instruction and may have decided to decrease their effort toward the end of the semester. We present evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Additionally, students in the treatment group perceived that the most important part of the treatment was the greater interaction with the professor, and they reported studying less with their peers outside of class.","[Alcalde, Pilar; Nagel, Juan] Univ los Andes, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Av Monsenor Alvaro Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile",,"Alcalde, P (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Ciencias Econom & Empresariales, Av Monsenor Alvaro Portillo 12455, Santiago, Chile.",palcalde@uandes.cl,,,Universidad de los Andes' Fondo de Ayuda a la Investigacion (FAI),"The authors wish to thank the Universidad de los Andes' Fondo de Ayuda a la Investigacion (FAI) research grant for financial assistance.

The objective of this study aims to measure the prevalence of IA in Chilean medical students and its possible association with demographic variables and depressive symptoms. Methods First- to fifth-year undergraduate medical students at a medical school in Santiago de Chile answered a self-administered survey that included demographic data, the IAT scale, and the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to screen for IA and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results Three hundred eighty-four students participated, achieving a response rate of 69.8 %, of which 11.5 % were classified as problematic users according to the IAT. The authors found a statistical association between positive results on the IAT and positive scores on the GHQ-12, as well as with the male gender. Conclusion In this first study of IA in medical students, the authors found a rate of incidence similar to what has been published in the literature focusing on college students. Additionally, there was a positive association between emotional symptoms and other abuse behaviors.","[Enrique Berner, Juan] Hosp Clin Fuerza Aerea Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Santander, Jaime; Gomez, Teresita] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Maria Contreras, Ana] Hosp Psiquiatr Peral, Santiago, Chile",,"Berner, JE (corresponding author), Hosp Clin Fuerza Aerea Chile, Santiago, Chile.",jeberner@uc.cl,"Berner, Juan/AAI-1244-2021","Berner, Juan/0000-0003-2178-5161",,,,25,25,28,0,27,"AMER PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING, INC",ARLINGTON,"1000 WILSON BOULEVARD, STE 1825, ARLINGTON, VA 22209-3901 USA",1042-9670,1545-7230,,ACAD PSYCHIATR,Acad.

The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy Scale was applied. Results The results show an adequate reliability of the empathy measure (alpha = 0.819, omega = 0.928). A three-factor structure is evidenced by confirmatory factor analysis (chi(2)/df = 1.445, GFI = 0.952, RMSEA = 0.047) and adequate factor invariance between men and women. Women showed greater empathy on the global scale and in the perspective adoption dimension, with no gender differences found in the dimension Compassionate care and putting oneself in the other's shoes (POOS). The median empathy reaches 120 points. Below, are placed, the specialty of oral rehabilitation (Med = 114.5), surgery (Med = 117) and periodontics (Med. = 117.5).

In this sense, television programming has come to be redefined as educational, based on the audiences' needs in each of their different home environments. Reception studies show that various programs are frequently classified as educational programs, including news/journalistic programs, entertainment and fictional shows. This presents an opportunity for organizations and professionals of television to contribute to the improvement in the quality of life of their audience members, especially children and adolescents. With regards to the specific challenges that Latin American public television face, it is necessary to shift the axis from propaganda/situational to audiovisual programs that take into account the verbalized needs of various research projects in the region, especially for social groups that suffer not only financial disadvantages, but also those dealing with insecurity and ethnic exclusion.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile",,"Fuenzalida, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",vfuenza@vtr.net,,,,,,17,11,14,0,25,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2011,18,36,,,,,15,24,,10.3916/C36-2011-02-01,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,716RY,WOS:000286992400003,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

This mixed-methods study presents an alternative look at classroom participation by investigating the relationship between second language (L2) thoughts and L2 speech in German as a foreign language learners in a language program in the United States. At four points during an academic semester, 16 students answered an in-class survey that aimed at recording students' estimations of how much of their thoughts had been formulated in the L2 and how much of their speech had been articulated in the L2. A small subset of these students participated in individual stimulated recall interviews to gather their own reflections on their thought processes and L2 speech production. Results show that students' L2 speech production is conditioned by a complex interplay of variables, which results in a mismatch between self-reported L2 thoughts and L2 speech. Several explanations derived from interview data are offered to account for this divergence, such as motivational tendencies, misperceptions of L2 use, the production of rehearsed speech, metalinguistic thoughts in the first language, and conceptions of silence as a valid form of participation. Pedagogical implications are discussed.","[Bernales, Carolina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Dept Linguist, English Linguist & Language Acquisit 2, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Bernales, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Dept Linguist, English Linguist & Language Acquisit 2, Valparaiso, Chile.",,"Bernales, Carolina/AAT-1295-2021","Bernales, Carolina/0000-0002-9382-7183",,,,52,5,5,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0015-718X,1944-9720,,FOREIGN LANG ANN,Foreign Lang.

The results indicate that the educational problems linked to both the identity and the autonomy of the profession, the cultural value associated to professional practice, the existence and reach of the Teachers Associations, political and economic peculiarities, and the considerable influence exercised by Europe and the United States, are all aspects that make Latin American journalism different journalism in the rest of the world.

The aim of this study was to compare the self-reported perceptions of each student-centred teaching technique amongst a group of dental students as well as resultant quiz scores after each teaching technique. Material and Methods During the first semester of 2017, all year-3 (N = 88) Semiology and year-5 (N = 71) Oral Surgery students participated in weekly seminars in which teams of students from both cohorts were given an actual clinical case to study; a diagnosis and treatment plan would be rendered, and an oral case presentation would be presented to the rest of the class. In the second semester, the same students tried to solve similar clinical cases using the fishbowl training format. A course coordinator provided final feedback, and the session culminated with a quiz. Students were invited to provide quantitative and qualitative perceptions whilst quiz scores obtained during seminar and fishbowl teaching formats were compared. Results and Discussion A total of 97 (61%) seminar and 92 (58%) fishbowl students provided insights regarding these teaching techniques. Both cohorts believed the fishbowl format allowed them to be actively involved. However, only year-3 students gave the fishbowl format a significantly higher score than the seminar format, considering it an attractive format that allowed them to learn. In contrast, year-5 students believed the seminars met their expectations better than the fishbowl format. Interesting clinical cases as well as the final round of feedback were qualitative themes reported by both cohorts. The mean seminar and fishbowl quiz scores were statistically significant different for year-3 students (P < 0.0001), but not for year-5 students (P = 0.09). Conclusions These findings suggest that a more structured small-group learning-teaching format can be implemented for younger students whilst at the same time allowing more flexible organisation for senior students.","[Tricio, Jorge; Montt, Juan; Orsini, Cesar] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Fac Dev Off, Santiago, Chile; [Gracia, Benjamin; Pampin, Francisco; Quinteros, Camilo; Salas, Macarena; Soto, Reinaldo; Fuentes, Nelson] Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile",,"Tricio, J (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Dent, Fac Dev Off, Santiago, Chile.",jtricio@uandes.cl,"Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019","Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828; Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; SOTO, REINALDO/0000-0003-3019-5083","Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [11150123]","This study was funded by a grant from the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) #11150123 to J.T.",,32,3,3,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Although these digital resources support and motivate them to learn, these are also a source of continuous distraction. This research analyzes the impact of studying with handwritten notes, WhatsApp, YouTube and searching the Internet in academic performance, through a mixed method that combines 3 I focus groups and a survey of 7217 students from 12 to 18 years of age in Chile. The results of the focus groups show that the positive impact of technologies in learning would depend on the students' motivation for learning, their ability to efficiently control and manage the available digital resources, and their capacity to search and evaluate information on the Internet. The survey concludes that those who study with their notes more frequently have better academic performance, whereas those who frequently study with YouTube and WhatsApp have a lower GPA, with no significant differences when it comes to internet browsing. These results reinforce the need raised by scholars to generate policies that promote digital literacy both inside and outside the school.","[Halpern, Daniel; Pina, Martina; Ortega-Gunckel, Constanza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile",,"Halpern, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comunicac, Santiago, Chile.",dmhalper@uc.cl; mipina@uc.cl; cortega1@uc.c1,,"Ortega Gunckel, Constanza/0000-0001-9182-3827; Pina, Martina/0000-0003-4847-4734",,,,39,5,5,3,15,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL 1,2020,28,64,,,,,39,48,,10.3916/C64-2020-04,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,LZ3MY,WOS:000541133800004,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

This article reports on a research project that investigated how a set core practices are integrated into the Methods courses and practicums in Chilean language teacher education programs for English as a foreign language (EFL). The study was framed by a two-stage, sequential data collection strategy based on a questionnaire (n = 48) and semi-structured interviews (n = 21) to university-based, Chilean English teacher educators. The questionnaire identified teaching practices in use, whilst the interviews sought to understand how teacher educators taught these identified teaching practices, as well as the rationale for these choices. Two practices - facilitating target language comprehensibility and building discourse communities - emerged as the most prominent practices. Primarily, these practices were taught through modelling, decomposing, planning and simulations. However, potentially more complex issues around translanguaging, inclusion strategies and cultural practices tended to be framed using more directive and teacher-centred pedagogies. The outcomes of the study highlight several critical issues for L2 teacher education: the relative balance between theoretical and practical domains often compounded by the lack of meaningful opportunities for authentic classroom practice; and the significant challenges faced by teacher educators by engaging in 'practice' in a crowded program structure.","[Barahona, Malba] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Darwin, Stephen] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile",,"Barahona, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",maria.barahona@uc.cl,"; Barahona, Malba/L-7610-2016","Darwin, Stephen/0000-0002-8271-9451; Barahona, Malba/0000-0003-4587-5794","ANID/FONDECYT [1210867, 1210392]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by ANID/FONDECYT 1210867 and ANID/FONDECYT 1210392.",,33,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1362-1688,1477-0954,,LANG TEACH RES,Lang.

During the 2020 pandemic, school closures have posed additional challenges to educators seeking to engage learners and provide egalitarian access to learning opportunities. Approach: This case study documents a collaborative materials design process when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Chilean schools into remote lessons for a whole school year. The collaboration was based on a small professional learning network consisting of two pre-service teachers and two teacher educators. Two questions were posed: (1) What learning and circumstantial needs had to be considered for materials design and for the process of making the materials accessible to a diverse group of Year-9 EFL learners? (2) What were the benefits and challenges for this networked learning system when searching for solutions? Findings: The combination of different access modes to materials, including paper-based worksheets and social networking, and the provision of internet access to facilitate video conferences, helped to overcome some but not all of the limitations caused by the lack of political commitment to offer solutions at a macro level. Based on a framework that combined principles of Differentiated Instruction, Universal Design for Learning, multimodality and bilingual support, the team developed materials at an appropriate level for most students. However, difficulties regarding differentiation between different learner levels persisted. Value: This study sheds light on the affordances and challenges of a collaborative materials design process in which educators join perspectives to provide materials for greater educational justice in FL classrooms.","[Glas, Katharina; Catalan, Erica; Donner, Marcel; Donoso, Carla] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Av El Bosque 1290,Ed ILCL,Of 7-9, Vina Del Mar, Chile",,"Glas, K (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Literatura & Ciencias Lenguaje, Av El Bosque 1290,Ed ILCL,Of 7-9, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",katharina.glas@pucv.cl,,"Glas, Katharina/0000-0002-8214-1725",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [PMI UCV1897],This work was supported by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (PMI UCV1897).,,40,0,0,5,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-1229,1750-1237,,INNOV LANG LEARN TEA,Innov.

Researching this age group is relevant given that adolescence is a key period in people's civic socialization. This study explores how 13 to 17 year old Chileans consume news, in a multiple-platform, convergent and mobile media context. There are few studies that focus on the information habits of this particular age group. Using a quantitative self-administered questionnaire applied to 2,273 high school adolescents from four different regions in the country, this paper analyses participants' news consumption habits, their interest in news, their perception about the importance of different topics, and their motivations to being informed. The results show that surveyed teenagers access information mainly via social media like Facebook, to the detriment of traditional media. These adolescents are least interested in traditional politics, but they think this is the most prominent topic in the news. Their motivations to consume news have to do with their wish to be able to defend their points of view and deliver information to others. Also, they think that their portrayal in the news agenda is both inadequate and negative. These findings suggest that the news industry has a pending debt with young audiences.","[Condeza, Rayen; Bachmann, Ingrid; Mujica, Constanza] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Commun, Santiago, Chile",,"Condeza, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Commun, Santiago, Chile.",rcondeza@uc.cl; ibachman@uc.cl; mcmujica@uc.cl,,,,,,47,22,23,2,49,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL 1,2014,22,43,,,,,55,64,,10.3916/C43-2014-05,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,AK0UB,WOS:000338130200007,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

As recently reviewed by Curren (Oxf Rev Educ 36(5):543-559, 2010), most of this attention aligns with the virtue ethics movement where themes like moral development in education, and the inquiry on human flourishing as the aim of education are prevalent. For sources, this scholarship relies heavily and extensively on the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics' Book VIII where Aristotle develops his single, clearly defined account of education. Among the short list of scholars who include Poetics in their research, their work seems to return to issues of morality and education (Carr in J Aesthet Educ 44(3):1-15, 2010; Gupta in J Aesthet Educ 44(4):60-80, 2010). This paper is an attempt to rediscover Aristotle's insights on the peculiar type of learning that the arts seem to favor. In order to carry on this investigation, I will first guide my argument towards Aristotle's remarks on poiesis. Then, I will focus on what constitutes the heart of poiesis, that is, mimesis. I will pay special attention to Aristotle's consideration of both poiesis and mimesis as ultimately dealing with what he calls possibility. I will argue that learning in the arts entails the coming together of these three qualities. This would be a way of learning characterized by seeing human likenesses emerge as such in our interactions with artworks.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile",,"Marini, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul 7820436, Region Metropol, Chile.",gmarini@uc.cl,,"Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151",,,,16,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

Amid the increasing research on mindsets in the L2 field, two issues warrant further research to improve our understanding of how mindsets affect L2 learning. First, research has largely been product-oriented and mindsets' impacts on learning processes are under-investigated. Second, the research has rarely examined actual behaviors, especially in an interactional context. Participants were university-level EFL learners in Chile (N = 42). They were paired according to their mindsets, resulting in three pairing patterns and seven pairs for each pattern: Growth-Growth (G-G), Growth-Fixed (G-F), and Fixed-Fixed (F-F). During regular classes, the pairs engaged in decision-making tasks. Two propensities were focused upon. First, problem-solving behaviors were operationalized as language-related episodes (LREs) in which learners worked together to solve linguistic issues. Second, collaborative learning was analyzed using Storch's framework of the degree of collaboration. In total, 384 LREs were identified. The comparisons among the three pairing patterns showed that (a) growth-mindset learners tended to initiate LREs, (b) F-F pairs engaged in the least number of LREs, and (c) G-G pairs resolved the most LREs proportionally. However, growth-mindset learners did not necessarily engage in collaborative interaction and some exhibited negative behaviors (e.g. negative perfectionism). Together, the study suggests that while growth-mindset positively contributes to problem solving, the individually-held beliefs do not necessarily translate to social contexts such as peer interaction in the classroom.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,,"Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; PIA from the the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CIE160009],This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) awarded to the author.,,35,0,0,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-1229,1750-1237,,INNOV LANG LEARN TEA,Innov.

Two intact university-level classes were assigned to the experimental (n= 26) and control (n= 24) groups. The vision intervention focused on entrepreneurship to trigger and enhance vision of the business-major students and incorporated group work relating to future L2 use in the global market. The results show that the intervention positively affected theideal L2 selfandinternational posture,but theought-to L2 selfandintended effortwere not affected. Also, the experimental group increased target language use over time. The correlational analyses of the motivational and behavioral variables showed that only after the intervention was target language use positively correlated with the ideal L2 self, but negatively with the ought-to L2 self.

Lately, researchers have given increased attention to digital texts. Although progress on these topics has been made as reported in published research, there is yet incomplete information regarding readers' habits and opinions at university and professional levels. This study describes the self-reported habits of university students belonging to two disciplinary domains (Human Sciences and Economic and Business Sciences) regarding reading on paper or on digital media for three purposes: academic, entertainment, and information seeking. The results reveal that the readers' preferences vary according to the three purposes. These readers reported using different media but had a clear preference for paper; they also reported distinguishing between cognitive processes (memory, comprehension, and learning), with the discipline to which they belonged having no radical effect on their preferences. All of this leads us to conclude that currently there exists a generation in transition, a 'Gutenberg-Google' generation, which still recognizes the relevance of paper, in particular for academic purposes.","[Parodi, Giovanni; Moreno-de Leon, Tomas] Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Julio, Cristobal] Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Linguist, Valparaiso, Chile; [Burdiles, Gina] Catholic Univ Most Holy Concept, Concepcion, Chile",,"Parodi, G (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",giovanni.parodi@pucv.cl; tomas.moreno.d@mail.pucv.cl; cristobal.julio@pucv.cl; gburdiles@ucsc.cl,"Julio, Crist—bal/P-7265-2019; Moreno-de Le—n, Tom‡s/AAA-4036-2022","Julio, Crist—bal/0000-0002-4723-0271; Moreno-de Le—n, Tom‡s/0000-0003-4931-971X; Burdiles Fernandez, Gina/0000-0001-5164-8382",FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170623],Research Project FONDECYT 1170623 (2017-2020) Are there different routes for reading multi-semiotic texts in professionals of different disciplinary backgrounds: Philosophy and economics?

J,"Marini, G",,,,"Marini, Guillermo",,,An Introduction to Everyday Aesthetics in Education,studies in philosophy and education,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sensory perception; Everyday aesthetics; School aesthetic matrixes; Space and place in school; Pedagogical experience,,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce everyday aesthetics in education. First, it presents everyday aesthetics as a subdiscipline within philosophical aesthetics, that revisits sensory perception as the backdrop of all experience, claims ordinary life is a proper venue for aesthetic inquiry, and problematizes the impact aesthetic preferences have on habitual decisions. Second, the paper argues that among the diverse matters students learn in school, they learn-explicitly or implicitly-what and how to perceive, as well as the pedagogical purposes of daily perception. School models the relationships that students will develop between what they perceive, what they think about it, and how they act accordingly. Next, the paper elaborates on the notions of school aesthetic matrixes and space and place in school. School aesthetic matrixes refer to perceptual patterns that allow characterizing relationships between daily perception and the pedagogical project of a school. They manifest through expressions such asprison school,home school,mall school, etc. Space and place in school allude to concomitant experiences, of corporeal basis, that allow describing how we inhabit the world. What distinguishes them is the approach each one gives to the senses and the body. The paper concludes by calling attention to the comprehension and role of perception in education, urging to mind the aesthetic-pedagogical character that students develop throughout 12 years of schooling. Ultimately, the key relationships we develop with ourselves, others, and the world, entail a basic perceptual dimension that can be educated to become more purposefully and integrally present in life.","[Marini, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Marini, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",gmarini@uc.cl,,"Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151",Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT [1210808],This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT Regular 1210808.,,27,2,2,2,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

This paper presents a reference framework for the professional teacher identity and analyses the linguistic structures and persuasion strategies present in three documents that directly question this group of teachers, building an identity profile of them. Discursive mechanisms are identified which legitimise identity traits. The way in which said productions influence the thoughts and actions of their readership is also analysed. A documentary study design is used based on critical documentary analysis. The investigation shows breaks in the discourse and an existing tension between the mission and the profession, underlining that the Catholic religion teacher is first and foremost an evangeliser. The performance capacity of this discourse on the listeners is discussed along with the effect of the almost complete absence of references to teaching professionalism and the possible influence on the development and results of the subject.","[Vargas-Herrera, Francisco; Moya-Marchant, Loreto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ecclesiast Theol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Vargas-Herrera, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Vargas-Herrera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ecclesiast Theol, Valparaiso, Chile.; Vargas-Herrera, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Valparaiso, Chile.",francisco.vargas@pucv.cl,"Vargas-Herrera, Francisco/L-8516-2018; Moya-Marchant, Loreto/Y-3997-2018","Vargas-Herrera, Francisco/0000-0002-0718-6616; Moya-Marchant, Loreto/0000-0003-4123-579X","Stipendienwerk Lateinamerika-Deutschland (Icala, Consejo Valparaiso, Chile)","This work was supported by Stipendienwerk Lateinamerika-Deutschland (Icala, Consejo Valparaiso, Chile).",,36,3,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-6200,1740-7931,,BRIT J RELIG EDUC,Brit.

This qualitative multiple-case study explored the links between spontaneous use of help options and identification of input text characteristics of dissemination talks. Working with authentic video clip segments in six individual sessions, 13 high-intermediate learners of English from Chile interacted with pre-, while-, and post-listening exercises hosted in a purpose-built listening environment that supports a range of help options. Data was collected through an entry-survey, task-directed listening questionnaires, screen capturing software, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the use of help options was instrumental for participants producing informed responses, and allowed for the identification of general lexis, technical vocabulary, and fast speech rate as comprehension-impeding characteristics of dissemination talks.

The classroom intervention was designed to promote collaborative learning and to train learners to provide CF to each other. Participants were university-level learners in 4 required English classes in Japan (N=167), each assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions. While all experimental classes were given peer interaction instruction, 2 classes were given CF training (prompts or recasts). Another class served as the control group. Questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention and selected learners (n=36) were interviewed. The quantitative (factor-analysis and matched-samples t-tests) and qualitative (grounded theory methodology) analyses revealed that, while learners held positive beliefs about peer interaction and peer CF from the onset, the intervention facilitated trust in their classmates as learning resources, and those who were given CF training displayed an increased willingness to and confidence in providing CF. Also, 2 classroom-specific variables emerged for the intervention to be effective on language development: a collaborative classroom environment and positive social relationships between learners.","Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,"Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019","Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",,,,116,53,53,10,115,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-7902,1540-4781,,MOD LANG J,Mod.

Teaching styles were identified according to the Grasha-Riechmann Teaching Style Survey (1996) while learner anxiety was measured through the Foreign Language Class Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986). Results suggest that certain teaching styles or style clusters seem to provoke more anxiety, especially when accompanied by other factors such as gender, grade point average and past performance.

An important breakthrough in this respect has been Google Translate (GT), one of the most widely used online translators (OTs). Research suggests that when teachers are aware of the limitations of OTs and provide adequate guidance to use them, they can become effective pedagogical devices. However, most of the studies conducted in EFL settings focus on adult learners' perceptions toward OTs or rely on holistic rubrics to assess writing quality. Thus, the present study sought to apply a linguistic approach to the analysis of writing output produced by high school learners using GT. Sixty-one high-school EFL learners were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (GT without instruction, GT with instruction, and a group with no access to GT). Writing quality was assessed in terms of T-unit length, syntactic complexity, and accuracy in a narrative task. Results suggest that syntactic complexity and accuracy scores were higher in the groups that had access to GT. The possibilities for GT as an effective learning tool are discussed, while emphasizing the need for learners to receive adequate instruction on how to utilize it. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to analyze the factors associated with postretirement work in Chile, a country characterized by a strong persistence of a male-breadwinner model endorsed by deeply-rooted traditional gender roles, and at the same time characterized by a dual-earner model strongly encouraged by a neoliberal system. Relying on a gendered life course perspective and using a nationally representative survey, we conducted logistic regression analyses to explore how a number of cumulative advantages and disadvantages (such as work trajectory, job satisfaction, and caregiving duties) shape working beyond legal retirement age and the intrinsic motivation to continue working among economically active older adults in Chile. One of the main findings of the present study is that intrinsic motivation to continue working was a remarkably significant predictor of postretirement work among older Chilean adults, especially among women. The results also suggest that even though older women are motivated to continue working, the national labor market is unlikely to offer such possibility. The findings of this study have implications for practice in the sense that they demonstrate the imperative need for organizations to focus on intrinsic motivation-related factors in striving to improve employees' willingness to stay within the company after the state pension age.","[Galkute, Milda; Herrera, M.

The objective was also to determine whether there are differential profiles in the use and consumption of media related to the future role of these profiles in the audiovisual literacy of the students. To do this, a non-random sample was used comprising 881 Pedagogy students of both genders studying at seven universities in southern and central Chile. The media consumption questionnaire was used for data collection. In general, the distribution of preferences by gender and degree course falls short of representing idiosyncrasy in terms of the media, and reflects outside realities that do not permit participation in citizenry processes to be strengthened in media consumers. In short, the biggest problem is that future teachers do not seem to have the tools that allow them to manage the work of audiovisual literacy since they themselves have difficulties in differentiating between information and persuasion in advertising messages.","[del Valle, Carlos] Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Languages Literature & Commun, Temuco, Chile; [Denegri, Marianela] Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Psychol, Fac Educ Social Sci & Humanities, Temuco, Chile",,"del Valle, C (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera Temuco, Dept Languages Literature & Commun, Temuco, Chile.",delvalle@ufro.cl; mdenegri@ufro.cl; d.chavez02@ufromail.cl,"LI, Yun-lu/AAO-3325-2020; Ch‡vez, David/AAT-4412-2020; Denegri, Marianela/AAU-9898-2021","Ch‡vez, David/0000-0003-4700-0588;",,,,49,5,5,2,36,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2012,19,38,,,,,183,191,,10.3916/C38-2012-03-10,,,9,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,895MX,WOS:000300501400022,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

Forty-four Grade 3 students (8-9 years old) from two intact classes participated in the study. The learners in Class A (n = 23) engaged in a series of activities designed to increase their metacognition in relation to WTC, while Class B (n = 21) served as the control. Three outcome measures were explored in the pre-post design: (1) WTC questionnaire; (2) second language (L2) production during group work; and (3) empty WTC pyramids that the participants drew before and after the intervention. In addition, post-intervention interviews were conducted to understand the learners' metacognitive knowledge of oral communication. The results showed that the intervention did not have an observable impact on the learners' WTC. However, their metacognitive knowledge of oral communication was heightened after the intervention. The behavioral data showed that the experimental participants produced the target language more and that group members started to share turns more evenly. The study concludes that metacognitive instruction can be a useful pedagogical tool to improve L2 learners' metacognition as well as classroom participations patterns, even with young learners whose metacognition can be obscure or inaccurate.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Dussuel Lam, Claudia] Colegio Cumbres, Las Condes, Chile",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,,"Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; PIA from the CONICYT [CIE160009],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533), as well as the PIA (CIE160009) received from the CONICYT, awarded to the first author.",,63,6,6,7,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1362-1688,1477-0954,,LANG TEACH RES,Lang.

This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission rules that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu's conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families' advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes.","[Carrasco, Alejandro; Hernandez, Macarena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Honey, Ngaire; Oyarzun, Juan de Dios] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Justicia Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Carrasco, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",ajcarras@uc.cl,,"Oyarzun, Juan de Dios/0000-0002-8168-076X","Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile, ANID PIA [CIE160007]","This article was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile, ANID PIA CIE160007.",,47,3,3,6,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-5692,1465-3346,,BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC,Br.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of students and personnel at a Chilean dental school during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods This phenomenological descriptive qualitative study reported staff and students' experiences during the pandemic through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. These were recorded on audio and video with a digital platform. Three researchers then transcribed and analyzed the recordings and codified the answers into categories to determine the emerging topics until a saturation point was reached. Results The core emerging themes among the staff group were (1) change in the personal/professional life balance, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) staff perceptions of students' learning experiences, and (4) concerns about the future. For students, the themes were (1) changes in the learning process, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) interpersonal relationships, and (4) concerns about the future. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of learning for our dental school staff and students. Even though online learning has been a useful tool for delivering didactic (theoretical) concepts, it has been unable to replace conventional education, including skills training. Students and teachers reported being overwhelmed at the beginning of the pandemic, but they have shown remarkable adaptability and resilience during this period.","[Prieto, Diego; Tricio, Jorge; Caceres, Felipe; Param, Fernanda; Melendez, Catalina; Vasquez, Pamela; Prada, Pamela] Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Av Mons Alvaro Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile",,"Prieto, D (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Odontol, Av Mons Alvaro Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile.",djprieto@mluandes.cl,"Prieto, Diego/AAJ-4600-2021; Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013","Prieto, Diego/0000-0002-3691-0212; Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828; Caceres, Felipe/0000-0003-1276-8212; VASQUEZ, PAMELA/0000-0003-0573-2975",,,,17,3,3,4,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

We present qualitative empirical evidence on the use of mass media and digital technologies from the digital convergence of media, the industry and the resulting complementary formats. Television, in particular, has experienced a process of changing its formats and expressive content by delivering interactivity, facilitating the expression of subjects by means of different technological devices. So from the perspective of the subject, it is observed that the new technological devices and their new grammars are utilized provided they contribute with meaning to his daily practice and biographical trajectory. Nevertheless, digital inclusion policies have focused only on maximizing access to equipment and digital literacy associated to technology applications and not to the narrative skills of the subjects. It is therefore necessary to generate new concepts that allow new methodological guidelines, in communication and education academic processes, to promote the use of new emerging digital spaces for communicational empowered citizens, that is, from competent to tell (expressive skills) to more specifically, tell oneself (as an individual) and tell us (collectively). Finally, these will be the expressive spaces of the new television with citizen's expressions, fostered by converging elements of digital technology.","[Phillippi, Alejandra; Avendano, Claudio] Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Escuela Periodismo, Santiago, Chile",,"Phillippi, A (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales Santiago, Escuela Periodismo, Santiago, Chile.",alejandra.phillippi@udp.cl; claudio.avendano@udp.cl,"Phillippi, Alejandra/AAB-6164-2022",,,,,27,9,9,0,16,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2011,18,36,,,,,61,68,,10.3916/C36-2011-02-06,,,8,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,716RY,WOS:000286992400008,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

The role of the medical schools in reducing health inequality has not been systematically explored.Methods: A qualitative framework method was used to explore the meaning, barriers, and facilitators of the concept of the social accountability of medical schools in Latin America. Twenty nine Latin American academic leaders from seven countries participated in an expert panel discussion. The Atlas ti.7 software was used to analyze the information.Results: Social accountability was identified as a core dimension of the mission of medical schools. The panel identified a gradient of three dimensions associated with social accountability. First, a formative dimension related to student selection, curricular structure and community based learning initiatives. Second, a societal dimension associated with institutional mission, community partnerships, and social research projects. Third, a political dimension related with involvement in health policies and primary care engagement. Lack of accreditation standards was identified as a main barrier to improve social accountability.Conclusions: Latin American leaders consider that medical schools should develop specific formative, societal, and political initiatives in order to be socially accountable.","[Puschel, Klaus; Riquelme, Arnoldo; Moore, Philippa; Rojas, Viviana; Perry, Andres; Sapag, Jaime C.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile",,"Sapag, JC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago 8330077, Chile.; Sapag, JC (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Fac Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Diagonal Paraguay 362, Santiago 8330077, Chile.",jsapag@med.puc.cl,,,"School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","This work was supported by School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.",,25,5,5,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-159X,1466-187X,,MED TEACH,Med.

To this end, the concepts of the doctor-patient relationship and doctor-patient communication are revisited to explore their therapeutic dimensions. The concept of TP is defined, and existing literature about the relationship between that concept, the therapeutic alliance, and mindfulness is reviewed, alongside an examination of related concepts that have developed within nursing and medicine. We conclude that TP emerges as a transtheoretical concept that can be integrated into our understanding of the doctor-patient encounter to improve both doctor-patient communication and the doctor-patient relationship. The way in which the biomedical model may limit a present medicine is discussed, and the means of integrating such a model of doctor-patient encounter into medical training and practice is analyzed.","[Krogh, Edwin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Krogh, Edwin] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Psychodynam Psychotherapy, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro; Schmidt, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Valdivia, Chile; [Schmidt, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Clin Psychol, Valdivia, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Psicol, Funct Anal Clin & Hlth Contexts, Valdivia, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Millennium Inst Res Depress & Personal MIDAP, Santiago, Chile; [Langer, Alvaro] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies Nervous Syst CISNe, Valdivia, Chile",,"Krogh, E (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.; Krogh, E (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Neurociencias Clin, Fac Med, Psychodynam Psychotherapy, Campus Isla Teja S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.",edwin.krogh@uach.cl,"Hubsher, Marshall/Q-1825-2019","Hubsher, Marshall/0000-0002-9775-0400; Hubsher, Marshall/0000-0002-7315-8947; Krogh, Edwin/0000-0002-2042-3137","Innovation and Competitiveness (FIC) of the Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, through the Millennium Scientific Initiative [IS130005]","A.L. is partially supported for Innovation and Competitiveness (FIC) of the Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, through the Millennium Scientific Initiative, Grant No. IS130005.",,60,4,4,17,111,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0894-1912,1554-558X,,J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH,J.

Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing non-explicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization No+APF. From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students. 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headiness and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media's brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization No+APF. The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between critical-thinking abilities and having a defined opinion.","[Vernier, Matthieu; Scheihing, Eliana] Univ Austral Chile Valdivia, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile; [Carcamo, Luis] Univ Chile Valdivia, Inst Comunicac Social, Valdivia, Chile",,"Vernier, M (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile Valdivia, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile.",mvernier@inf.uach.cl; lcarcamo@uach.cl; escheihi@inf.uach.cl,"Carcamo-Ulloa, Luis/L-5545-2019; Vernier, Matthieu/W-9620-2019; Ulloa, Luis/AAE-8751-2019; C‡rcamo-Ulloa, Luis/ABF-6797-2020","Vernier, Matthieu/0000-0002-3265-4709; Ulloa, Luis/0000-0002-7702-7549; C‡rcamo-Ulloa, Luis/0000-0003-0633-9606; Scheihing, Eliana/0000-0003-1801-9167",,,,35,8,9,3,24,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN 1,2018,26,54,,,,,101,110,,10.3916/C54-2018-10,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,FS2GD,WOS:000419595900005,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

However, the physical presence of the subjects and the body remain something primordial and irreplaceable in traditional educational processes. Thus, it is often assumed that virtuality is opposed to the corporeal reality of the subjects involved in teaching, learning and studying. In this paper we aim to critically challenge this assumption by addressing the phenomenon of virtuality in a more original sense: as a fundamental dimension of corporeality itself. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological insights, we argue that the experience of the virtual is inherently embodied and fully real. We understand corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena. At the same time, this leads us to rethink the digital as only one possible medium in which virtuality can appear as inherent to embodied experience. We develop our phenomenological approach in three instances. First, we question and bracket two common assumptions about corporeality. From our critical perspective, assumptions about a disembodied digitality and a devirtualized corporeality represent extremes within which educational discourses currently move. Second, we address the inherent virtuality of embodied experience. We outline the heuristic concept of the virtual body (Merleau-Ponty) to describe corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena that encompass extension, intercorporeality and intermediality. Finally, we make some remarks on the relationships of corporeality and virtuality considering the challenges of digital education.","[Willatt, Carlos; Manuel Flores, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Theory & Policy, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile",,"Willatt, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Educ Theory & Policy, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",cjwillat@uc.cl,,"Willatt, Carlos/0000-0003-3357-5073",Chilean National Agency for Research and Development [3200018],This work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development through the Grant ANID FONDECYT Postdoctoral 3200018.,,73,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

Given the importance of coping to optimal mental health, healthy ways of coping with losses related to the aging process are identified and characterized. Thirty-six semistructured in-depth interviews were carried out with adults aged 65 years and older in order to understand experiences that they assessed as losses associated with aging. Their ways of coping and their levels of subjective well-being were documented. The qualitative analysis yielded was complemented by quantitative analysis. Six types of losses were identified: health and/or physical capacity, quality of emotional relationships, death of loved ones, social integration, quality of life in a material sense, and quality of life in a cognitive sense. As determined by both the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the way of coping most strongly linked with high levels of subjective well-being was that of accommodation, followed by different ways of coping consistent with each type of loss. Healthy ways of coping are essential to maintaining subjective well-being in old age, with the most effective being identified. The mode of observation employed may be applied and improved in future research studies. Meanwhile, the results are relevant to prevention and intervention initiatives targeted at the mental health of elderly populations.","Univ Alberto Hurtado, Program Senior Citizens & Mental Hlth, Ctr Community Studies & Care, Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez,Ctr Psychol Counsel, Santiago 8330225, Chile",,"Dockendorff, DCT (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Program Senior Citizens & Mental Hlth, Ctr Community Studies & Care, Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez,Ctr Psychol Counsel, Gen Jofre 462, Santiago 8330225, Chile.",daniela.thumala@gmail.com,,,,,,30,12,16,1,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0360-1277,1521-0472,,EDUC GERONTOL,Educ.

Nonetheless, the discussion concerning local culture and ELT materials has not yet reached textbooks designed for children in their first years of English language learning. This study aims to explore whether the ELT materials used in the first two years of compulsory English language education in Chile, 5th- and 6th- grades, include representations of the local culture, and whether these materials are being localised by the teachers. Through a content analysis of a corpus of four ELT materials approved and distributed in public schools from 2013 to 2016 and from 2017 to 2019 and the examination of 63 teachers' perceptions on localisation of ELT coursebooks, the article argues that the ELT materials analysed include representations of local culture specifically associated with 'national geography' and 'stereotypes and national identity'. Although teachers reported that they were unsure about whether the cultural representations of the materials facilitated learning, they claimed to include representations of local references when adapting the textbooks. The article concludes by suggesting that the ELT materials locally produced demand urgent review. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Several studies have shown that distance to school is one of the main determinants of school choice, but challenges to address endogeneity issues remain. To address these concerns, in this paper I take advantage of the construction of a new subway line in Santiago, Chile, that crosses a large area of the city previously unconnected to the subway network. I provide convincing evidence to show that the introduction of the subway line was arguably exogenous for families living close to the new subway stations. With rich administrative data, which includes all high-school seniors that registered to take a national university entrance exam, I use a repeated cross-section difference-in-differences analysis and find that (i) students near the new subway stations travel significantly farther to school than students who live in nearby areas with no subway stations, and (ii) that students near the subway are willing to travel slightly farther to attend schools that perform better in standardized tests, although this effect is small and only significant for language test scores. This set of results is particularly informative in the context of the broader school-choice debate, contributing causal evidence on the effects of transit access on school-choice.","[Herskovic, Luis] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile",,"Herskovic, L (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.",luis.herskovic@uai.cl,,"Herskovic, Luis/0000-0002-8761-1669",Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [ANID/FONDAP/15130009],"I am very grateful to Ofer Malamud, Anjali Adukia and Dan Black for all their comments and suggestions.

However, the digital revolution has transformed the ways to encourage reading and learning about books. People who generate and share content about books on social networks are the so-called booktokers, influencers on TikTok who have become an emerging phenomenon in this connected society. However, there is scarce research that studies them in depth. Therefore, it is crucial to explore booktokers to understand them better and to assess why they accept and use technologies to generate and share content about books on TikTok. This paper intends to explore the acceptance and use of TikTok to generate and share content about books on this social network as a booktoker. For this, a qualitative methodology of semi-structured interviews with thirteen Latin American booktokers was used. The analysis was developed through a thematic analysis based on the UTAUT2 theory to explain the findings. The results indicated the categories: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, price value, and a new identified category related to the generation of community and networks. This study constitutes one of the pioneering works in the exploration of the booktoker phenomenon.","[Guinez-Cabrera, Nataly; Mansilla-Obando, Katherine] Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",,"Guinez-Cabrera, N (corresponding author), Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile.",,,"Mansilla Obando, Katherine/0000-0003-4273-4259",,,,46,0,0,15,15,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR,2022,30,71,,,,,,,,10.3916/C71-2022-09,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,YO1WE,WOS:000747736200009,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

However, there are social, contextual and individual variables that influence students' decisions to speak up or remain silent when the situation calls for spoken participation in class. This mixed-methods study investigates L2 use and classroom participation practices of German-as-foreign-language learners; their predictions and expectations regarding their own participation during the foreign language class; and the reasons behind their actions according to their own accounts. Students answered an in-class survey administered at different points during four lessons sampled throughout an academic semester. Using stimulated recall interviews, focal participants were asked to explain their reasoning for speaking or remaining silent at specific moments in the class meetings. Findings revealed a link between predicted and self-reported participation that developed progressively as a result of a combination of factors, such as alignment with classroom norms, the teachers expectations, students-speaking goals, and motivation among others. These findings provide a new understanding of WTC and bear pedagogical implications for teaching. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to examine in-service and pre-service teachers' cognitive processes while lesson planning with the use of the think-aloud protocol. Frequency and content analysis were used as data analysis techniques. A total of 28 English teachers and 86 student teachers had to plan a lesson verbalizing their thoughts while being recorded. After this task was fulfilled, the recordings were transcribed and the transcripts analyzed and coded. This data was later organized into categories and subcategories, and counted to analyze how often various cognitive processes appeared. The findings show that while both groups of participants (in-service and pre-service teachers) displayed a wide range of cognitive processes while planning, pre-service teachers were more likely to plan every aspect of the class in detail. However, in-service teachers were more concise at the moment of planning. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This discussion seeks to complement the functionalist perspective of communication studies in the field of advertising content analysis by incorporating a discursive focus, taking into account contextual issues that may condition the interpretation of messages. Firstly, discourse analysis was used as a means of exploring social representations, identifying stereotypes employed in children's advertising in order to establish the possible functions of the message. To contrast these findings, group interviews were conducted with 10 and 11 year-old boys and girls from middle-income families in Santiago, Chile. A comparison of both findings reveals a complex and relational notion of childhood. Children see themselves as burdened by parents, and adulthood as an effective lack of liberty, where the archetypes reveal an image of the adult world as a state of loss with respect to the exercise of creativity, imagination and freedom. These archetypes correlate to children's television output, where a number of shows ridicule the image of adults through irony and parody, presenting them as incompetent in their roles as parents and in their moral authority.","[Vergara, Enrique] Diego Portales Univ, Commun & Arts Fac, Santiago, Chile; [Vergara, Ana] Diego Portales Univ, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Vergara, E (corresponding author), Diego Portales Univ, Commun & Arts Fac, Santiago, Chile.",enrique.vergara@udp.cl; ana.vergara@udp.cl,,"vergara del solar, ana cecilia/0000-0001-7823-3769",,,,32,7,7,0,16,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,MAR 1,2012,19,38,,,,,167,173,,10.3916/C38-2012-03-08,,,7,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,895MX,WOS:000300501400020,,gold,,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

This HLT was designed following the approach of Simon (1995), the design heuristics of emergent models and the mechanism of reflection on activity-effect relationship. We carried out an experiment with university students to determine if this HLT contributed to the expected learning of these concepts. We contrast this HLT with the actual learning trajectory (ALT) of two students showing approximation to key phases of the designed HLT. The results show that the notion of set is useful for the construction of the concept of span. In addition, we found it is necessary to incorporate new questions in HLT that facilitate the reflection on the activity-effect relationship to better account for the learning progression.","[Carcamo, Andrea; Fuentealba, Claudio] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile; [Maria Fortuny, Josep] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Didact Matemat & Ciencies Expt, Bellaterra, Spain",,"Carcamo, A (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Ingn, Valdivia, Chile.",andrea.carcamo@uach.cl; josepmaria.fortuny@uab.cat; cfuentealba@uach.cl,"Aguilera, Claudio Eduardo Fuentealba/H-2416-2016; C‡rcamo, Andrea/AAY-7647-2021","Aguilera, Claudio Eduardo Fuentealba/0000-0001-8071-5150; C‡rcamo, Andrea/0000-0001-5782-3479",,,,33,0,0,2,2,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,"CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA","VICERECTORAT RELACIONS INSTITUCIONALS & CULTURA, UNIV VALENCIA, VICERECTORAT INVESTIGACIO, CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0212-4521,2174-6486,,ENSEN CIENC,Ensen.

International scholarship has emphasized the unequal conditions for minority groups to access higher education, but attention also needs to be given to the ways students forge new identity pathways for themselves within these racialized environments. Our analysis utilizes LatCrit studies to emphasize how marginal and hybrid identities enable forms of resistance and counter-narratives to dominant (white) ideologies and assimilatory practices. We focus on the concept of community cultural wealth and the empowerment that aspirational and resistant capital can give to Indigenous youth, providing alternative motives for their studies in relation to the Indigenous communities to which they belong. The paper contributes to this scholarship by underscoring positive aspects of Indigenous student resistance and agency from an understudied context in Latin America.","[Webb, Andrew] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Av Vikuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Sepulveda, Denisse] Univ Manchester, Sociol Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England",,"Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Campus San Joaquin,Av Vikuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",Andrew.webb@uc.cl,,"Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670; Sepulveda, Denisse/0000-0002-3997-7789",Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [FONDAP 15110006]; Becas Chile [72140258],"This work was supported by Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR) [grant number FONDAP 15110006], and by Becas Chile [grant number 72140258].",,52,0,1,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-5079,1470-174X,,STUD HIGH EDUC,Stud.

His appearance was that of a normal person but variations in light greatly influenced his vision. During his first two years at a university in Australia, Tom had particular difficulty making sense of assessment and feedback. His perceptions, struggles and strategies are presented here as a narrative, primarily in his own words. Tom's interactions with academics were strong contributors to his mostly negative perceptions about assessment and feedback. Key influencers were his cultural background, his approach to feedback, and his own expectations of the role feedback should play. An analysis of four in-depth interviews and a written response of this student's attitudes, needs and issues demonstrate how academics, university stakeholders and experts in assessment and feedback can develop a raised awareness of, and sensitivity to, specialised ways of assisting international students with disabilities. A greater exploration and unpacking of these students' individual needs and difficulties is suggested in the process of understanding feedback and assessment in a new academic context.","[Olave-Encina, Karen] Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Olave-Encina, Karen] Univ Amer, Fac Educ, Vina Del Mar, Chile",,"Olave-Encina, K (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",karen.olave@uqconnect.edu.au,"Olave-Encina, Karen/A-9739-2019","Olave-Encina, Karen/0000-0002-7596-6091",School of Education at The University of Queensland,"Dr Karen Olave-Encina holds a fellowship in the School of Education at The University of Queensland and is also working as a casual lecturer in the School of Languages and Cultures at the same university.

Most of the prior literature on peer effects focuses on the characteristics of peers rather than examining the structure of peer networks. We attempt to measure not only the impact of peers but also the structure of the peer network. In particular we are interested in the characteristics of students' study groups along several dimensions: quality, heterogeneity, size and cohesion. Using pre-college characteristics of students and a random assignment into sections in their first year, we construct instruments of the study group measures to control for endogeneity of the network formation. Our OLS and IV estimates suggest that peer quality improves student performance, and that the breadth and cohesion of students' network positively affects student outcomes. We also find significant heterogeneity of the results depending on network characteristics. Our findings can be used to assist university administrators or professors to choose criteria for sorting students into study groups.","[Berthelon, Matias; Kruger, Diana I.; Montecinos-Pearce, Alejandro] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Ave Padre Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Bettinger, Eric] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 520 Galvez Mall,CERAS 522, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Berthelon, M (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Ave Padre Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",matias.berthelon@uai.cl; ebettinger@stanford.edu; diana.kruger@uai.cl; amontecinos@uai.cl,"Montecinos-Pearce, Alejandro/AAC-2195-2021","Montecinos-Pearce, Alejandro/0000-0001-5484-2690; Berthelon, Matias/0000-0001-7851-2960; Bettinger, Eric P./0000-0002-0337-8223","Learning Center of Teaching Office (Centro Aprendizaje, Direccion de Docencia) at Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Center for Studies of Conflict and Social Cohesion [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]","Matias Berthelon would like to thank the financial support received from the Learning Center of Teaching Office (Centro Aprendizaje, Direccion de Docencia) at Universidad Adolfo Ibanez.

Purpose: This study investigated the perceptions and experiences of some student teachers and their supervisors who used a video application during one practicum period. Student teachers recorded each other's lessons with the video app, and supervisors oversaw student teachers online, via a portal. The study aimed to explore how far the app constituted a useful tool for student teachers' professional development and for the supervision of student teachers' practice. Sample, design and method: The data were collected by gathering the experiences of 12 student teachers and 9 supervisors. Data included focus groups, interviews and video diaries. Analysis was undertaken using principles of content analysis and phenomenographic analysis such as thematising, coding and categorising. Results: Findings suggested that student teachers in general felt that the video app supported their self-reflection. The influence on their professional development may have been limited by factors including lack of guidance for individual and collaborative reflection. Using the video app as a supervisory tool was regarded as challenging in some ways, particularly because video clips taken out of context were unable to capture the classroom's atmosphere, environment and culture. Conclusions: The study highlights that video excerpts in themselves do not provide a sufficient basis for lesson observation. However, the study's results draw attention to the app's potential for guiding individual and collaborative video-based reflection. Consideration should be given to the changes that video-elicited reflection encourages with respect to supervision and its effects on the roles of supervisor and student teacher.","[Korkko, Minna; Kyro-Ammala, Outi] Univ Lapland, Fac Educ, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Morales Rios, Sandra] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Korkko, M (corresponding author), Univ Lapland, Fac Educ, Rovaniemi, Finland.",minna.korkko@ulapland.fi,,"Korkko, Minna/0000-0002-4248-1434",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [2015-1-UK01-KA201-013414],This work was supported by the European Commission under Grant 2015-1-UK01-KA201-013414.,,27,6,6,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1881,1469-5847,,EDUC RES-UK,Educ.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the functioning and effect of the SINs strategy as perceived by principals and curriculum coordinators across the country. Design/methodology/approach An adapted version of the Educational Collaborative Network Questionnaire was applied to a sample of 1,723 participants from 1,375 schools distributed in 398 networks. Descriptive, factor and sub-group statistical analyses by school performance categories and by different roles within these schools and networks are presented. Findings Results indicate that school leaders perceive SINs as an opportunity to work effectively in shared projects that can later be implemented in their own schools. Participants indicate that they can share knowledge in their networks and use it to solve problems in their own schools, which is especially relevant for secondary school leaders who work in difficult circumstances. Results suggest that it is important to facilitate greater autonomy for school leaders in their networks, especially regarding decision making about network goals and activities that are more significant to their contexts. Originality/value This is a national study of a recent school improvement strategy, which provides evidence, from the perspective of school leaders, of its strengths and improvement areas. This study shows that despite being in a competitive context, principals and curriculum coordinators value the opportunities to learn from and with others. These results can be of value for other contexts attempting to promote school networks as a means for school and system improvement.","[Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Lideres Educ, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez Parrao, Constanza] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Leadership Ctr Sch Improvement, Valparaiso, Chile; [Gonzalez, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Lideres Educ, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Pino-Yancovic, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Lideres Educ, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile.",mauricio.pino@pucv.cl; c.gonzalez.14@ucl.ac.uk; luis.ahumada@pucv.cl; alvaro.gonzalez@pucv.cl,"Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/ABA-3272-2021","Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409; Pino-Yancovic, Mauricio/0000-0002-4340-7519",,,,53,3,3,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0957-8234,1758-7395,,J EDUC ADMIN,J.

We identify assets that the students brought to their work-assets that can remain invisible and underused in modal classrooms-as well as the work the teacher did to support these SLPs through cueing, modeling, scaffolding, providing feedback, and defining the practice. We found that as the teacher taught these SLPs, she attended to individual student understandings, grounded the work in the subject-matter domain, and was equitable and ambitious in her instruction.

A total of 123 Chilean secondary students (52 girls and 71 boys; 13.5 +/- 0.7 years old) participated in this study. Physical activity was registered by GT3X accelerometers during an entire week. Results showed that there was a significant increase in the proportion of adolescents achieving the daily recommendation of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on physical education days (23.6%) than on non-physical education days (14.6%) (p <= 0.05). Boys and older adolescents presented statistically higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on physical education days than on non-physical education days. No differences were found in weight status comparison. Physical education has been found to be a crucial element in achieving the daily recommendations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

Since future teachers, in turn, influence the education of the next generation, it is important to understand how service-learning may influence the life purposes of student-teachers themselves, specifically, how emotions influence this development process. Statistical analyses of 198 Madrileno student-teachers' responses to online questionnaires suggested that service-learning involves positive emotions like interest, enthusiasm, inspiration and determination. Surprisingly, these positive emotions decrease during service, except for the 53 student-teachers whose purposes changed. Most reported positive changes in all dimensions of life purpose, with some also noting strengthened relationships between 10 pairs of dimensions, such as between stronger impetus to help others and a clearer understanding of who would benefit.

It also characterizes the aspects in which their views diverge. A mixed methods study was carried out in two stages: first, a quantitative stage, where a self- administered (web-based) questionnaire was sent to the schools; and second, a qualitative stage, where a case study was conducted with three schools. The results show a greater convergence of the teachers' and school principals' views regarding the contribution of ICT resources to teaching, with more divergence when it comes to the implementation process. More specifically, these differences were related to two points: (1) how appropriate the conditions were for using and learning how to use the new resources within the context of the school, and (2) who should be held accountable for integrating ICT resources within the school organization. Furthermore, the qualitative results revealed that school principals only had vague information on the pedagogical integration of the MCLs in their schools. These findings suggest that in order to have more effective technology integration processes in schools, a closer presence of school leaders in the teachers' everyday pedagogical activities is required.","[Claro, Magdalena] Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena; Nussbaum, Miguel] Univ Catolica Chile, CEPPE UC, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Contardo, Victoria] Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",,"Claro, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.; Claro, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Chile, CEPPE UC, Santiago, Chile.",mclarot@uc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; ximclopez@gmail.com; victoria.contardo@gmail.com,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CIE01],This research was made possible thanks to support from Conicyt CIE01.,,27,4,4,3,20,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, LEARNING  TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE",PALMERSTON NORTH,"BAG 11-222, MASSEY UNIVERSITY, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND",1436-4522,,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

We examine the extent to which teacher perceptions of school cohesion and intrinsic motivators stemming from two theoretical traditions contribute to the intent to leave one's school. We find that elementary teachers report higher levels of organizational cohesion within their schools along with stronger intrinsic motivation compared with peers teaching at the high school level, drawing on data from 548 teachers in Los Angeles schools. Teacher perceptions of school cohesion are moderately correlated with intrinsic motivators. However, views of strong leadership and teacher cohesion, not one's own intrinsic motivation, more strongly predict the likelihood of remaining at one's school, based on structural equation estimation with IRT-adjusted measurement models. We discuss implications for shaping interventions to strengthen the social cohesion of schools rather than simply rewarding individual teachers.","[Fuller, Bruce] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Waite, Anisah] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Irribarra, David Torres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, MIDE, Santiago, Chile",,"Fuller, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Spencer Foundation,"We thank Justo Avila and Paul Miller for their steady leadership of this project, along with Cynthia Lim and her research staff, at the Los Angeles Unified School District.

This article describes and analyzes the last twenty years of education policies implemented to support the kinds of schools that welcome underachieving children from vulnerable sectors. The targeted programmes implemented between 1990 and 2007 included the Programme for Improving the Quality of Primary Schools in Poor Areas (P900), the Programme for Improving the Quality of Rural Education (PRural), the Intercultural Bilingual Programme, the Critical Schools Programme and the Priority Schools Programme. Analysis highlights the programmes' limitations (traceable to their failure to consider non-academic factors) and stresses the need to assimilate a pro-fairness education policy that includes positive discrimination. A study and critical analysis of current education policy, the School Grant Preference (SEP) Law, is the focus of the second part of the paper. The conclusion is that there is a need to continue implementing targeted compensatory policies and actions framed within broader strategies that take on the comprehensive formation of individuals in relation to their context, history, community and culture, policies for democratic citizenship, where systems and schools establish the patterns for and promote inclusive, supportive, tolerant, egalitarian socialization, of a sort that can make every child's and every young adult's life aspirations a reality, but which is also relevant for the acquisition of a civic education that is both lever and fulcrum for fair, egalitarian, participatory societies.","[Roman Carrasco, Marcela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, CIDE, Santiago 1825, Chile; [Murillo Torrecilla, F.

The intent is to employ this policy without sacrificing predictive validity of college success. This study explores the theory of action of the high school ranking policy, as well as the high school ranking's ability to predict students' persistence in higher education system and in Chile's higher education institutions using logistic regressions with fixed and random effects (intercepts) and country-wide data. The theory of action shows a main focus on access and a less intense emphasis on the goal of predicting academic success. The access goal is addressed through considerations during the admission process, and there are few efforts geared toward recruitment and graduation. Results also suggest that the high school ranking marginally helps predict college persistence at the institutional level, but only among students attending traditional universities. In light of results, it is recommended that traditional institutions keep working collaboratively to provide new admissions processes that are transparent, equitable, efficient and predict college success.","[Veronica Santelices, Maria; Catalan, Ximena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Horn, Catherine] Univ Houston, Coll Educ, Stephen Power Farish Hall,3657 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Venegas, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Matemat, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",vsanteli@uc.cl,"HORN, CATHERINE L./B-4520-2015; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015; Catalan, Ximena/H-3252-2017","HORN, CATHERINE L./0000-0003-4959-5810; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047; Catalan, Ximena/0000-0003-1408-7621","Chile's Ministry of Education [F811363, FONDECYT 1160871]","This research was funded in part by Chile's Ministry of Education through research Project F811363 and through Project FONDECYT 1160871.

Authentic assessment aims to replicate the tasks and performance standards typically found in the world of work, and has been found to have a positive impact on student learning, autonomy, motivation, self-regulation and metacognition; abilities highly related to employability. Despite these benefits, there are significant barriers to the introduction of authentic assessment, particularly where there is a tradition of testing' decontextualised subject knowledge. One barrier may be the lack of conceptualisation of the term authentic assessment sufficient to inform assessment design at the individual course level. This article tackles that omission by a systematic review of literature from 1988 to 2015. Thirteen consistent characteristics of authentic assessment are identified leading to the classification of three conceptual dimensions: realism, cognitive challenge and evaluative judgement. These dimensions are elaborated and used to propose a step-based model for designing and operating authentic assessment in individual higher education subjects.","[Villarroel, Veronica; Bruna, Daniela] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Ctr Res & Improvement Educ CIME, Concepcion, Chile; [Bloxham, Susan] Univ Cumbria, Fac Educ, City Of Carlisle, England; [Bruna, Carola] Univ Concepcion, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Concepcion, Chile; [Herrera-Seda, Constanza] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Concepcion, Chile",,"Villarroel, V (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psychol, Ctr Res & Improvement Educ CIME, Concepcion, Chile.",vvillarroel@udd.cl,,"villarroel, veronica/0000-0002-3000-2248; Bruna, Carola/0000-0003-0554-7147",,,,89,61,63,7,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0260-2938,1469-297X,,ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU,Assess.

The financial aid policy for students in Chile has undergone major changes over the last decade, which has allowed individuals from usually underrepresented income groups to enroll in higher education institutions. This analysis combines information from four public administrative agencies, obtaining a sample of over 75 % of all high school graduates for the period 2007-2010. Methods include descriptive statistics, logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Both continuous persistence and reentry were studied at the system and at the institutional level for all four cohorts. Descriptive results show that short- and long-term dropout rates at the system level are high, and dropout rates are even higher at the level of institutions. Findings from the PSM show that the non-subsidized state loan is the instrument that displays the strongest correlation with persistence and it holds homogeneously across students from different socioeconomic groups. Among grants, we find consistently positive effects of need-based grants targeting low-income students attending technical institutions. We provide educational policy recommendations based on our findings.","[Veronica Santelices, Maria; Catalan, Ximena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Kruger, Diana] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Valparaiso, Chile; [Horn, Catherine] Univ Houston, Houston, TX USA",,"Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna, Santiago 4860, Chile.",vsanteli@uc.cl,"Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015; HORN, CATHERINE L./B-4520-2015; Catalan, Ximena/H-3252-2017","Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047; HORN, CATHERINE L./0000-0003-4959-5810; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670; Catalan, Ximena/0000-0003-1408-7621",Ministry of Education of Chile through Project FONIDE [F611103]; Anillo Project Statistics for Public Policy in Education from the Chilean Government [SOC 1107],This research was partially funded by the Ministry of Education of Chile through Project FONIDE No: F611103 and by Anillo Project SOC 1107 Statistics for Public Policy in Education from the Chilean Government.,,58,25,27,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Within these rankings, Ibero-American journals have had little-to almost no-presence. This raises awareness on the current state of journal indexes and on what these indexes do and how they have been used in constituting sites of exclusion within the mathematics education community. We contend that ranking systems are perceived as the philosopher's stone of academia, in the sense that they have the ability to convert any material (an article, a journal, the academic production of a scholar) into a precious material within the academic world. This alchemic move not only exacerbates exclusion, but also configures a point system that constitutes places for enjoyment and fetishistic disavowal within researchers. Thus, we want to challenge the assumption that mainstream journal rankings are able to accurately reflect the quality, impact, and reputation of mathematics education journals by taking as empirical data the Ibero-American journals in the field of mathematics education. In problematizing journal ranking effects in the production, dissemination, and socialization of knowledge, we seek to open a discussion regarding the economic-political dynamics that govern publishing practices in mathematics education and that are entangled in the production of knowledge in our discipline.","[Andrade-Molina, Melissa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile; [Montecino, Alex] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Escuela Invest & Postgrad, Gen Jofre 462, Santiago 8330225, Chile; [Sanchez Aguilar, Mario] Inst Politecn Nacl, Programa Matemat Educ, CICATA Legaria, Calzada Legaria 694, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Andrade-Molina, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Matemat, Blanco Viel 596, Valparaiso 2350026, Chile.",melissa.andrade@puev.el; alex.montecino.em@gmail.com; mosanchez@ipn.mx,"Aguilar, Mario S‡nchez/Q-9569-2018","Aguilar, Mario S‡nchez/0000-0002-1391-9388; Andrade-Molina, Melissa/0000-0003-1535-3194; Montecino, Alex/0000-0002-2412-8290",,,,22,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-1954,1573-0816,,EDUC STUD MATH,Educ.

However, international evidence consistently shows that the prevailing modes of classroom talk are monologic. The problem is how to transform science education into dialogic and argumentative spaces. One way to do this is through the use of curriculum materials that support and scaffold dialogic practices. Although there is growing interest in promoting argumentation through curriculum materials, their effect on students' learning and the relationship between curriculum-supported argumentation and learning are still not clear.PurposeThe aim of this study was to contribute to this knowledge gap. We replicated research conducted in the UK as part of the epiSTEMe project, in which curriculum materials supporting dialogic classroom talk were developed and evaluated through a randomised experimental study.SampleA total of 220 students (aged 10-11 years) from 18 classrooms participated in the study, with the classrooms spread across 18 public schools all located in Santiago, Chile.Design and methodWe conducted an experimental study randomised at school level. Eleven teachers delivered science lessons following a teaching programme especially developed to foster dialogic and argumentative classroom talk (the intervention group), and seven teachers delivered lessons in their usual way (the control group). Students were assessed individually using pre- and post-measures of science content knowledge and argumentative skills.ResultsThe results showed that the intervention group obtained significantly higher pre- to post-gains on science content knowledge. Although the control group engaged in significantly more whole-class argumentative dialogue than the intervention group, this did not predict content knowledge learning in the control group. By contrast, in the intervention group the frequency of whole-class argumentative dialogue had a strong and positive effect on the delayed content knowledge post-test, controlling for initial measures.","[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,"; Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231; Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516",Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11100181],This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) project no 11100181.,,57,8,9,3,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0263-5143,1470-1138,,RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC,Res.

Our review organizes and classifies the affordances of these systems, and reveals that comparatively few studies provide evidence about the learning effects of system usage, or perform evaluations in authentic setting conditions.

This paper examines this issue as it is exemplified by the Teachers of Teachers Network (TTN), a program developed by Chile's Ministry of Education. As a program designed to identify and reward high quality teachers, it draws from New Public Management's version of professionalism, which promotes managerial cultures based on individual, test-based incentives. TTN members are granted the opportunity to become entrepreneurs, offering professional development (PD) services to other teachers. As a program designed to develop high quality teachers, it draws from a sociocultural version of teacher professionalism based on the development of interpersonal relations that enhance the collective capacity to solve problems. The results of the current study highlight limitations of implementing teacher quality policies that simultaneously draw from contrasting ideas of professionalism. The five TTN teachers participating in the current study resolved these contradictions by concealing their TTN status and (re)presenting themselves as members of the regular teaching force (peers). Through these discursive moves they subverted the possibility of trust, a key nutrient for collegial learning. These findings are interpreted through Hargreaves' capital theory of school effectiveness and improvement.","[Montecinos, Carmen] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Montecinos, Carmen] Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Santiago, Chile; [Campos-Martinez, Javier] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pino, Mauricio] Univ Illinois, Global Studies Educ Div, Urbana, IL USA; [Dominguez, Rosario] St Margarets British Sch Girls, Lomas De Montemar Concon, Chile",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ave Brasil 2950, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@ucv.cl,"PINO, MAURICIO/V-3439-2018; Campos-Martinez, Javier/AAQ-1351-2020; Carre–o-Dur‡n, Claudia-InŽs/H-6488-2016; , CIAE/R-5423-2017","Campos-Martinez, Javier/0000-0002-2695-8896; Carre–o-Dur‡n, Claudia-InŽs/0000-0001-5021-3344; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848",,,,50,12,14,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

Reasons for this include the mismatch between the methods used to measure the effects and the type of learning promoted, the absence of information regarding the specific types of ICT used, and the scarce attention paid to the monitoring and evaluation of ICT for Education (ICT4E) programs. A monitoring and evaluation scheme would provide qualitative and quantitative data to refine, adjust and improve an ICT4E project, to learn from the experience gained, and to determine whether the program has served its client communities and how it might be replicated. In this paper we present a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) scheme for a specific ICT4E program that supports teaching and learning using mobile computer supported collaborative learning (MCSCL). Using the information provided by the scheme, we analyze the program's impact on student attainment in terms of teacher adoption of innovation. It was found that there were statistically significant positive differences in students whose teachers showed higher adoption levels when compared both to lower adoption cases and other defined control groups. We conclude that an M&E scheme supports the intervention process by providing real-time information for decision making through the application of assessment instruments according to a monitoring plan. This enables intervention activities to be adjusted so as to ensure an adequate level of adoption.","[Rodriguez, Patricio; Nussbaum, Miguel; Sepulveda, Marcos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena] Univ Roma Tre, Rome, Italy",,"Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Coll Engn, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",patricio@ing.puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; marcos@ing.puc.cl; mxlopez@uniroma3.it,"Sepulveda, Marcos/C-4007-2011; Rodr’guez, Patricio/F-8606-2015; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Rodr’guez, Patricio/0000-0002-7361-5132; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",,,,34,17,18,0,19,"NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN",TAIPEI,"129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Findings show that on almost all criterion variables, competent teachers outperformed basic teachers, but differences were usually small.

In analysing factors of influence, many studies have focused on technology-related variables such as computer experience or attitudes toward computers, and others have considered teachers' beliefs as well; most of them have studied undefined categories of teachers and focused on explaining the frequency of technology in classrooms. The present study centres on secondary history teachers' teaching conceptions as a precursor to the ways in which they use computing technology in the classroom. The research is a qualitative study examining the theoretical assumption that teachers' conceptions of teaching and learning guide their pedagogical action. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 Chilean history teachers, and their didactic sequences were filmed extensively. The research found patterns among educational uses of technology in relation to teaching conceptions (defining the latter based on three conceptual groups: direct instruction or individual or social construction of knowledge) in terms of the allotment of time and the manner of teacher technology use, and less sharply defined patterns were also noted in student technology use and teacher-student-technology interactions.","[Arancibia Herrera, Marcelo] Southern Univ Chile, Inst Educ Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Badia Gargante, Antoni] Open Univ Catalonia, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Soto Caro, Carmen Paz] San Sebastian Univ, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Lee Sigerson, Andrew] Southern Univ Chile, Inst Linguist & Literature, Valdivia, Chile",,"Sigerson, AL (corresponding author), Southern Univ Chile, Inst Linguist & Literature, Valdivia, Chile.",andrew.sigerson@uach.cl,"Badia, Antoni/K-2640-2017","Badia, Antoni/0000-0003-1294-8061; Arancibia-Herrera, Marcelo/0000-0002-4314-4253",,,,37,5,6,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1475-939X,1747-5139,,TECHNOL PEDAGOG EDUC,Technol.

The impact of the attitude towards PowerPoint, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, and habit, in the intention to use and actual use of PowerPoint was evaluated. A survey was applied to 106 university professors from two Spanish universities, and the theoretical model was subsequently tested using a path analysis. The results suggest the existence of a direct non-critical path consisting of social pressure and habit, and an indirect critical path consisting of performance expectancy via the attitude towards PowerPoint.

Educators, schools and corporations are increasingly driving these initiatives. This article makes the argument that a narrow vision of digital technology, which both ignores the complexity of education and wastes valuable public resources, is becoming an obstacle to significant improvement and transformation in education. Utilising our research and experience in the field of educational technology, this paper problematises the common elision of 'technology' and 'digital technology'. From this basis, we then critically reflect on various common approaches to introducing digital technology in education under the guise of promoting equality and digital inclusion. These include national government-led programmes, more recent trends for local school-led initiatives, and the role of non-formal education initiatives led by corporations/foundations. Amidst the varying surface-level 'failure' and/or 'success' of these approaches, we point to limited underpinning 'information and knowledge society' logics in framing the application of digital technology to education. As such we conclude by considering the educational challenges for future Ed-Tech initiatives.","[Sancho-Gil, Juana M.; Rivera-Vargas, Pablo; Mino-Puigcercos, Raquel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Educ Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Santiago, Chile",,"Sancho-Gil, JM (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Educ Management, Barcelona, Spain.",jmsancho@ub.edu,"Puigcerc—s, Raquel Mi–o/I-1995-2015; Vargas, Pablo Rivera/AAL-9231-2021; Sancho-Gil, Juana M/L-3047-2014; Pimentel, Priscilla/AAG-6402-2019; Napierala, Joanna/AAU-1256-2020","Vargas, Pablo Rivera/0000-0002-9564-2596; Mino Puigcercos, Raquel/0000-0002-5391-4637; JUANA MARIA, SANCHO-GIL/0000-0002-2941-5619","ESBRINA - Contemporary Subjectivities, Visualities and Educational Environments [2014SGR 0632]; REUNI+D - University Network for Educational Research and Innovation; Social Changes and Challenges to Education the Digital Age (MINECO) [EDU2015-68718-REDT]","ESBRINA - Contemporary Subjectivities, Visualities and Educational Environments (2014SGR 0632) http://esbrina.eu REUNI+D - University Network for Educational Research and Innovation.

UNESCO's SERCE (Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study) database was mined for information about 2,580 principals from 16 Latin-American countries. Data indicate that just 57.7% of school principals in the region are occupied full-time by their school job, and on average they spend 80% of their school time on managerial work and the other 20% on classroom teaching. Of the time allocation directly related to management, principals spend an average of 25% on administrative tasks, 16% on activities related with instructive leadership and 16% on tasks pertaining to supervising and advising the teaching staff (although this varies widely among countries). It was also found that the principal's age, the school's size and the situation of the zone where the school is located are factors that influence time distribution. Lastly, the percentage of time principals spend on educational leadership tasks has a positive influence on the performance of the school's students. School management policies in Latin America should be reformulated to free principals from administrative tasks in order to enable them to devote themselves to activities related with educational leadership.","[Murillo Torrecilla, F.

The aim of this paper is to show how SDG can be used to improve the way resources are used in schools, allowing students to work simultaneously on individual problems at a shared display, and achieve personalized learning with individual feedback within different cultural contexts. We used computational fluency to apply our concept of One Mouse per Child. It consists of a participatory approach that makes use of personal feedback on an interpersonal computer for the whole classroom. This allows for N simultaneous intelligent tutoring systems, where each child advances at his or her own pace, both within a lecture and throughout the curricular units. Each student must solve a series of mathematical exercises, generated according to his or her performance through a set of pedagogical rules incorporated into the system. In this process, the teacher has an active mediating role, intervening when students require attention. Two exploratory studies were performed. The first study was a multicultural experience between two such distanced socio-economic realities as Chile and India. It showed us that even in different environmental conditions, it is possible to implement this technology with minimal equipment (i.e. a computer, a projector, and one mouse per child). The second study was carried out in a third grade class in a low-income school in Santiago de Chile. The students were asked to solve mainly addition exercises. We established statistically relevant results and observed that the software proved most beneficial for the students with the lowest initial results. This happens because the system adapts to the students' needs, reinforcing the content they most need to work on, thus generating a personalized learning process.","[Alcoholado, C.; Nussbaum, M.; Tagle, A.; Gomez, F.; Denardin, F.; Susaeta, H.; Villalta, M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Toyama, K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Nussbaum, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",mn@ing.puc.cl,"Villalta, Marco/B-9555-2012; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Villalta, Marco/0000-0002-7553-925X; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Gomez Zaccarelli, Florencia/0000-0003-0916-0062; Toyama, Kentaro/0000-0002-9128-2255",,,,31,22,22,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

About 980 active academic staff from 43 Spanish public universities participated. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used as a theoretical framework for the operational definition of the variables. Through the use of data mining techniques (clustering and decision trees), groupings were made based on the b-learning adoption stage and a subsequent predictive model of these stages. The results show that the intention to use BL is the most important predictor variable in all models applied. In addition, the relationship between higher frequency of use and experience in digital educational environments with higher stages of implementation of the BL methodology was verified. Regarding the socio-demographic variables included in the study, it was observed that they exert effects that are marginal in all cases. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many universities and higher education institutions are designing strategic plans and diverse actions to implement and spread the use of BL methodologies. TAM has been widely used to study the behaviour and the intention of using a wide variety of specific technologies in the classroom. The study of BL from the perspective of TAM has generally been carried out using inferential analysis techniques. What this paper adds Analysis of complex systems such as the BL methodology from the TAM approach. Groups of adopting teachers can be analysed using the TAM approach according to the stage of use of this innovation. In contrast to traditional inferential techniques, this paper proposes a methodological procedure based on decision trees, which facilitates a more refined analysis of the relationship and interactions between the set of TAM predictor variables (PU, PEOU, BI, etc.) and the criterion variable (stages of adoption). The obtaining of more complete and adjusted trees leads to better prediction and identification of the concrete actions that could be implemented by higher education institutions as protective or motivating factors for the diffusion of the BL methodology. Implications for practice and/or policy Interest in focusing attention on a complex system such as the one represented by the BL methodology from the perspective of models of technological acceptance reinforces an interesting line of research that can enrich the approach and scope of the TAM theory and generates knowledge that helps promote strategic actions to optimise the institutional diffusion of the BL training modality in higher education contexts.","[Victor Martin-Garcia, Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Fac Educ, Salamanca, Spain; [Martinez-Abad, Fernando] Univ Salamanca, Educ Fac, Salamanca, Spain; [Reyes-Gonzalez, David] Metropolitan Univ Educ Sci, Fac Chem, Nunoa, Chile",,"Martin-Garcia, AV (corresponding author), Fac Educ, Paseo Canalejas 169, Salamanca 37008, Spain.",avmg@usal.es,"Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/L-4931-2014; Mart’nez-Abad, Fernando/H-3129-2015; Moreira, Juan Pablo Hern‡ndez/AAL-9552-2021","Martin-Garcia, Antonio Victor/0000-0002-0216-2754; Mart’nez-Abad, Fernando/0000-0002-1783-8198; Moreira, Juan Pablo Hern‡ndez/0000-0001-7110-6054; Reyes-Gonzalez, David/0000-0002-1731-5784",,,,44,7,9,3,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

For this study, qualitative research was undertaken using interviews with 39 secondary school teachers, grouping their interpretations into three types of thinking: positive-mythical, positive-critical and negative-critical. The results show that most teachers expressed some kind of critical interpretation by developing a complex thinking of historical argumentation and analysis. The age variable age did not show remarkable results, but differences were observed with respect to the geographical variable, predominating the critical-negative view in regions where independence movements are developed. However, in relation to the purposes of history teaching, we find an important distance between the ideal discourse and the concrete examples with which they argue their position. That is, many of the teachers with a conception of critical history and connected with the present, found the value of their teaching in an exemplary and closed story of the past, rarely interpretive or critical.","[Martinez-Rodriguez, Rosendo; Sanchez-Agusti, Maria] Univ Valladolid, Segovia, Spain; [Munoz Labrana, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",,"Martinez-Rodriguez, R (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Fac Educ Segovia, Plaza Univ 1, Segovia 40005, Spain.",rosendo.martinez@uva.es,"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/F-2103-2015; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/R-5186-2018","Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/0000-0001-7163-3276; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/0000-0003-3816-0432",,,,48,4,5,3,9,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,1988-592X,,REV EDUC-MADRID,Rev.

It also studies the extent to which teacher observable characteristics, such as teacher training variables, are associated to better performance on either of these measures and whether any of these two assessments is able to effectively measure teacher quality isolated from the effect of the context where teachers work. Context in this article is defined as any variable that is not under the direct control of the teacher but plays an important role on student learning and we believe is captured by school and municipal variables. The study uses hierarchical linear models and information from national and standardized assessments from Chile, specifically from the municipal education sector. Results show a small correlation between the two measures of teacher quality, in the lower end of results from previous studies conducted in the USA, and suggest that there is only a limited relationship between both measures of teacher quality. Teacher initial education type and professional development were statistically associated only to the standard-based measure of teacher quality. Context (both the school and municipal levels) plays an important role in the teacher effect measure, and in the standard-based measures, therefore, we conclude that neither of these measures are context-free. We expect that these results will contribute to the discussion about how to best measure teacher quality and how to evaluate teacher performance both in Chile and other parts of the world.","[Veronica Santelices, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Veronica Santelices, Maria] Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Valencia, Edgar] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, 252 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Matemat, Dept Estadist, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile; [Taut, Sandy] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med MIDE UC, Escuela Psicol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860 Macul, Santiago, Chile",,"Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.; Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",vsanteli@uc.cl; envalenc@gmail.com; jorge.gonzalez@mat.puc.cl; staut@uc.cl,"Valencia, Edgar/A-9678-2019; Gonz‡lez, Jorge/R-7652-2019","Valencia, Edgar/0000-0002-0311-9272; Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795","Chilean government through the Fondecyt [11110262, SOC1107]; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","This research was funded by the Chilean government through the Fondecyt Grant No. 11110262, Grant Anillo SOC1107, and by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile through internal research funding.

SILP includes a network learning setting involving a cluster of three schools supported by university partners that conduct peer reviews and a school learning setting involving school teams in conversations to mobilise new leadership for learning practices. The notions of joint practice development and multivoicedness in professional conversations are the essence of these processes. Data produced through the review process, understood as voices, enabled participants to incorporate the perspectives, conceptual horizon, and intentions of administrators, students, and teachers who need to collaborate for teaching to produce learning. Across schools we observed common learning as well as important differences. These differences show that by taking an active role in making sense of their participation in a professional development programme, learners achieve outcomes that may be much more meaningful than what program designers prescribed. As facilitators we learned with participants about their specific contexts, expanding the affordances they and we envisioned for the use of new tools that became available through their participation in SILP.","[Montecinos, Carmen; Cortez Munoz, Monica; Campos, Fabian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile; [Godfrey, David] UCL, London, England",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl,,"Godfrey, David/0000-0003-3122-240X; MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 0003],This work was supported by CONICYT Grant #FB 0003.

This paper reports the development, implementation, and evaluation of one of the epiSTEMe science modules. Entitled Forces and Proportional Relations, the module covers standard curricular material in the domain of forces, while paying particular attention to the proportional nature of many key constructs. It was developed in collaboration with a small group of teachers; implemented subsequently in 16 classrooms, in all cases involving students from the first year of secondary school; and evaluated through comparison with first-year students in 13 control classrooms who were studying the topic using established methods. Evaluation addressed topic mastery and opinions about the topic and the manner in which it was taught. While further research is required before definite conclusions are warranted, results relating to topic mastery provide grounds for optimism about the epiSTEMe approach.

Programmable robots have become a valuable positive resource in order to succeed in the development of computational thinking, demanding proper training from kindergarten teachers and trainees in order to be able to teach robotic programming. This article has the purpose to 1) identify the frequent errors made by trainee kindergarten teachers when solving a series of robotic problems in a computational thinking module, which develops in the course of Didactics of Mathematics and 2) determine the level of comprehension of the robot concept acquired by the trainees when solving robotics problems. The research developed in a qualitative methodology manner; the data used for this article were collected through the solving of five robotic problems and an open-ended question that had to be answered by each of the 25 participants individually. The results showed that, in general, the most frequent error appeared in problems in which movements were set in a Euclidean space of two dimensions. That is to say, the problems' solving required a selection of different commands: turn, moving forward and/or backwards. Moreover, more than half of the participants who answered the open-ended question succeeded in owning the robot concept once they had solved the problems.","[Jose Seckel, Maria] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Dept Didact, Concepcion, Chile; [Vasquez, Claudia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Math, Villarrica, Chile; [Samuel, Marjorie] Univ Autonoma Chile, Educ Fac, Talca, Chile; [Breda, Adriana] Univ Barcelona, Dept Linguist & Literary Educ, Barcelona, Spain; [Breda, Adriana] Univ Barcelona, Teaching & Learning Expt Sci & Math, Barcelona, Spain",,"Seckel, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Dept Didact, Concepcion, Chile.",mseckel@ucsc.cl,"Breda, Adriana/D-7124-2017; Breda, Adriana/X-5445-2019","Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Breda, Adriana/0000-0002-7764-0511; Vasquez Ortiz, Claudia/0000-0002-5056-5208","Fondecyt research projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11190547]; MCIU/AEI/FEDER, EU [PGC2018-098603-B-I00]","This article was supported by the Fondecyt research project No 11190547 and PGC2018-098603-B-I00 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, EU).",,41,2,2,15,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1360-2357,1573-7608,,EDUC INF TECHNOL,Educ.

This difficulty is linked to the fact that they have not coordinated the processes involved in terms of the quantifier. Specifically, we point to difficulties in building the CBVT as an object and in establishing the determining role of the concept of linear combinations in the CBVT.","[Parraguez, Marcela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Lezama, Javier] Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico; [Jimenez, Raul] Univ Catolica Norte, Antofagasta, Region De Antof, Chile",,"Parraguez, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile.",marcela.parraguez@pucv.cl; jlezamaipn@gmail.com; rjimen@ucn.cl,"Jimenez, Raul/AAA-1491-2021",,,,,24,4,5,0,8,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0212-4521,2174-6486,,ENSEN CIENC,Ensen.

The participants' opinions were collected through two focus groups that were constructed sequentially and inclusively. A key aspect for students, inasmuch as it is a fundamental characteristic of the instructional practices of their educators, involves the coherence between the latter's instructional practices and the educational rationality that they seek to install in prospective teachers' management of didactic-mathematical activities.","[Rojas, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Deulofeu, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",,"Rojas, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",frojass@uc.cl; jordi.deulofeu@uab.cat,,"Rojas, Francisco/0000-0002-0328-8156",,,,24,3,3,0,11,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0212-4521,2174-6486,,ENSEN CIENC,Ensen.

It offers insights into students' voices, while uncovering what they want to learn and the drivers behind this decision. Semi-structured interviews revealed the power of the school socialisation process; for the majority of students, core curriculum subjects are fundamental. The factors that drive their decisions are life in, outside and beyond school, where the family context and socioeconomic inequality are ever-present. This study reinforces our understanding of the importance of listening to student voices when developing school curricula. It also furthers our understanding of what students want to learn in terms of school subjects. These choices have significant implications for relationships of power when defining the curriculum, as well as being framed by a set of rules and an education system that are well-known to the students.","[Araneda, Daniel; Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Bekerman, Zvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Educ, Jerusalem, Israel; [Rojas, Maria] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Sch Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Araneda, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile.",dnaraneda@uc.cl,,"BEKERMAN, ZVI/0000-0002-3493-0770",,,,72,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

This study analyses trends of socioeconomic segregation in Chile (1999-2018), considering a period with an absence of policies aimed at reducing segregation (1999-2007) and a later stage (2008-2015) when measures were implemented with the potential to affect the socioeconomic composition of schools. Results show that the segregation of both disadvantaged and wealthy students increased to extremely high levels during the first period, and has not shown signs of any significant decrease since then. The slight reduction observed in the second period is associated with changes regarding school fees in the private subsidised education sector rather than the selectivity status of the schools.

Multilevel linear regression models are used (individuals and school) along with variables related to academic performance. Results show that parents' educational expectations and perceived self-efficacy have a positive and significant effect on academic performance in Language and Mathematics. Parental involvement practices at home only affect performance in Language, although this finding is not conclusive. Estimates revealed that involvement practices at school are not statistically significant.

A national survey has been done to address this topic, which was answered by the principal and five teachers in 381 urban primary schools. Following Leithwood's school leadership four-category model, 14 practices were considered and measured. Data were analysed by statistical procedures, including the decision tree technique, chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID). Findings showed that in 9 out of 14 practices, FPs have a significantly more favourable evaluation from teachers. Data confirmed that, when compared to other personal traits of principals or school features, gender is the strongest independent variable related with leadership practices. Nonetheless, this advantage occurs in an overall scenario in which both FPs and MPs engage unevenly with the leadership practices across the dimensions of the model. This study does not aim to explain the female advantage, but to show the shape of leadership differences by gender regarding theoretically relevant practices. Nevertheless, its data allow ruling out some possible hypotheses for interpreting those differences. The article suggests that further research is needed to theoretically explain the reasons behind differences in leadership practice by FPs and MPs.","[Weinstein, Jose; Sembler, Matias] Univ Diego Portales, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile; [Weinstein, Marisa] ECLAC Div Gender Affairs, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Valenzuela, Paulina] Datavoz, Providencia, Chile; [Munoz, Gonzalo] Diego Portales Univ, Fac Educ, Providencia, Chile",,"Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Vergara 210, Santiago 8370067, Chile.",jose.weinstein@gmail.com,,"Marfan, Javiera/0000-0002-4627-8820; weinstein, jose/0000-0002-4193-4550; Munoz, Gonzalo/0000-0001-7219-0841",,,,61,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

By private, we mean the decisions and choices regarding educational services of (a) individuals and families and (b) school providers, and how issues that have traditionally been in the public domain (e.g. through government systems, on the agendas of local community/municipal schools) are no longer there (e.g. government systems have been dismantled and replaced with new providers, and local community/municipal schools either no longer exist or provide safety nets for those who fail in the market). What we intend focusing on is depoliticised privatism, where the role of the private in the supply and demand for school places illuminates a shift in the identification and addressing of educational matters from the politicised public to the depoliticised private domain.

Most scholars recommend addressing these problems by awarding individual grades, computing some kind of individual weighting factor (IWF) from peer and (sometimes) self-assessments, which is then multiplied by the group grade to generate an individual grade. Several variants of the IWF method have been proposed, sometimes with complex algorithms. However, theory suggests they are inaccurate and their accuracy has not been evaluated. This article uses Monte Carlo experiments to assess the accuracy of the original IWF method and variants proposed in the past decade. Findings show that the earlier, simpler methods work best and that self-assessments should definitely be avoided.","[Guzman, Sebastian G.] West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, W Chester, PA 19380 USA; [Guzman, Sebastian G.] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Guzman, SG (corresponding author), West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, W Chester, PA 19380 USA.; Guzman, SG (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",sguzman@wcupa.edu,,,Universidad Andres Bello [DI-798-15/JM],This work was supported by Universidad Andres Bello [grant number DI-798-15/JM].,,24,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0260-2938,1469-297X,,ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU,Assess.

The results question previous evidence about a common repertoire of effective leadership practices and suggest that local context will affect the type of leadership that is required for a specific educational system to improve, and therefore the definition of principals' effective practices. For Chile, the article points out that the principals' leadership practices that contribute the most to improve teacher performance are those related to ensuring that teachers' work and professional development are in accordance with the teaching goals of the school, as well as monitoring student work and classroom activities. Nevertheless, Chilean principals are more likely to get involved in the former practices (related to the school teaching goals) than in those related to teachers' work in the classroom, resulting in their actions being more powerful in mobilizing teachers' attitudes and professional practices than their teaching, which reduces their potential to promote teachers' performance. The results have implications for educational leadership research and policy making, especially in non-Anglo-American countries.","[Marfan, Javiera; Pascual, Javier] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Minist Educ Chile, Gen Educ Div, Sch Leadership, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera; Pascual, Javier] Fdn Chile, Ctr Innovat Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Marfan, Javiera] Ctr Res Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Santiago, Chile; [Pascual, Javier] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Pedag Dept, Res Grp Divers & Inclus Complex Soc, Barcelona, Spain; [Pascual, Javier] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",,"Marfan, J (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 1371,Of 500, Santiago 8340523, Chile.",javimarfan@gmail.com,"pascual, javier/M-5964-2019","pascual, javier/0000-0002-1900-7099; Marfan, Javiera/0000-0002-4627-8820; Pascual, Javier/0000-0001-6850-7391",Fund for Research and Development in Education (FONIDE) by the Ministry of Education of Chile [FE11140],"This work was supported by the Fund for Research and Development in Education (FONIDE) No FE11140, provided by the Ministry of Education of Chile.",,40,8,8,2,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

We used a generalization of the traditional regression discontinuity design for the case where treatment assignment is determined by n variables. To gather information on teacher policies and practices, we conducted a survey of 4th-grade teachers in the Greater Santiago area. The results indicate that low-performing schools responded to the treatment by implementing policies that seek to improve their results in the short term.

This study shows that private higher education is facing the following challenges in both nations: (1) an uncritical implementation of neoliberal policies, (2) that there is a very unregulated legislation that has allowed many private institutions to profit within loopholes in the law, (3) that quality has become a central concern and some of the mechanisms applied to correct it have not been effective, showing a lack of a comprehensive system of quality assessment, and (4) that enrolment has grown but with several mismatches that challenge the initial goal of advancing economic development through human resources capacities. Alternative policies are discussed.","[Gregorutti, Gustavo] Univ Montemorelos, Sch Educ, Montemorelos, Mexico; [Espinoza, Oscar] Univ Diego Portales, Comparat Educ Policy Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Oscar; Loyola, Javier] Univ UCINF, Ctr Educ Res, Santiago, Chile; [Eduardo Gonzalez, Luis] CINDA, Policy & Management Res Area, Santiago, Chile",,"Gregorutti, G (corresponding author), Univ Montemorelos, Sch Educ, Montemorelos, Mexico.",grego@um.edu.mx,,"LOYOLA, JAVIER/0000-0001-8336-6873",,,,39,6,6,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,JAN 2,2016,46,1,,,,,136,158,,10.1080/03057925.2014.916605,,,23,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,CY9KP,WOS:000366726100008,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

A survey was administered to a representative sample of 672 parents and guardians of students attending primary schools located in Santiago, Chile. The analyses conducted, based on OLS regression models with municipality-level fixed effects, reveal that parents' educational expectations and perceived self-efficacy behave as relevant predictors of their degree of involvement at home and at school respectively, even attenuating the importance of socioeconomic status (SES). However, results stress the importance of the information provided by the school, especially due to its impact on parents' involvement at home and on their participation in curricular school activities.

This reality highlights the need to have tools that facilitate the design, implementation and evaluation processes for this new educational method. Currently, resources for ensuring the quality of service-learning experiences are scarce and often not validated. This paper describes the procedure followed for the design of the Questionnaire for Self-Assessment of University Service-Learning Experiences and its validation using the modified Delphi method online, which is a qualitative technique that aims to provide a reliable group response. In this study, two rounds of consultation were conducted by email, involving 16 academic experts who assessed the relevance and clarity of the items. While the first round of consultation aimed to analyze the relevance and clarity of all items, in the second round the clarity of the items which had been reformulated was analyzed. Results on the construct and content validity suggested the elimination or reformulation of some of the initial items. The final questionnaire was composed of 41 relevant and clear items, which are estimated through a 5 point Likert scale. Finally, two possible ways of giving continuity to this work are presented: to the opinion of experts who participate in service-learning but are not academic in the validation process; and to undertake a psychometric validation of the questionnaire through intra-test and inter-test methods.","[Lopez-de-Arana Prado, Elena] Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Educ & Deporte, Dept Didact & Org Escolar, Juan Ibanez Sto Domingo 1, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Aramburuzabala Higuera, Pilar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Formac Profesorado & Educ, Dept Didact & Teoria Educ, Francisco Tomas & Valiente 3, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Opazo Carvajal, Hector] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Ctr Estudios Educ & Aprendizaje Basado Comunida, Gen Jofre 462, Santiago, Chile",,"Prado, ELDA (corresponding author), Univ Pais Vasco UPV EHU, Fac Educ & Deporte, Dept Didact & Org Escolar, Juan Ibanez Sto Domingo 1, Vitoria 01006, Spain.",elena.lopezdearana@ehu.eus; pilar.aramburuzabala@uam.es; hopazo@ucsh.cl,,,,,,65,1,1,4,22,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

MOOCs represent an evolution towards the production and offering of structured quality OER. Many institutions that were initially reluctant to providing OER have, however, joined the MOOC wave. Nevertheless, MOOCs detractors strongly criticize their high dropout rates. The dropout rate is a commonly accepted metric of success for traditional education, but it may not be as suitable when dealing with OER, in general, and with MOOCs, in particular, since learners' motivations to take a course are very diverse, and certain selfregulated learning strategies are required to tackle the lack of personalized tutoring and keep pace in the course. This paper presents an empirical study on the motivation and learning strategies of MOOC learners. Six thousand three hundred and thirty-five learners from 160 countries answered a selfreport 7-point Likert-type questionnaire based on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) as part of a MOOC titled Introduction to Programming with Java. Results indicate that learners were highly motivated and confident to do well in the course. Learning strategies, however, can be improved, especially regarding time management.","[Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Estevez-Ayres, Iria; Delgado Kloos, Carlos; Fernandez-Panadero, Carmen] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Alario-Hoyos, C (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",,"Estevez-Ayres, Iria/G-4730-2011; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Fern‡ndez-Panadero, Carmen/N-6346-2016; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Estevez-Ayres, Iria/0000-0002-1047-5398; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Fern‡ndez-Panadero, Carmen/0000-0003-4855-2923; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963","Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, 562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD, 574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network [S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, project RESET [TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [FPDI-2013-17411, PTQ-15-07505]","This work has been co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union, projects MOOC-Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), SHEILA (562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD) and COMPETEN- SEA (574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), by the Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network (S2013/ICE-2715), and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, project RESET (TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R) and fellowships FPDI-2013-17411 and PTQ-15-07505.",,56,53,55,1,36,ATHABASCA UNIV PRESS,ATHABASCA,"1 UNIVERSITY DR, ATHABASCA, AB T9S 3A3, CANADA",1492-3831,,,INT REV RES OPEN DIS,Int.

In this sense, aggregation of the linguistic variables of 10 experts was performed using the probabilistic OR function and they were defuzzyfied using the centroid method to calculate these weights. To measure the quality of the courses, we proceded to find and select relevant MOOC platforms: Udacity, EDX, MiriadaX and Coursera. Subsequently, the most relevant MOOCs related to computers and computer science categories were selected by intentional non-probability sampling. For this data collection method, two engineers accessed these MOOC platforms to code and assessing the quality of these courses using EduTool (R). In general, the analytical and graphic results show that the quality of the average MOOCs analyzed in each platform is located above the score that describes the required minimum (50 %).

Given that dozens of countries across the world are purchasing computers for their students, we ask which elements are necessary to improve learning when introducing digital resources into the classroom. Understood the orchestration as the coordination of conventional and digital resources, we examine whether effective resource orchestration improves student learning. To do so, an 8-month study was undertaken across 17 schools in Uruguay, involving 544 fourth grade students. A treatment group worked under an orchestrated strategy, while a control group followed the national strategy, which includes the One Laptop per Child Computer (XO). Our study confirmed that the national strategy alone is capable of producing significant progress in student learning. However, we also found that the orchestration produces a statistically significant improvement in the results when compared to the control group. The main finding indicates that when teachers have an orchestrated strategy to integrate digital and non-digital resources, student learning is enhanced in relation to the curricular objectives. Finally, we discovered that learning is improved in the treatment group when there is systematic use of resources, and when the school's infrastructure facilitates the use of the technology.","[Diaz, A.; Nussbaum, M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Varela, I.] Univ Catolica Uruguay, Fac Ciencias Humanas, Montevideo, Uruguay",,"Diaz, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Comp Sci, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul, Chile.",akdiaz@puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Varela, Isabel/0000-0002-4007-9388",Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice from Chile [CIE01-CONICYT]; Proyecto Ceibal of the Government of Uruguay; Universidad Catolica de Uruguay,"The research was supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Grant CIE01-CONICYT, from Chile, Proyecto Ceibal of the Government of Uruguay and Universidad Catolica de Uruguay.",,22,4,4,2,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

In particular, it examines the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on track placement (general or vocational), and gaps in higher education access between graduates from both tracks. Result suggests that in a highly socially differentiated education system such as the Chilean one, within-school tracking diminishes SES segregation between tracks. However, the study does not provide evidence that this specific form of tracking mitigates inequalities between tracks, as measured by access to higher education. Considering only the direct effects of tracking operating through instructional and institutional mechanisms, the access gap between general and vocational tracks increases instead of narrowing. The implications for future research are discussed in light of these finding.","[Sevilla, Maria Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Polesel, John] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Vocat & Educ Policy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Sevilla, MP (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Dept Polit & Desarrollo Escolar, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",msevilla@uahurtado.cl,,"Polesel, John/0000-0003-1752-0849; Sevilla, Maria Paola/0000-0001-6418-0272",ANID/FONDECYT Iniciacion [11170547]; Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [ANID/FONDAP/15130009],"We thank the comments of generous reviewers, who provided us with essential insights.

This quantitative case study of Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile sought to understand the longitudinal contributions of combinations of types of financial aid to persistence of low-income students. The results identified that the aggregate availability of both grants and loans at the university-level has a net positive contribution beyond the contributions of national-level grants and loans. In finest distinction, however, only ministry aid (in the form of need-based grants and loans) decreased the likelihood of dropping out. Such findings suggest that universities may want to consider carefully as part of a comprehensive persistence plan how they leverage institution-level contributions to student aid packages.","[Horn, Catherine] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Veronica Santelices, Maria; Catalan Avendano, Ximena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Horn, C (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",clhorn2@uh.edu,"Catal‡n-Avenda–o, Ximena/H-3252-2017; HORN, CATHERINE L./B-4520-2015","Catal‡n-Avenda–o, Ximena/0000-0003-1408-7621; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670; HORN, CATHERINE L./0000-0003-4959-5810",,,,47,7,7,0,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Within this context, the MICREATE project - Migrant Children and Communities in a Transforming Europe (HORIZON 2020-822664) - emerged, whose main objective is to identify and meet the specific needs of children and young migrants related to integration into the host societies via school. The research is being conducted using a mixed methodology with a child-centred approach in order to avoid the assumptions with which adults tend to think about integration. In this way, we seek to create a space that enables them to express their interests and experiences.

Students primarily evidenced correspondence relationship, using natural language and numerical representation to express this functional relationship. Our findings let us to state that (a) although students were not used to working with these types of problems, eleven of them go beyond arithmetic computations, finding relationships that relate the variables; and (b) three students generalized using natural language as a useful vehicle, while there are other students who perceived the same regularity for different specific values but they are unable to represent generalization clearly.","[Pinto, Eder] Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Las Condes 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile; [Canadas, Maria C.; Moreno, Antonio] Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18071, Spain",,"Pinto, E (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Av Plaza 680, Las Condes 7610658, Region Metropol, Chile.",epinto@udd.cl; mconsu@ugr.es; amverdejo@ugr.es,"Moreno, Antonio/AAA-1981-2020; Canadas, Maria C./F-1672-2016","Moreno, Antonio/0000-0002-8284-3903; Canadas, Maria C./0000-0001-5703-2335",Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [EDU2016-75771-P]; Chilean Government through the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [folio 72160307-2015],"This study was conducted under National R&D Project EDU2016-75771-P funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; the first author benefited from a PhD. grant awarded the by Chilean Government through the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT), folio 72160307-2015.",,41,0,0,5,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1571-0068,1573-1774,,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

It draws on Butler, Berlant and Hardt's work on affects, and on feminist contributions to the intersection between school choice, social class and mothering. These contributions help us deepen our understanding of school choice as both a form of passionate attachment to the education market and affective labour. In addition, these perspectives motivate us to go beyond social research sustaining the dominant critical discourse of advantages that middle-classes gain over working-classes through their work in the education market. Our analyses suggest that school choice configures cruel passionate attachments to the education market on middle-class mothers through the construction of working-class others', and models public education as an abject object through the intensification of mothers' affective labour, thus reinforcing their experiences of gendered and affective inequalities.","[Leyton, Daniel] Univ Sussex, CHEER, Brighton BN1 9QQ, E Sussex, England; [Teresa Rojas, Maria] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Leyton, D (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, CHEER, Brighton BN1 9QQ, E Sussex, England.",D.Leyton@sussex.ac.uk,"Leyton, Daniel/ABF-3998-2020","Leyton, Daniel/0000-0003-2472-9835",Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice (CEPPE),"This work was supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice (CEPPE) http://www.ceppeuc.cl/.

The role of emotions in feedback and learning is studied from a socio-cultural perspective. Findings revealed students had a range of complex and dynamic emotional responses to feedback. Three case studies are presented to further explore this complexity. Students' emotions were associated with the self, information on feedback messages, or lack of familiarity with feedback practices.

Given the inherent dialogical nature of formative assessment in the classroom, video can provide a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing teachers' formative assessment interactions with students. In this study, we provide a framework for examining expertise in formative assessment and use this framework to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the practices of 13 mathematics and science teachers. While we only saw a few instances of true expertise in formative assessment practices in our examination of videos, our findings indicate that teachers with more expertise in formative assessment let students' ideas guide their teaching. This leads to higher correlations among the dimensions of practice that we articulate in our framework for expert teachers. However, because many of the instructional decisions that teachers make are not visible on video, video alone may not provide enough information to judge expertise in formative assessment.","[Gotwals, Amelia Wenk; Philhower, Joanne; Bennett, Steven] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48843 USA; [Cisterna, Dante] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Gotwals, AW (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, 620 Farm Lane, E Lansing, MI 48843 USA.",gotwals@msu.edu,"Cisterna, Dante/D-6429-2016","Cisterna, Dante/0000-0002-3304-0813; Gotwals, Amelia/0000-0002-7907-8649",Michigan Department of Education,Work on the Formative Assessment for Michigan Educators (FAME) project was supported by the Michigan Department of Education.,,58,19,19,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1571-0068,1573-1774,,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

The instrument was created to measure the components proposed in the model of Magnusson et al. (1999), except for the orientations. The creation of the questionnaire was carried out through eleven steps: (1) conceptualization, (2-4) creation of items and rubric reviewed by experts (focus on content and construct validity), (5-7) piloting a 32-item questionnaire to 10 biology teachers (focus on face and construct validity and reliability), (8-10) piloting a 16-item questionnaire to 61 biology teachers (focus on discriminant and construct validity and reliability), (11) application of a different instrument (CoRe interview) to four teachers (focus on criterion validity). The final version of the questionnaire (which includes three PCK components) showed in a Rasch analysis for the reliability of the items (alpha = 0.90) and persons (alpha = 0.81) adequate values. When applying the final version of the questionnaire, there is also evidence of discriminant validity (differences between two groups of teachers with or without professional development in evolution education).

The quality and long-term commitment of teachers represent related mediators that may help to explain effective and ineffective charter schools. Early findings on the comparative rates of annual turnover-exiting from one's school-appear to show higher turnover in charter schools relative to TPSs. But longitudinal data that allow scholars to track teachers over time remain rare. Little evidence exists on how organizational context may interact with individual teacher characteristics to further explain the propensity to leave one's school. Purpose/Objective: Prior research on teacher turnover focused mostly on whether or not and who leaves. Our research builds on and extends prior studies by investigating not only whether and who but also when a teacher leaves. The phenomenon of our study emphasizes the dynamic nature of teacher exit; namely, we are interested in examining when teachers are at the greatest risk of exiting schools. This dynamic focus marks a departure from the typical teacher turnover analysis in which exit is conceptualized as a status (i.e., exit or not). Population/Participants/Subjects: We used a large sample of elementary (4,788) and secondary teachers (8,467) panel data (from 2002-03 to 2008-09) from the LAUSD. A little over 80% of the teachers in the elementary sample were female, while 61% of the secondary teachers were female. About 40% of the elementary and 47% of the secondary teachers were white. The average years of teaching experience was about two for both elementary and secondary teachers. Special education teachers accounted for 12% of the elementary and 15% of the secondary study sample, respectively. Research Design: We combined event history and multilevel modeling analysis in order to investigate when a teacher exits his or her first assigned school and how organizational membership conditions decision processes at the individual level. Conclusions/Recommendations: The longitudinal and multilevel analysis of teacher turnover supports our theoretical position that organizational dynamics and contextual factors are likely to condition the decision process made at the individual level and thereby influence individual behaviors (i.e., decision to leave a school at certain point in time). This cross-level theoretical perspective adds further support to the argument that focusing on recruiting capable teachers and paying attention to working conditions for long-term staffing stability are aspects of schooling that matter most for student learning, as opposed to a horse-race game (i.e., choice and competition).","[Newton, Xiaoxia] Univ Massachusetts, Res Methods & Evaluat Educ, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Rivero, Rosario] Univ Diego Portales, Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Fuller, Bruce] Univ Calif Berkeley, Educ & Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dauter, Luke] GreatSchools, Data Sci, Oakland, CA USA",,"Newton, XX (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Res Methods & Evaluat Educ, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",,,,,,,74,1,1,1,11,TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV,NEW YORK,"525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

We compared group and individual feedback, using two technologies: (1) Technology-mediated, Peer-Assisted Learning (TechPALS), which uses wireless handheld technology to structure feedback in small groups as they solve fractions problems and (2) a popular desktop product, which provides feedback to individual students as they solve fractions problems individually. Three elementary schools participated in a randomized controlled experiment conducted in the 2007-2008 school year. Students in the TechPALS condition learned more than did the control group students, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.14 to d = 0.44. Analysis of observational data confirmed that students in the TechPALS condition participated socially in questioning, explaining, and discussing disagreements, whereas students in the individual condition did not. We conclude that an integration of technology, cooperative activity designs and broader educational practices can lead to impact on students' mathematics learning.","[Roschelle, Jeremy; Rafanan, Ken; Bhanot, Ruchi; Estrella, Gucci; Penuel, Bill] SRI Int, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Claro, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Roschelle, J (corresponding author), SRI Int, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",jeremy.roschelle@sri.com,"Roschelle, Jeremy/AAJ-6292-2020; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Roschelle, Jeremy/0000-0003-2219-0506; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Claro, Susana/0000-0001-5168-4164",,,,59,52,53,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1042-1629,,,ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES,ETR&D-Educ.

One of the proposals has been to reuse Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) as Small Online Private Courses (SPOCs), or as complementary resources in traditional courses through blended learning practices, such as flipped classroom. However, the integration of online courses as a complement to face-to-face courses poses some challenges. First, students are not used to such blended learning approaches and it is generally difficult for teachers to motivate them to access online resources for the preparation of face-to-face sessions. Second, students are not used to the dynamics of blended learning scenarios, which are less teacher-centered and require their active participation. We propose the use of the mobile application MyMOOCSpace (MMS) to meet these challenges and increase students' motivation and use of learning resources in blended learning courses that use SPOCs as a complement. MMS is a mobile learning application based on gamification mechanisms to promote collaboration and motivation of students in the use of digital resources as a complement to blended learning courses. In this paper, we present the results of a quasi-experiment in a blended course with 294 students that uses a SPOC as a complement, with the aim to assess the effect of MMS on students' motivation and learning resources consumption. In particular, the behavior of two groups of students with the main digital resources of the SPOC (videos and formative assessments) was analyzed: one using the MMS (GTest group), and the other not using MMS (GTrad group). The results suggest that the use of MMS had a positive correlation with the videos consumption, besides increasing student' interaction with assessment exercises in the SPOC.","[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres; Hilliger, Isabel; Rojos, Felipe] Pontificia Catolica Univ Chile, Ciencias Computac, Macul, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Ingn Telemat, Madrid, Spain",,"Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Catolica Univ Chile, Ciencias Computac, Macul, Chile.",llramirez@uc.cl,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/K-3451-2014; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963","PROF-XXI [609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; InnovaT [598758-EPP-1-2018-1-AT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161264]; eMadrid Network [P2018/TCS-4307]; FEDEREuropean Commission [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; LALA Project [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins, Santiago's grant [1000/532/14]; Corfo 2030 Project [14ENI2-26862]","This work was supported by PROF-XXI: [Grant Number 609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; InnovaT: [Grant Number 598758-EPP-1-2018-1-AT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Conicyt: [Grant Number 21161264]; eMadrid Network: [Grant Number P2018/TCS-4307]; FEDER -Project Smartlet: [Grant Number TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; LALA Project: [Grant Number 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins, Santiago's grant: [Grant Number UBO ` H Rect.

Problems reported by novice public school principals (n = 94) were compared to those reported by their more experienced peers (n = 120). Data were gathered through an online survey and eight in-depth interviews. Findings showed that groups did not differ in the overall pattern of responses when problems were categorized at the system level (45%), interactions with people (33%), at the school and territory levels (15%), and within themselves (7%). Differences were observed when comparing the extent to which each group reported problems managing up (interactions with the municipal department of education and Ministry of Education) and managing down (initiating changes in the school's culture and structures). The high frequency and types of problems reported at the system level indicate the need to align policy reforms addressing leadership practices at intermediate and school levels. The findings also suggest guidelines for the professional development programs that extend beyond normative practices for effective school leadership, by also responding to country specific social and organizational structures.","[Montecinos, Carmen; Aravena, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bush, Tony] Univ Nottingham, Sch Educ, Nottingham, England",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Ctr Liderazgo Mejora Escolar, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@pucv.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017","MONTECINOS, CARMEN/0000-0001-8382-1848",CONICYT-FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140906]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [FB 003],We are grateful for the funding provided by CONICYT-FONDECYT Grant # 1140906 and CONICYT FB 003,,72,14,16,6,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0738-0593,1873-4871,,INT J EDUC DEV,Int.

Applying rapid mapping techniques used for scoping studies, we review 359 research and policy documents and give coherent, meaningful shape' to what we know and what we don't know about school leadership in the region. Attention in research and policy to school leadership in Latin America was relatively slow to arrive: whilst it grew steadily in the first decade of this century it remains low compared to other regions of the world. We provide an overview of the school leadership policy environment in several countries, describing recruitment, selection, evaluation, and job responsibilities of principals; relevant leadership frameworks; and requirements for training or professional development. We speculate on what might explain the diverse ways that school leadership has been taken up in the region: degree of school system centralization; policy borrowing; stage of development; technocratic problem solving; and neoliberal accountability.","[Flessa, Joseph; Bramwell, Daniela; Fernandez, Magdalena] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Educ Leadership & Policy, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada; [Weinstein, Jose] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Weinstein, Jose] Ctr Dev Educ Leadership, Santiago, Chile",,"Flessa, J (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Educ Leadership & Policy, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.",joseph.flessa@utoronto.ca,,,,,,112,23,26,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

We classified the results based on the type of numerical problem posed, the level of curricular content involved and the cognitive domain assessed by each question. We found that Spanish future primary teachers had sufficient knowledge of the primary and lower secondary content questions with the exception of working with the concepts of reason / proportion / percentage and the translation of a simple subtraction of fractions into a word problem. Even though they reported knowing about the density of irrational numbers, Spanish future teachers showed insufficient knowledge of advanced mathematics content.

Differences have been demonstrated between students who receive education in this area from an early age and those who do not. However, not enough work has been done to measure these skills in a classroom setting. Given that the best time to teach critical thinking is during the first years of primary education, we designed a test to determine the level of critical thinking among 3rd and 4th grade students in Language Arts using a graphic novel. We showed the legitimacy of the instrument through Construct Validity, Content Validity, Pearson product-moment correlation, Reliability and Item Analysis. Using the instrument, we studied how critical thinking skills differ among 3rd grade students, according to their socioeconomic status (SES), studying schools with low, middle and high SES. We found significant differences between the schools, which suggest that there may be a relationship between socioeconomic status and the development of critical thinking skills. The test presented in this study is an improvement on existing assessment tools as it replaces unidimensional models with models that provide a more detailed and multidimensional picture of student learning.

Although there has been extensive relevant research, it is not clear enough how oral argumentation spontaneously occurs in science teaching. This is particularly important with regard to the empirical evidence suggesting the effect of discussion of contradictory views on scientific learning. In order to contribute to the research on argumentation in science teaching, we conducted a study that aims to sketch a panoramic view of the uses of oral argumentation in Chilean middle-school science teaching. A total of 153 videotaped science lessons were observed, involving students aged 10-11 and 12-13. Whole-class argumentative discourse was analysed as a function of thematic episodes and teachers' and students' utterances. Results suggest that argumentative discourse in which contradictory points of view are discussed is scarce but when it occurs it does so predominantly within discourse among students. On the contrary, argumentation aimed at justifying points of view is widely used, even more so when students are older.","[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Santiago 8340575, Chile; [Howe, Christine] Univ Cambridge, Fac Educ, Cambridge, England",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psicol, Almirante Barroso 26, Santiago 8340575, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,"Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231",,,,54,17,24,4,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

The epistemology of the teacher influences his teaching and affects the school model as a tool for change or social continuity.

In such scenarios, telecollaboration and virtual exchange have gained increased attention as powerful pedagogical strategies to allow for the continuity of intercultural exchanges and understanding the trends of this growing field can be of high significance to practitioners when planning future related initiatives. Although telecollaboration and virtual exchange are not new phenomena, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough bibliometric study of the area, considering the characteristics of its publications and its scientific community, has not yet been developed. This study carried out a bibliometric analysis of the telecollaboration and virtual exchange research field using a set of 254 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases with the objective of characterising the area as well as identifying research tendencies. In particular, this study uses four analytical scientometric tools: co-citation, co-authorship, keywords co-occurrence analysis and identification of research trends. This study identified emerging and declining themes in the field of telecollaboration and virtual exchange, confirming that the practice is increasingly adopting diverse formats and cutting across different knowledge fields. In addition, results showed that international collaboration so far involves few countries and there is much space to widen co-authorship networks to enhance intercultural exchanges. The review also explores the benefits and drawbacks of the technological tools adopted in the studies from our sample database.","[Barbosa, Marcelo Werneck] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Ave Pedro de Valdivia 425, Santiago, Chile; [Ferreira-Lopes, Luana] Univ Deusto, Deusto Business Sch, Bilbao, Spain",,"Barbosa, MW (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Ave Pedro de Valdivia 425, Santiago, Chile.",marcelo.werneck@uautonoma.cl,"Werneck, Marcelo/AAJ-5702-2020","Werneck, Marcelo/0000-0003-3993-5375; Ferreira Lopes Silva, Luana/0000-0001-6999-0231",,,,107,1,1,13,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1911,1465-3397,,EDUC REV,Educ.

Five postgraduate students and five teacher educators from three different Masters of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (MTEFL) programs agreed to take part in the research. Informed by a qualitative paradigm, semi-structured interviews were conducted aimed mainly at (1) unpacking teacher educators' and postgraduate students' understandings of CT; (2) investigating postgraduates' views of the place of critical thinking in their English teacher education training; (3) examining the ways in which teacher educators deal with CT in their pedagogies; and (4) identifying students' preparedness to approach reading and writing critically, as viewed by both groups of participants. Analysis of responses revealed, on the one hand, students' recognition of CT skills as necessary to succeed in academic life and, on the other, great concerns for the limited importance accorded to teaching these skills in teacher education courses. Teacher educators' responses generally showed an increasing interest in trying to incorporate the teaching of CT skills in their pedagogies, but admitted to an overall lack of consistency in the implementation process. The paper concludes with critical questions about the perceived pedagogical mismatches between teacher educators' and postgraduate students' perceptions of the role of CT in their academic journeys, and about the role of Chilean teacher education programs in addressing these issues.","[Veliz, Leonardo] Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Veliz-Campos, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile",,"Veliz, L (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Fac Arts & Educ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",leonardo.v@deakin.edu.au,"Veliz, Leonardo/ABH-9324-2020",,,,,52,3,4,5,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-2517,1470-1294,,TEACH HIGH EDUC,Teach.

Their identities, however, are not entirely of their own making. Through a qualitative study, and deploying a social realist perspective, this paper analyses academic identities in Chile and attempts to locate the patterns of identity in the context of a marketised higher education system. The data were collected in both a state and a private university. The results suggest that distinct kinds of fragilities may be emerging among Chilean academics (ontological and contractual fragilities). These two fragilities can be traced to the attendant structures of the university system at an institutional level (reputational fragility in the public sector and a branding fragility in the private sector). The paper concludes by observing that, although the power of the structures is considerable, there are still spaces for agentic responses.","[Guzman-Valenzuela, Carolina] Univ Valparaiso Chile, Valparaiso, Chile; [Barnett, Ronald] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England",,"Guzman-Valenzuela, C (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso Chile, Sch Psychol, Fac Med, Ave Brasil 2140, Valparaiso, Chile.",carolina.guzman@uv.cl,"Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/ABE-9956-2020","Guzm‡n-Valenzuela, Carolina/0000-0002-7974-762X",,,,40,20,22,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-1005,1467-8527,,BRIT J EDUC STUD,Br.

However, the concept has not yet been sufficiently researched in tertiary educational settings, and in this case, specifically in Chilean higher education. This paper explores whether toxic leadership was present in country's universities and, if so, to assess its impact over academics' work engagement. A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted, using a sample of 592 academics from two different Chilean universities, who voluntarily responded to two validated scales: One to measure toxic leadership perceptions (Schmidt's toxic leadership scale) and other one to measure work engagement (UWES(R) work engagement scale). The results corroborated the presence of toxic leadership in the consulted institutions, but a significant relationship between this style of leadership and work engagement was not established. This finding suggests that, even though the participants recognise the presence of toxic leadership, work engagement was not necessarily affected by their leader's behaviour.","[Klahn Acuna, Blanca] Univ Concepcion, Periodont & Implantol, Concepcion, Chile; [Male, Trevor] UCL Inst Educ, Ctr Educ Leadership, London, England",,"Acuna, BK (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dent Fac, Concepcion 8370146, Chile.; Acuna, BK (corresponding author), UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",blancaklahn@gmail.com,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

The methodology was qualitative and made use of semi-structured interviews. The study analysed dialogues from 70 teachers, 35 in each country. The initial results indicate a predominance of moral and participatory conceptions of citizenship, to the detriment of legal or identity-based conceptions. The controversial political, social and economic context of both countries within which the interviews were conducted is a key factor to understanding the teachers' perspectives on their conceptions and the meaning of these.","[Martinez-Rodriguez, Rosendo; Sanchez-Agusti, Maria] Valladolid Univ, Valladolid, Spain; [Munoz-Labrana, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",,"Martinez-Rodriguez, R (corresponding author), Valladolid Univ, Valladolid, Spain.",rosendo.martinez@uva.es; almagosa@sdcs.uva.es; carlosem@udec.cl,"Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/F-2103-2015; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/R-5186-2018","Sanchez-Agusti, Maria/0000-0001-7163-3276; Munoz, Carlos/0000-0003-2044-1965; Martinez Rodriguez, Rosendo/0000-0003-3816-0432",,,,58,1,1,0,3,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",1682-3206,1947-9417,,EDUC CHANGE,Educ.

This is particularly evident through multimodal composition and collaboration in primary classrooms. Over two decades ago, the New London Group argued that all meaning-making is multimodal. By representing their knowledge through multiple modes and for local and global audiences, students can express their identity, exercise agency, and foster a sense of authoring through multimodal production.","[Thibaut, Patricia] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Social Sci, Valdivia, Chile; [Curwood, Jen Scott] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Educ & Social Work, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Thibaut, P (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Hist & Social Sci, Valdivia, Chile.",patricia.thibaut@uach.cl,,"Thibaut, Patricia/0000-0003-2990-0339",Becas Chile scholarship programme - Chilean government,This study was supported by the Becas Chile scholarship programme sponsored by the Chilean government.,,24,14,14,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0040-5841,1543-0421,,THEOR PRACT,Theory Pract.,,2018,57,1,,,,,48,55,,10.1080/00405841.2017.1392202,,,8,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,FU2LP,WOS:000423682000007,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,theory into practice,Q2

To reach these objectives, we selected a sample of 20 teachers (10 men and 10 women) from the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, considered competent and experienced teachers, and they answered an in-depth interview to give us an account of their declared teacher identity. After a content analysis of the interviews, the study concludes by showing that: a) in general terms, the competence profile model is confirmed, but the deeper sense and significance that these competences have to participants is conflictive. We identified five thematic spaces that posed discrepancies and conflicts with the theoretical model; b) the participants have clear regularities in the way of conceiving and coping with teaching in university classrooms. We think that the results provide valuable guidance for the design of training programs and evaluation systems for university teachers.","[Monereo, Caries] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Psicol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Dominguez, Carola] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Unidad Desarrollo Profes Docente, Santiago, Chile",,"Monereo, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Campus Bellaterra, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",carles.monereo@uab.cat; dominguez.carola@gmail.com,"Font, Carles Monereo/ABF-5247-2020; Monereo, Carles/AAN-9824-2021; Monereo, Carles/J-9844-2017","Monereo, Carles/0000-0001-7447-985X;",,,,13,7,7,3,25,UNIV NACIONAL EDUCACION DISTANCIA,MADRID,"PO SENDA REY,BRAVO MURILLO 38, MADRID, 7-28040, SPAIN",1139-613X,2174-5374,,EDUC XX1,Educ.

Results show that the availability of basic infrastructure and services (water, electricity, sewage), didactic facilities (sport installations, labs, libraries), as well as the number of books in the library and computers in the school do have an effect on the achievement of primary education students in Latin America, but their relative weight varies significantly from country to country.

The students declare to make a didactic use of the networks and their tools and, at the same time, they recognize the collaborative work as a methodology that promotes their learning and that is fostered by the use of the DSN. Among the purposes of the following study, we find the question of the perceptions that students have regarding the use of social networks as an educational tool and to know their preferences regarding collaborative work. The research carried out falls within the so-called ex post facto, not experimental and descriptive. The sample of the research was formed by 460 students who studied different degrees in the engineering area of a Chilean higher education institution, during the 2017-18 academic year. Among the remarkable results, we can affirm that the Internet is presenting itself as one of the technologies that is penetrating more strongly in the Universities, and that the students use it constantly for educational purposes. It is for these reasons that we consider that there are initial conditions for the incorporation of social networks to formal education. In addition, our results show that the interest to work with other students determines the attitude of students towards collaborative work. This leads us to claim the need for the teacher to ensure the perceptions that students have, and apply specific strategies.","[Cabero-Almenara, Julio] Univ Seville, C Jimenez Aranda 19,7,4A, Seville 41018, Spain; [Del Prete, Annachiara; Arancibia Munoz, Maria Luisa] Univ Tecnol Chile, INACAP Casa Cent, Ave Condor 720, Santiago, Chile",,"Cabero-Almenara, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, C Jimenez Aranda 19,7,4A, Seville 41018, Spain.",cabero@us.es; aadelprete@inacap.cl; marancibiam@inacap.cl,"Del Prete, Annachiara/AAK-9213-2020; Almenara, Julio Cabero/R-7153-2017","Del Prete, Annachiara/0000-0002-3003-2885;",,,,30,7,9,1,3,ASOC IBEROAMERICANA EDUCACION SUPERIOR DISTANCIA,MADRID,"UNED, FAC EDUC, C/ JUAN DEL ROSAI, 14, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",1138-2783,1390-3306,,RIED-REV IBEROAM EDU,RIED-Rev.

Of all the participants in an MOOC, top contributors are the ones who more actively contribute via social tools. This article analyses and reports empirical data from five different social tools pertaining to an actual MOOC to characterize top contributors and provide some insights aimed at facilitating their early detection. The results of this analysis show that top contributors have better final scores than the rest. In addition, there is a moderate positive correlation between participants' overall performance (measured in terms of final scores) and the number of posts submitted to the five social tools. This article also studies the effect of participants' gender and scores as factors that can be used for the early detection of top contributors. The analysis shows that gender is not a good predictor and that taking the scores of the first assessment activities of each type (test and peer assessment in the case study) results in a prediction that is not substantially improved by adding subsequent activities. Finally, better predictions based on scores are obtained for aggregate contributions in the five social tools than for individual contributions in each social tool.","[Alario-Hoyos, C.; Munoz-Merino, P.

Results show that students' attitudes towards university and perceptions about social capital are the most important predictors of their intentions to progress to university. In addition, students' knowledge about university was found to be a significant contributor to students' attitudes and perceptions of control.","[Carrillo-Higueras, Franz] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Valdivia, Chile; [Walton, T.

Corequisite math courses provide opportunities for underprepared students to develop their basic math skills through simultaneous enrollment in college-level and developmental courses. However, adding the additional developmental course also increases students' academic workload, potentially impeding their progress early in their college journey. Our study explores the effects of being assigned to this additional developmental math class at one of the largest technical colleges in Chile. Few remedial studies have examined the effects of corequisite courses in the technical college context, either in the United States or abroad. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that for students attending a technical college and scoring close to the cutoff on a standardized mathematics placement exam, being assigned to a corequisite math course increases the grades in their college-level math course and marginally decreases their likelihood of withdrawing during the first semester, compared to students assigned to a single college-level math course. The effects on credits earned and first semester grades are driven by those pursuing less advanced technical degrees.","[Boatman, Angela] Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Claro, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Gobierno, Santiago, Metropolitan Re, Chile; [Fresard, Matias] Duoc UC, Santiago, Metropolitan Re, Chile; [Kramer, Jenna W.] RAND Corp, Arlington, VA USA",,"Boatman, A (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Lynch Sch Educ & Human Dev, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",angela.boatman@bc.edu; sclaro@gmail.com; mfresard@fen.uchile.cl; jkramer@rand.org,,"Claro, Susana/0000-0001-5168-4164",,,,58,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0361-0365,1573-188X,,RES HIGH EDUC,Res.

Purpose: This study explores the conceptualisation and practice of the use of Big Ideas of science education by primary and secondary teachers in Chile. Sample: A total of 63 science teachers (a purposive sample) from pre-school, primary and secondary education in Valparaiso Region in Chile participated in the study, with 38 of them answering all the questions in the research instrument and 25 answering some of them. Design and methods: The research instrument was a questionnaire with open-ended questions. Results: The use of Big Ideas was seen as the 'natural way' to teach science, mostly related to the students' daily lives. Many of the teachers had their own understanding of Big Ideas. They were very positive about Big Ideas, seeing them as a possible way of connecting with the daily lives of students and facilitating progression in students' learning of science. The teachers also saw Big Ideas as enabling students to work collaboratively and make links between different parts of the curriculum, helping them to understand how science works, and preferable to having to teach an overloaded science curriculum that lacks such an organising framework. Conclusion: The teachers were more interested in their own creation and development of Big Ideas rather than simply adopting the existing, official published framework and adhering to what is said in the Chilean curriculum regarding the approach of Big Ideas. These results indicate the need to explore in-depth such varied conceptualisations of schoolteachers regarding the approach of Big Ideas. In turn, this can offer empirical insights into the way Big Ideas are treated in policy documents in Chile and elsewhere.","[Bravo Gonzalez, Paulina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, CIDSTEM, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bravo Gonzalez, Paulina; Reiss, Michael J.] UCL, UCL Inst Educ, London, England",,"Gonzalez, PB (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Educ, London, England.",paulina.bravo.g@pucv.cl,"Reiss, Michael/P-8205-2017","Reiss, Michael/0000-0003-1207-4229; Bravo Gonzalez, Paulina/0000-0002-7765-3160",,,,47,0,0,34,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0263-5143,1470-1138,,RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC,Res.

We maintain that globalisation operates as a way to reason about space that produces images and narratives of universities, knowledge and students. We focus our analysis on curriculum reform as a way universities materialise the seemingly abstract economic logic of the so-called 'knowledge society' at the level of student-citizens, who are to be educated to become economic globalisation's next agents. In order to locate curriculum's productive role within university respatialisation, we offer a discourse analysis of the circulation of ideas about globalisation and higher education through intergovernmental and national documents, which take material form in a US state university system's attempted curricular reform of its general education core. We inquire into the ways space, as a rationality, acts to create systems of reasoning about institutions, knowledges and subjects that furthers the production of a neoliberal global imaginary.","[Matus, Claudia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Talburt, Susan] Georgia State Univ, Inst Womens Gender & Sexual Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",,"Matus, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",cmatusc@uc.cl,"Matus, Claudia/A-6840-2017","Matus, Claudia/0000-0002-9180-8237",,,,48,13,13,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,MAR 4,2015,45,2,,,,,226,247,,10.1080/03057925.2013.842682,,,22,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,CA2XM,WOS:000348769200001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

Recently, the Chilean Congress passed Law # 20.027 of 2005, which provides the legal framework for the creation of a student loan system guaranteed both by the State and by higher education institutions (HEIs), financed by the private capital market through the securitization of the loans. The system operated for the first time in 2006, where approximately 21,000 students were able to access financing of their higher education for the remainder of their careers. It is expected that as the system matures, more and better information will be available, which will benefit the students and the HEIs; and it is highly likely that the current number of financed students could grow significantly in the next few years.

A qualitative design with communicative methodology was used. Data collection instruments were interviews, observations and focus groups. For data analysis, content analysis was employed. In this article, we will show the analysis of the actions arising from the deductive dialogue category oriented towards the inductive (emerging) egalitarian dialogue category. We conclude that dialogue actions such as listen closely, give equal participation opportunities, and accept arguments which contribute helped establish egalitarian dialogue in the classroom between the teacher and the collaborators with the children. This implied that, progressively, horizontal relations were established in the classroom, where the opinions and contributions of children were accepted based on arguments, since egalitarian dialogue is not directed by power relations.","[Nunez Solis, Marcela] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Nunez Solis, Marcela] Univ Concepcion, Dept Didact Curriculum & Evaluat, Concepcion, Chile; [Murillo Estepa, Paulino] Univ Seville, Dept Didact & Educ Org, Seville, Spain; [Nunez Solis, Marcela] Juan Antonio Coloma 0201, Los Angeles 4440000, Chile; [Murillo Estepa, Paulino] Calle Pirotecnia Sin, Seville 41013, Spain",,"Solis, MN (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Didact Curriculum & Evaluat, Concepcion, Chile.",marcenun@udec.cl; paulino@us.es,,,,,,30,1,1,7,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2210-6561,2210-657X,,LEARN CULT SOC INTER,Learn.

Content analysis of focus group interview transcripts evidenced three school-level patterns of participation, associated with distinct goal orientations. Projective participation to judge the quality of the school's practices was associated with a learning orientation (one school). Consultant participation to demonstrate competence to external inspectors was associated with a performance-approach orientation (one school). Simple participation to complete tasks imposed by administrators was associated with a performance-avoidance orientation (four schools). School-level differences highlighted teachers' perceptions of the characteristics of their school's culture associated with the adoption of these goal orientations. These included existing internal accountability practices, the social capital the school could leverage to implement self-assessment and use external feedback, and the existing structures for teacher participation in decision making. These factors may prove to be a useful guide for the development of induction strategies to support the use of school assessment in ways that foster, rather than diminish, teachers' motivation.","[Montecinos, Carmen; Ahumada, Luis] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Coll Philosophy & Educ, Valparaiso, Chile; [Madrid, Romina] Univ Minnesota, Dept Org Leadership Policy & Dev, Coll Educ & Human Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Fernandez, Maria Beatriz] Boston Coll, Dept Teacher Educ Special Educ Curriculum & Instr, Lynch Sch Educ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",,"Montecinos, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Sch Psychol, Coll Philosophy & Educ, Ave Brasil 2950,Casilla 4059, Valparaiso, Chile.",carmen.montecinos@ucv.cl; rominamadrid@gmail.com; mariabeatriz.fernandez@gmail.com; lahumada@ucv.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Fern‡ndez, M.

The results: Barely one-third of Latin American sixth graders have a computer in their home, and schools where these children attend are unable to reverse this. Furthermore, there is a marked deficit of computers at home and schools in rural areas. Data shows that school performance in reading and math increases significantly among those students that have a computer in their home, an increase that is greater among those students that have at their disposal > 10 computers at school. In turn, increased use, both by pupils and teachers, improves school performance in both disciplines once the following variables are controlled: socio-economic level, family culture, gender, mother tongue and number of pre-school years.","[Roman Carrasco, Marcela] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Ctr Educ Res & Dev CIDE, Santiago, Chile; [Murillo Torrecilla, F.

Similarly, environmental variables of each educational system are included in the efficiency evaluation model; while these resources are not controllable by the managers of the education systems, they do affect outcomes.

Realities and discourses,revista de educacion,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,teachers; training; Secondary Education; competences; educational policies,,"The training of Secondary School teachers is currently an issue under great debate, both in Europe and Latin America. In the latter, the focus has been historically placed on Primary and Higher Education, whereas the key role of Secondary Education in promoting development and improving the quality of life of citizens has often been underestimated. This is strongly related to teacher training, an issue which has acquired certain relevance in the educational discourse. However, it has not been yet subject to substantive and systematical innovation and reforms. There is a significant incongruence between current learning necessities, the requirements of young people and competences acquired by Secondary School teachers once they finish their professional training. The author of this article suggests the need of considering teacher training in a broader sense, emphasizing the importance of developing a solid general training marked by contextualized humanistic, scientific and technological issues. The focus of the article is placed on pre-service training of teachers while acknowledging that the solution cannot be restricting to the development of adequate competences and capacities in teachers. The problem in hands is of greater complexity and is related to changes in young culture and the articulation with other teaching policies.","[Vaillant, Denise] Univ ORT, Catedrat Polit Educ, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Vaillant, Denise] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Santiago, Chile; [Vaillant, Denise] GTD PREAL Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay",,"Vaillant, D (corresponding author), Univ ORT, Catedrat Polit Educ, Br Espana 2633, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay.",vaillant@ort.edu.uy,"Vaillant, Denise/F-6853-2015","Vaillant Alcalde, Denise/0000-0001-8110-4634",,,,21,14,19,0,10,MINISTRY EDUCATION & SCIENCE,MADRID,"SAN FERNANDO DEL JARAMA, 14, MADRID, 28002, SPAIN",0034-8082,,,REV EDUC,Rev.

The proposed approach, based on project and problem based learning and ill-structured problem solving, was analyzed in the context of competence development and implications for engineering educators. The results of our action research indicate that the generic competences that were found to be significantly fostered were: systems thinking, ambiguity tolerance, asking questions, solving ill-structured problems, ability to apply knowledge in practice, presentation and generating new ideas. Professional competences that were found to be significantly fostered all belong to higher order thinking skills, and include the ability to design and evaluate, analyze, interpret and create new engineering solutions. These findings provide empirical support for the use of applied student-centered strategies for developing competences relevant for future work, as well as reflections that can support engineering educators in designing similar teaching and learning environments.","[Bozic, Marija] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, PhD Program Environm Educ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Bozic, Marija] Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile; [Certic, Jelena D.] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Telecommun, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, Serbia; [Vukelic, Milica; Cizmic, Svetlana] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Dept Psychol, Cika Ljubina 18-20, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Bozic, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, PhD Program Environm Educ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.; Bozic, M (corresponding author), Bernardo OHiggins Univ, Fac Engn, Ave Viel 1497,Ruta 5 Sur, Santiago, Chile.",marija.bozic@e-campus.uab.cat; certic@etf.rs; mbvukeli@f.bg.ac.rs; scizmic@f.bg.ac.rs,"Vukelic, Milica/K-3179-2019; certic, jelena/A-3892-2013","Vukelic, Milica/0000-0003-1744-9966; certic, jelena/0000-0002-8732-6251","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of The Republic of Serbia; Department of Telecommunications, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade","This research was carried out with the support of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of The Republic of Serbia.

Being physics a matter lying on the grounds of technical engineering it becomes naturally appropriate to introduce the use of calculus and programming as useful tools in the context of a physics problem. This can be accomplished by moving some Practical Classes of Physics (problem solving) into the computer pool and by reformulating the physics problems in order to make them more appropriate for this kind of approach. In this environment, students put together, for instance, programming tools and numerical methods, along with the physical laws in order to address more realistic models, different from those which can usually be treated on the blackboard. This kind of computational physics problems increases the motivation of the engineering students by embedding them into sceneries whose models are closer to those real problems they will be facing later in their professional and scientific life. This is particularly relevant for the first year of the engineering careers when the development of this kind of professional skills is usually skipped. In the present work we will illustrate these ideas by means of the known problem of The motion of a body subject to air drag force. The basic ideas of this work have been experienced in the physics course of first year undergraduate students of telecommunication and electronics engineering of Pinar del Rio University, Cuba in 2010.","[Castro Palacio, Juan Carlos; Crespo Madera, Elio] Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes de Oca, Dept Fis, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba; [Velazquez Abad, Luisberis] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Fis, Antofagasta, Chile; [Monsoriu, Juan A.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Tecnol Fis, E-46071 Valencia, Spain",,"Palacio, JCC (corresponding author), Univ Pinar del Rio Hermanos Saiz Montes de Oca, Dept Fis, Pinar Del Rio, Cuba.",jmonsori@fis.upv.es,"Palacio, Juan Carlos Castro/AAZ-7845-2020; Castro, Juan/AAZ-5724-2020; Abad, Luisberis Velazquez/M-2790-2016; Monsoriu, Juan A/L-6277-2014","Palacio, Juan Carlos Castro/0000-0002-0132-9989; Monsoriu, Juan A/0000-0003-3350-7951",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain)Spanish Government [DPI2008-02953],"We would like to thank the Department of physics of Pinar del Rio University, Cuba for the application of this problem in its teaching process.

The study is undertaken in the background of the general stance of engineering instructors towards students' professional skills development required by the accreditation agencies. It covers also the assessment methods to determine whether LLL skills have been acquired and some strategies employed to promote it. The paper opines that as technology advances in modern knowledge-based economies, industry and other employers will more and more require engineers who are multi-skilled, adaptable and who can operate flexible systems. Therefore professional engineers who are committed to LLL will be in greater demand. Qualified engineers who are less skilled or have no capacity to upgrade their skills or adapt to rapid changes will less likely find attractive employment. The role of instructors in understanding and applying LLL competency cannot be overemphasised. However, in general instructors are not usually sure about their knowledge of LLL and are to some extent reluctant to include lifelong learning skills development in their teaching. The conclusions are that the attitude of students, knowledge of instructors and the learning environment are critical in promoting lifelong learning ability of engineering students.","[Uziak, Jacek] Univ Botswana, Dept Mech Engn, Gaborone, Botswana; [Walczak, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Oladiran, M.

This collaboration began, by aiming to assess the development and impact evaluation of a participative and multi-disciplinary co-creation model, set up to design new products for self-reliant elderly in the Biobio region in Chile. Within a two-year period, several co-creation workshops with different interaction formats were conducted. The workshops were extremely valuable, not only in terms of design solutions, but also the participating students soon developed a high degree of empathy for the participating elderly, as representatives of a user group that was initially foreign to them. Empathy for their target users helped the students, not only with regard to determining requirements, but above all, with the design of an interaction that allowed suitably integrating elderly people into the design process. Examining these interactions revealed key elements of the learning process as well as the generic and specific success in teaching competences, an aspect that is directly sought by the industry. Based on these results, implications are derived for teaching user-empathy to engineering students as well as for curricula design.","[Wallisch, Anne] Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Werner Heisenberg Weg 39, D-85577 Munich, Germany; [Carlos Briede-Westermeyer, Juan] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Engn Design, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso, Chile; [Luzardo-Briceno, Marianela] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Secc Bucaramanga, Kilometro 7 Via Piedecuesta, Floridablanca, Santander, Colombia",,"Wallisch, A (corresponding author), Univ Bundeswehr Munchen, Werner Heisenberg Weg 39, D-85577 Munich, Germany.",anne.wallisch@unibw.de; juancarlos.briede@usm.cl; marianela.luzardo@upb.edu.co,"Briede-Westermeyer, Juan Carlos/Q-8766-2018","Briede-Westermeyer, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-5746-0169; Wallisch, Anne/0000-0001-8464-9373",CONICYT FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1171037],This research was supported by the CONICYT FONDECYT 1171037 project.,,64,1,1,0,4,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

Some literature claims that students have difficulties understanding this representation and relating it to their understanding of the electric field concept. We conducted a study at the introductory level that aims to understand the effect of students' interpretation of electric field line diagrams on their application of the superposition principle for the electric field. The results give some evidence that an incorrect interpretation of the electric field line diagram may hinder the understanding of the superposition principle. Students who understand a vector representation of a field at a position tend to answer a superposition principle question better.

The main hypothesis was that the spelling tasks would predict the handwriting status of the children, although this influence would decrease with age due to a gradual automatization of handwriting skills. The results confirmed this hypothesis. Another interesting result was that the pattern of pseudoword and irregular word spellings as predictors of handwriting status changed from Grade 1 to Grade 3. In Grade 1, the pseudoword spelling task made a significant contribution, whereas the irregular word spelling task did not. The opposite pattern was found in Grade 3. These results may be a consequence of progressive acquisition of orthographic representations. The orthographic role of the task of writing the alphabet in order from memory in the prediction model was also analyzed. The writing of the alphabet in order from memory task made a significant contribution to the prediction of handwriting status of the children beyond the orthographic influence of spelling tasks. The additional effect of this task on the prediction of handwriting status is presumably due to the fact that this measure is based on fluency.","[Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Villarroel, Rebeca] Univ Catolica Andres Bello, Caracas, Venezuela",,"Rodriguez, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Educ, Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion, Chile.",mrodriguez@ucsc.cl,"Villarroel, Rebeca/Z-1625-2019; Rodr’guez, Cristina/H-1021-2015","Villarroel, Rebeca/0000-0003-0401-2175; Rodr’guez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767","Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion from the Government of the Canary Islands [ProID20100030]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion, ref.

These sets of abilities are considered as separate but related domains with small to moderate correlations. The main objective of this study was to explore the relationship of intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior in adolescents with DS because previous studies have shown different relationship patterns between these constructs across other syndromes. Fifty-three adolescents with DS were assessed regarding their intellectual functioning whereas adaptive behavior was reported by parents and teachers. Participants showed a better performance on verbal than nonverbal tasks when assessing intellectual functioning, contrary to previous findings. Regarding adaptive behavior, higher social skills were reported than conceptual and practical skills. Intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior showed a medium correlation, consistent with observations in typical population. These results support the exploration of the variability across the DS phenotype.","[Sabat, Camila; Tenorio, Marcela] Univ Andes, Sch Psychol, Monsenor Alvaro del Portilo 12455, Santiago, Chile; [Tasse, Marc] Ohio State Univ, Nisonger Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Tenorio, M (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Sch Psychol, Monsenor Alvaro del Portilo 12455, Santiago, Chile.",mtenorio@uandes.cl,,"Tenorio, Marcela/0000-0003-0859-6462",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150800],"This work was supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT), grant number: 11150800.",,47,5,5,2,12,AMER ASSOC INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,WASHINGTON,"444 N CAPITOL ST, NW STE 846, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-1512 USA",1934-9491,1934-9556,,INTELLECT DEV DISAB,Intellect.

Two independent survey studies tested this connection. In the first study (100 centers, 714 workers, and 612 family members), results confirmed that burnout has a negative relationship with workers' perceptions of service quality. In turn, these perceptions are associated with the service quality perceptions of family members and their satisfaction with the service. In a replication sample (86 centers, 601 workers, and 819 family members), we reproduced these results and added situational constraints in the model. Both social and technical constraints correlated positively and significantly with burnout.

Method we evaluated 60 infants (10-36 months) with ABAS-II (32 with DS, 28 with TD). Using the developmental trajectories method for data analysis, we compared AB between the two groups. Results We found significant differences between groups in most of the skills assessed, in favour of infants with TD. Three different patterns of trajectories were found for the AB and the relation between the groups: (1) no differences (Leisure and Self-Care Skills); (2) differences at the beginning of the trajectory and then a similar slope (Home Living, Self-Direction, Social and Motor Skills); and (3) a similar starting-point with differences in the trajectories (Communication, Community Use, Pre-Academic, and Health and Safety). Conclusions This empirical cross-sectional study contributes to the understanding of the development of AB in children with DS, showing both weak areas and skills that continue improving over time in these early years.

However, there is little agreement among academics as to both the extent of knowledge required in particular skills and what is the right mix of the technical and professional skills. These two issues are reviewed in this paper in terms of graduate attributes from the perspective of employers of mechanical engineering graduates. A survey of Chilean industry revealed a significant discrepancy between the desired and actual graduate profiles with almost all attributes rated as relevant but not used frequently or vice versa. Interestingly, the least discrepancy and the least relevance were found for technical skills with particular reference to the design and conduction of experiments. The apparent importance of professional skills over technical skills is discussed in the context of employers' expectations that are not necessarily aligned with current educational programs. It was concluded that instruction in professional skills should be embedded into the technical courses to promote active, reflective and student-centered learning.","[Walczak, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Mech & Met Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Uziak, Jacek; Oladiran, M.

The design of this interferometer is based on the Michelson and Pease stellar optical interferometer, but instead operates at the radio wavelength of similar to 11 GHz (similar to 2.7 cm), requiring much less stringent optical accuracy in its design and use. We utilize a commercial broadcast satellite dish and feedhorn with two flat side mirrors that slide on a ladder, providing baseline coverage. This interferometer can resolve and measure the diameter of the Sun, even on a day with marginal weather. Commercial broadcast satellites provide convenient point sources for comparison to the Sun's extended disk. The mathematical background of an adding interferometer is presented, as is its design and development, including the receiver system, and sample measurements of the Sun. Results from a student laboratory report are shown. With the increasing importance of interferometry in astronomy, the lack of educational interferometers is an obstacle to training the future generation of astronomers. This interferometer provides the hands-on experience needed to fully understand the basic concepts of interferometry. (C) 2016 Author(s).

Children aged 8-11 years scored higher in some domains of QoL compared to those aged 12-18 years. The level of agreement between children/adolescents' and parents/proxies' responses was acceptable, except for the dimension Autonomy and Parents. Overall, deaf children/adolescents' self-ratings of HRQoL did not differ from their parents' proxy reports; however, differences were found in the dimensions that explored the quality of the interaction of children/adolescents and parents, the perceived level of autonomy, and social relations and support.","[Jesus Pardo-Guijarro, Maria; Martinez-Andres, Maria; Notario-Pacheco, Blanca; Solera-Martinez, Montserrat; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena; Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Social & Hlth Res Ctr, Cuenca 16071, Spain; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Autonoma Chile, Temuco, Chile",,"Martinez-Vizcaino, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Social & Hlth Res Ctr, Edificio Melchor Cano,C-Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain.",vicente.martinez@uclm.es,"VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/R-4336-2017; SANCHEZ-LOPEZ, MAIRENA/J-7933-2016; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/AAZ-9034-2021; Andres, Maria Martinez/R-4866-2019","VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; Sanchez Lopez, Mairena/0000-0002-0217-0623",,,,40,9,9,2,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1081-4159,1465-7325,,J DEAF STUD DEAF EDU,J.

On a monthly basis or more often, a majority of teachers reported they provided weaker writers with choice about writing assignments, the opportunity to complete an alternative writing assignment, and extra writing instruction via computer technology. How often an adaptation was applied did not differ by grade. The perceived adequacy of teacher undergraduate preparation to teach writing, their efficacy to teach writing, and the proportion of students with disability in their classes each made a unique and statistically significant contribution to predicting how frequently teachers applied adaptations for their weakest writers.

This paper presents the results from a funded teaching project aimed at exploring the use of the scientific poster as a tool to improve transversal competences in Civil Engineering students. To cope with this objective, a total of 68 civil engineering students from two different universities in Spain and Ireland were chosen. The poster design allows students to do in-depth research on a specific topic and to engage its research inquiry. The student's perception of this project was evaluated by means of two questionnaires surveyed prior and after the poster presentation. The research findings suggest that the scientific posters elaboration enables the development of different transversal competences of the students such as comprehension and integration, teamwork and leadership reinforcement, and effective communication. About 94% of respondents felt that this activity was valuable in improving their communication skills.","[Senent-Aparicio, Javier; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia; Perez-Sanchez, Julio; Leon, Loreto; Pulido-Velazquez, David] Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain; [Arias, Mauricio] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tampa, FL USA; [O'Driscoll, Leonard] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Rossa Ave, Cork, Ireland; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Geol Survey Spain, Rios Rosas,23, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Alcala, Francisco J.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ingn, Inst Ciencias Quim Aplicadas, Santiago 7500138, Chile; [Pulido-Velazquez, David] Geol Survey Spain, 4 Edificio Zulema, Granada 18006, Spain",,"Senent-Aparicio, J (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Civil Engn, Campus Jeronimos S-N, Murcia 30107, Spain.",jsenent@ucam.edu; pjimeno@ucam.edu; mearias@usf.edu; Leonard.ODriscoll@cit.ie; jperez058@ucam.edu; Lleon@ucam.edu; fj.alcala@igme.es; d.pulido@igme.es,"Pulido-Velazquez, David/D-7412-2013; Alcal‡, Francisco Javier/C-4533-2013; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia/ABG-1980-2020; Perez-Sanchez, Julio/L-2335-2017","Pulido-Velazquez, David/0000-0001-7985-0769; Alcal‡, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-8165-8669; Jimeno-Saez, Patricia/0000-0003-4733-7236; Perez-Sanchez, Julio/0000-0002-2615-6076",UCAM [PMAFI-PID-18/16],The researchers are grateful to the participating students for giving of their time to this study and would like to express our gratitude for the collaboration of the UCAM and CIT.

The TCM proposes MLD as a heterogeneous disorder, with two distinguishable profiles: a representational subtype and a verbal subtype. A sample of elementary school 3rd to 6th graders was divided into two age cohorts (3rd - 4th grades, and 5th - 6th grades). Using data-driven strategies, based on the cognitive classification variables predicted by the TCM, our sample of children with MLD clustered as expected: a group with representational deficits and a group with number-fact retrieval deficits. In the younger group, a spatial subtype also emerged, while in both cohorts a non-specific cluster was produced whose profile could not be explained by this theoretical approach.","[Peake, Christian; Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ Catolica Santisima Conception, Fac Educ, Concepcion, Chile; [Jimenez, Juan E.; Rodriguez, Cristina] Univ La Laguna, Dept Dev Psychol & Educ, Tenerife, Spain; [Peake, Christian] CIEDE UCSC, Ctr Invest Educ & Desarrollo, Concepcion, Chile",,"Peake, C (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.",cpeakem@ucsc.cl; ejimenez@ull.es; crodri@ull.edu.es,"JimŽnez, Juan E/A-6057-2008; Rodr’guez, Cristina/H-1021-2015; Peake, Christian/F-2282-2016","JimŽnez, Juan E/0000-0002-7466-8340; Rodr’guez, Cristina/0000-0001-9929-9767; Peake, Christian/0000-0002-7127-6501",Ministry of Science and Innovation of SpainSpanish Government [PET2008_0225]; CajaCanarias Foundation,"This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain, with reference number: PET2008_0225, and the second author is its principal investigator.

The objectives of the study were to identify sustainable engineering practices used by the Inca, determine which practices can apply to modern design and construction, and share findings with visitors at the National Museum of the American Indian and others throughout the world through live interactive satellite broadcasts. This paper focuses on the technologies that were used to accomplish the broadcasts and used to support the engineering and construction analysis of the Inca Road. Each technology used on these expeditions provided a unique opportunity to learn about the road and disseminate findings with others. The technologies utilized included communication equipment (e.g.,satellite router and dish, Wi-Fi, and mobile portable video equipment), location and mapping technologies [e.g.,geographic information system (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS)], photogrammetric techniques for three-dimensional modeling, laser range finding for precision measurement of the road features, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for use in nondestructive testing and evaluation of subsurface conditions. The technologies are explained in this paper along with the challenges of implementing them in such harsh and extreme conditions. In addition, some of the more salient engineering and construction discoveries are included. This information can be useful for others who are interested in implementing a similar approach for studying ancient civil infrastructure in other remote locations.

In particular we draw attention to the unwillingness of the majority of these employees to name or recognize specific forms of institutional inequality. Following critical pedagogy literature we argue that the Chilean education system reproduces a fear of talk among teachers working in areas with high density indigenous populations, which obscures unequal social structures and opportunities for specific (class, gender, ethnic) groups in school contexts. Based on data from 12 interviews with school staff and observations from four schools in southern Chile, we analyze how intersecting inequality is discursively reduced by predominantly white teachers to individual deficit, de-politicized geographical problems of access to schooling, and the normalizing of low achievement across schools with students from similar backgrounds.","[Webb, Andrew; Canales, Andrea] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile; [Becerra, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Villarrica Campus, Chile",,"Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Santiago, Chile.",Andrew.webb@uc.cl,,"Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670; Canales, Andrea/0000-0002-0391-1681","Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR), [FONDAP] [15110006]; Concurso Politicas Pubilcas [6030]","This research was partially funded by the Center for Intercultural and Indigenous Research (CIIR), [FONDAP Numero: 15110006] and Concurso Politicas Pubilcas 2016 No. 6030.",,44,5,6,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1361-3324,1470-109X,,RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK,Race Ethn.

The study estimates both the utility obtained by parents from different school attributes and the effective utility obtained with the actual school choice made by parents. The difference between both types of utilities provides a panorama on how market imperfections affect the general equilibrium of the education market. The results show that parents have different preference functions depending on their socioeconomic level. Nevertheless, regardless of the socioeconomic level, in all preference functions teacher performance remains highly significant. The findings suggest that even if parents would want the schools that serve their children to fulfill a series of academic criteria, they cannot use academic attributes when choosing a school for their children.

The present study developed a brief school-based intervention targeting the whole class with a focus on raising awareness of Gypsy culture, the educational aspirations of Gypsy students, and their experiences with discrimination. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 88 classes encompassing 1505 fourth and fifth grades students enrolled in Portuguese schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Control Group, Focused on the Domain Group (Gypsy culture), and Non-Focused on the Domain Group (general non-dominant cultural groups such as immigrants). These groups were assessed in three waves: pretest, post-test, and follow-up. Data from this longitudinal cluster randomized trial showed the efficacy of this brief intervention in decreasing reported social distance and increasing positive attitudes toward Gypsy people.

Although health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children has been described as an individual's subjective perception of the impact of health status on physical, psychological and social functioning, in very young children, a HRQoL parent-proxy report is needed since (pre)schoolchildren have problems expressing their feelings and understanding items on HRQoL instruments. In addition, the influence of motor competence on fitness levels has strong empirical support, so it seems reasonable to hypothesize that cardiorespiratory fitness might play a crucial role in the association between motor competence and HRQoL in children. Objectives:This study examined the association between gross motor competence (G-MC) and HRQoL in typically developing children, and whether this association between G-MC and HRQoL was mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods:An observational cross-sectional study with 1088 (pre)schoolchildren (51.84% boys, 48.16% girls) aged between 4 and 7 years (5.32 +/- 0.60) belonging to 21 schools in the Spanish provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real were included. G-MC was evaluated using the MABC-2 battery, HRQoL was assessed using the KINDL-R questionnaire and cardiorespiratory fitness using the 20m-shuttle-run-test. Partial correlations, covariance models and mediation analyses were conducted. Results:The mean scores of HRQoL (physical well-being, self-esteem, friends, school and global score index) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in children with higher G-MC. When cardiorespiratory fitness was added as a covariate, all the results remained unchanged (p < 0.05), except for physical well-being for the total sample as well as emotional well-being and the global score index for girls. Simple mediation analyses showed that cardiorespiratory fitness acted as a mediator between G-MC and physical well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.07]) for the total sample. For boys, it acted as a mediator between G-MC and physical well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.00; 0.08]) and school (Indirect Effect = 0.05 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.09]), and, for girls, between G-MC and emotional well-being (Indirect Effect = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.01; 0.08]) and the global score index (Indirect Effect = 0.02 [95% CI = 0.00; 0.05]). Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that good G-MC levels are associated with better HRQoL, mainly in global score index of HRQoL and self-esteem, friends, and school dimensions in typically developing children. Further, cardiorespiratory fitness mediates the association between G-MC and the physical dimension of HRQoL in (pre)schoolchildren. Additionally, physical and academic dimensions are mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness for boys and the emotional and global score indices of HRQoL are mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness for girls. These findings provide scientific evidence that improving motor competence and cardiorespiratory fitness might be a practical strategy to increase HRQoL in children. Thus, families and the educational community should promote effective interventions and incorporate opportunities inside and outside school that aim to jointly improve motor competence and cardiorespiratory fitness.","[Redondo-Tebar, Andres; Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel; Notario-Pacheco, Blanca; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Social & Hlth Res Ctr, Cuenca, Spain; [Fatouros, Ioannis G.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Karies, Trikala, Greece; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Talca, Chile; [Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Ciudad Real, Spain",,"Martinez-Vizcaino, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ctr Estudios Sociosanitarios, C Santa Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Spain.",vicente.martinez@uclm.es,"VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/AAZ-9034-2021; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/R-4336-2017; SANCHEZ-LOPEZ, MAIRENA/J-7933-2016; Redondo-TŽbar, AndrŽs/X-7827-2019","VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; Redondo-TŽbar, AndrŽs/0000-0001-5920-6159; Sanchez Lopez, Mairena/0000-0002-0217-0623; Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel/0000-0002-5127-0591; FATOUROS, IOANNIS/0000-0002-8475-8411","University of Castilla-La Mancha [2018-CPUCLM-7813, 3A2400/NL38532]","We would like to thank the schools, families and pupils participating in the study.

With the use of an intentional sample of 133, teachers selected from a total of 117 who were incorporated to other phases of the research trough the administration of a questionnaire especially designed, was show the predominance of a very fragmented image, sometimes contradictory, about the solution of problems and about relation between competences of scientific thought; this representation incorporates aspects of great value for the formation of the competent students, and at the same time it includes other aspects that in no way favor this formation, according to the present assessments. It is remarkable that both competences for scientific thought and solution of problems are not constituted as a totality and coherent system in the thinking of the teachers who participated in the research. It should be pointed out that we found data that show an oscillating valuation of the subjective character of the problematic situations and the problem itself; these data show, as well, that teachers give a very important role to language.

This reproduction is done via different procedures of shaming, silencing, and even sexual violence. We experienced the telling of these testimonios as troubling but productive.

However, some authors have questioned the validity of the instruments available so far, since their psychometric quality has not been evaluated satisfactorily. In this study, an established German multiple-choice instrument to assess scientific reasoning competencies has been translated into English and Spanish and the translated versions were evaluated based on the translation, review, adjudication, pretesting and documentation (TRAPD) approach. Based on samples of German (N = 497), Australian (N = 103), and Chilean (N = 135) pre-service science teachers, statistical analyses (e.g. dimensionality and DIF analyses) provide psychometric evidence for test equivalence between the German and the translated versions of the instrument. Known groups comparisons provide evidence for the valid interpretation of the test scores as measures of scientific reasoning competencies. It is discussed that further studies might evaluate additional sources of validity evidence for the translated versions of the instrument, particularly focusing on cultural specificities. Independent of this need for further research, it is suggested that the three versions can be used to assess the scientific reasoning competencies of pre-service science teachers whose first language is English, German, or Spanish.","[Krell, Moritz; Mathesius, Sabrina; Kruger, Dirk] Free Univ Berlin, Schwendenerstr 1, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [van Driel, Jan] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Vergara, Claudia] Alberto Hurtado Univ Santiago, Santiago, Chile",,"Krell, M (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Schwendenerstr 1, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",moritz.krell@fu-berlin.de,,"Van Driel, Jan/0000-0002-8185-124X; Krell, Moritz/0000-0003-2226-0383; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457",German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01PK11004A/01PK15004A]; Center for International Cooperation of Freie Universitat Berlin,"This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (projects Ko-WADiS/ValiDiS, grant numbers 01PK11004A/01PK15004A) and the Center for International Cooperation of Freie Universitat Berlin (research in Melbourne)",,69,7,7,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-0693,1464-5289,,INT J SCI EDUC,Int.

Substantial evidence has pointed to the (side)effects of these classifications, particularly in the most disadvantaged communities. Whilst previous studies have compared schools under different effectiveness categories within and between countries, this qualitative study takes a cross-case comparison approach to analyse education policies, grey literature and previous research evidence to explore the mechanisms that construct 'failing' schools in three notable high-stakes accountability systems worldwide: Chile, the USA and England. After describing (1) the identification and classification of 'failing' schools; (2) the instruments used to justify these classifications; and (3) who make these judgements, we conclude that the construction of 'failing' schools serves the competition and differentiation required for maintaining neoliberal hierarchical and unequal market-oriented regimes. Instead of disciplining only 'failing' schools, these labels also provide a caution for the whole school system.","[Munoz-Chereau, Bernardita] UCL, UCL Inst Educ, Dept Learning & Leadership, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Gonzalez, Alvaro] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Ctr Invest Transformac Socio Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Meyers, Coby, V] Univ Virginia, Dept Leadership Fdn & Policy, Curry Sch Educ & Human Dev, Charlottesville, VA USA",,"Munoz-Chereau, B (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Educ, Dept Learning & Leadership, London WC1H 0AL, England.",b.munozchereau@ucl.ac.uk,"Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/ABA-3272-2021","Gonz‡lez, çlvaro/0000-0001-6225-0409",,,,70,3,3,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-7925,1469-3623,,COMPARE,Compare,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/03057925.2020.1851593,,DEC 2020,20,Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research,PB2OH,WOS:000596166000001,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,compare-a journal of comparative and international education,Q3

Investigations have shown that aligning the design of learning experiences with students' needs creates synergy in the teaching and learning classroom processes. This can be achieved through orchestration, the guided integration of conventional and digital resources. This study seeks to investigate how orchestration increases student learning while taking into consideration their different pace of learning and monitoring the standards that the curriculum requires of a teacher. This is done by adopting a model which incorporates both the requirements of a school system's curriculum, as well as the students' specific needs based on their effective learning. It also seeks to determine which elements enrich the learning experience within an orchestrated framework. This study experimentally shows a significant increase in student learning when orchestrations are made available to teachers, when teachers successfully integrate technology into the classroom and when systematic use of the available resources is made. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of addressing weaknesses in each student's base of knowledge by adapting the activities in the classroom to their individual pace of learning.","[Diaz, Anita; Nussbaum, Miguel] Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Nopo, Hugo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Maldonado-Carreno, Carolina] Univ Los Andes, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia; [Corredor, Javier] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Psychol, Bogota, Colombia",,"Diaz, A (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile.",akdiaz@puc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl; hugon@iadb.org; ca-maldo@uniandes.edu.co; creivaj@gmail.com,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Nopo, Hugo/0000-0003-1769-2376",Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice from Chile [CIE01-CONICYT],"The research was funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and supported by the Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Grant CIE01-CONICYT, from Chile.",,31,4,4,1,18,"NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN",DOULIU CITY,"NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Although there are a large number of studies on the subject of culture, these are qualitative in nature and not focused on school contexts. Our aim is to develop a quantitative instrument for primary education that determines the cultural texture within an individual institution, as well as among different kinds of schools. For this purpose, Hofstede's original instrument was adapted, taking into consideration the characteristics and practices of primary school students. A factor analysis and complementary qualitative analysis of the factors obtained from 783 surveys (administered to third and fourth graders) led to the creation of five dimensions, which contrasted with Hofstede's theoretical dimensions. These dimensions include Value of School Achievement, Value of Institutional Structure, Resistance to change, Normative versus Affective and Value of Equality in the Production of Knowledge. Furthermore, this new set of dimensions was a more accurate representation of the school context and the values held by primary school students. Significant differences were found in three of the dimensions when analyzing the cultural differences of the sample and taking into account the students' socioeconomic background. These findings are important as they reveal the presence of subcultures within a given society, which are determined by belonging to a certain socioeconomic class. Measuring cultural values among primary school students contributes to the creation of educational models, the design of educational institutions and the development of public policy since new structures cannot succeed without adequate cultural support.","[Gelerstein, Damian; Nussbaum, Miguel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Lopez, Ximena] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Cortes, Ana] Syracuse Univ, Program Composit & Cultural Rhetor, 900 South Crouse Ave,239 HB Crouse Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Castillo, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Gelerstein, D (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Sch Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",dgelerst@ing.puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",CONICYT-FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150045]; VRI-UC Interdisciplinary Research Project [13/ 2014],"This research was funded by CONICYT-FONDECYT grant 1150045, and by the VRI-UC Interdisciplinary Research Project No 13/ 2014.",,49,0,0,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2210-6561,,,LEARN CULT SOC INTER,Learn.

However, producing MOOCs has shown to be a cumbersome and expensive activity for HE institutions. For this reason, many universities have started to explore and experiment with hybrid initiatives in which locally produced and third-party MOOCs are reused and integrated into traditional courses. Most of the hybrid initiatives described in the literature so far focus on flipped classroom experiences, although there are some other possibilities for integrating MOOCs in the curriculum. Moreover, few studies have reported on the institutional support required for implementing hybrid initiatives, and their benefits from a curriculum perspective. In order to shed some light on the opportunities that arise from the reuse of MOOCs, this paper presents H-MOOC, a framework that describes hybrid MOOC-based initiatives as a continuum of two factors: (1) institutional support to reuse an existing MOOC, and (2) curricular content alignment between the MOOC and the program, or the course hybridized. In addition, H-MOOC proposes indicators to measure the impact of these initiatives at both educational and institutional levels. Examples of actual hybrid initiatives and a set of guiding questions are presented to show how to apply the H-MOOC framework in different contexts.","[Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Assessment & Evaluat, Santiago, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Madrid, Spain; [Kloos, Carlos Delgado] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Kloos, Carlos Delgado] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Scalable Digital Educ All, Madrid, Spain; [Rayyan, Saif] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Perez-Sanagustin, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.",mar.perez@ing.puc.cl; ihilliger@ing.puc.cl; calario@it.uc3m.es; cdk@it.uc3m.es; srayyan@mit.edu,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Rayyan, Saif/H-9199-2013; PŽrez-Sanangust’n, Mar/G-8981-2015; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Rayyan, Saif/0000-0002-5961-4969; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963","Fondecyt ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Project The Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy [14ENI2-26862]; Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union; project MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; project SHEILA [562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD]; project COMPETEN-SEA [574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network [S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R, FPDI-2013-17411]","This work has been partially supported by the Fondecyt Project (11150231), the Project The Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy (14ENI2-26862), the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union, projects MOOC-Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), SHEILA (562080-EPP-1-2015-BE-EPPKA3-PI-FORWARD) and COMPETEN-SEA (574212-EPP-1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), by the Madrid Regional Government, through the eMadrid Excellence Network (S2013/ICE-2715), and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, project RESET (TIN2014-53199-C3-1-R) and fellowship FPDI-2013-17411.",,24,32,32,4,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1042-1726,1867-1233,,J COMPUT HIGH EDUC,J.

Proponents argue that choice would open up opportunities to disadvantaged families. Critics counter that choice may exacerbate inequities as advantaged parents are more likely to choose the best schools. Rio de Janeiro and Santiago provide unique institutional contexts in which to explore how choice may affect equity. We use datasets with information on home addresses to compare the choices of parents with different backgrounds. We find that disadvantaged parents in both cities are less likely to choose high achieving schools. The differences are more pronounced in Santiago than in Rio. These results suggest that choice policies will likely not reduce inequities and the design of the program influences behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is critical to enhance the preparedness of children against earthquakes through effective education and training. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) and serious games (SGs) are innovative digital technologies that enable realistic and engaging training environments. However, little research has been made on the applications of IVR SGs for earthquake training targeting children. In order to fill this gap, this paper presents an IVR SG training system based on a problem-based gaming framework. Three instructional mechanisms within the training system, namely prior instruction, immediate feedback, and post-game assessment, were investigated to promote learning through effective reflection. A controlled experiment involving 125 secondary school students aged from 11 to 15 years old was undertaken, using leaflets as a traditional training approach for the control group and the IVR SG training system as the main intervention. Results revealed that the IVR SG training system with post-game assessment was the most effective way to train children, with greater knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy improvement observed. Possible improvements, such as increasing the time for reflection and differentiating the stimulation between positive and negative feedback, are suggested for further research.","[Feng, Zhenan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Feng, Zhenan] Massey Univ, Sch Built Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mutch, Carol] Univ Auckland, Dept Crit Studies Educ, Auckland, New Zealand; [Amor, Robert] Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Feng, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",zfen124@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo/AAA-4172-2022; Feng, Zhenan/N-1336-2018","Feng, Zhenan/0000-0001-7513-8942",,,,100,5,5,7,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0266-4909,1365-2729,,J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR,J.

The objective of the present study was to describe self-perceived EBM competencies in physicians and medical students enrolled in a massive virtual EBM course. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study. People interested in a free virtual EBM course fulfilled their data in a virtual form for their registration in September 2020. In this form, 22 competencies related to four dimensions of EBM were evaluated: asking a clinical question, search, analysis, and application; using a 5-option Likert scale. The resulting database was analyzed, selecting people who claimed to be physicians or medical students of 18 years or more. Results 1793 participants were included: 1130 medical students and 663 physicians; more than 80% lived in Peru. The frequency of participants who agreed or strongly agreed with feeling qualified in each competence ranged: from 39.2% to 57.8% for the competencies of the 'Asking a clinical question' dimension, from 39.2% to 56.1% for 'Search,' from 19.9% to 32.0% for 'Analysis,' and from 19.6% to 29.9% for 'Application.' Both in physicians and students, the lowest frequencies were for the competencies of interpretation of impact measures, graphs, and results of systematic reviews; as well as shared decision making and calculation of expected benefit. Physicians who graduated more recently scored better on competencies from search and analysis dimensions. Conclusion Among physicians and medical students enrolled in the course, self-perception of competencies was lower in the dimensions of analysis and application. More recently graduated physicians seem to have a greater self-perception of their research and analysis skills, probably due to curricular updates.","[Romero-Robles, Milton A.; Sing-Sanchez, Caroline C.] Univ Nacl Santa, Escuela Med, Ancash, Peru; [Romero-Robles, Milton A.; Soriano-Moreno, David R.; Garcia-Gutierrez, Fabrizio M.; Condori-Meza, I.

These institutions all offer online education with diverse institutional, technological, and pedagogical processes. However, a fundamental element has to do with the experience of the students, and how they adapt to the educational model of the online university in which they are studying. In this article, we present the main results of the case-study developed in one of the most historical and relevant virtual universities in an international context. We have explored and analysed the process of adaptation to the educational model by the student body, and their perceptions of their interactions with the pedagogical, institutional, and technological elements designed to support their learning. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to gather and analyse the data. From 1715 students who participated in the survey and the perceptions of 30 students individually interviewed, the results show positive evaluations regarding the integration and adoption of technological competencies, and also, that the online education generally serves as a responsive model to the emergent needs of the learner. However, the results also show that students have important concerns regarding the pedagogical and institutional support provided.","[Rivera-Vargas, Pablo; Alonso Cano, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Dept Teaching & Learning & Educ Org, Passeig Vall dHebron 171,Edifici Llevant, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Anderson, Terry] Athabasca Univ, 10005 93 St Edmonton, Athabasca, AB T5H 1W6, Canada",,"Rivera-Vargas, P (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Teaching & Learning & Educ Org, Passeig Vall dHebron 171,Edifici Llevant, Barcelona 08035, Spain.; Rivera-Vargas, P (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",pablorivera@ub.edu; terrya@athabascau.ca; Cristina.alonso@ub.edu,"Rivera-Vargas, Pablo/I-3115-2015","Rivera-Vargas, Pablo/0000-0002-9564-2596",National Agency for Research and Development (CONICYT) [72090564],Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

This study provides evidence from a randomized experiment of a preschool intervention involving 1,876 children in 64 schools in Chile that chronic absenteeism develops in preschool and is predicted by multiple risk factors for poor academic achievement. We find moreover that individual children's likelihood of absenteeism moderated the intervention's impact on children's language and literacy outcomes such that there were positive impacts of the intervention only for children with the lowest likelihood of absenteeism. Experimental evaluations of school-based interventions that do not take absenteeism into account may thus mask heterogeneous effects. In the context of policy pushes to expand early education and preschool access in the United States and globally, these moderation analyses may prove essential for appropriately interpreting the results of experimental studies of school-based interventions.","[Arbour, MaryCatherine] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arbour, MaryCatherine] Harvard Univ, Ctr Dev Child, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yoshikawa, Hirokazu] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture, New York, NY USA; [Willett, John; Snow, Catherine] Harvard Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Weiland, Christina] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mendive, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Clara Barata, M.] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Trevino, Ernesto] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile",,"Arbour, M (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Global Hlth Equ, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",marbour@partners.org,"Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015","Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302",Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago de Chile; Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University; Harvard Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University; David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University; UNICEF's Chile country office; Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University; Hearst Early Investigator Award at Brigham and Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Fondecyt Iniciacion ProjectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11100493]; MINEDUC-FONIDE Project [F611106_2011],"The primary funder of this project was the Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad in Santiago de Chile.

Building on previous work assessing teachers' attitudes, we focus on how pre-service teacher attitudes vary across different dimensions, and how these patterns can inform teacher training. We present results from assessing attitudes towards stochastics and its teaching for a sample of 269 pre-service Chilean mathematics teachers across three topics: descriptive statistics, probability, and statistical inference. Using a quantitative approach, and considering attitudes towards content and pedagogy, we focus on describing the main attitudinal differences among these three areas. In general, we found positive attitude towards the content and its teaching in all three areas, but with differences among them, primarily in the area of statistical inference. We end with some proposals aimed at improving teacher preparation, focusing on helping pre-service teachers understand the utility and overarching process of statistical investigations.","[Ruz, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Estadist, Av Errazuriz 2734, Valparaiso 2340000, Chile; [Chance, Beth L.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Stat Dept, Fac Off Bldg East 235, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Contreras, Jose M.] Univ Granada, Dept Didact Matemat, Off 331, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18071, Spain",,"Ruz, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Estadist, Av Errazuriz 2734, Valparaiso 2340000, Chile.",felipe.ruz.a@pucv.cl; bchance@calpoly.edu; jmcontreras@ugr.es,,"Ruz, Felipe/0000-0003-4050-728X","Chilean Government (ANID) [72170025]; FEDER, SpainEuropean Commission [B-SEJ-063-UGR18]","This work was supported by Chilean Government (ANID) under a Ph.D. Scholarship No. 72170025, and by the grant B-SEJ-063-UGR18 (FEDER, Spain).",,60,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1571-0068,1573-1774,,INT J SCI MATH EDUC,Int.

For example, in the UK, 10%-25% of Gypsy children do not attend school regularly and have significantly higher levels of overall absence from school (percentage of half-day sessions missed) than pupils from other ethnic groups. In Portugal, available data on Gypsy children is sparse, yet data from one geographic region of the country reports high school failure (45%) and dropout rates (15%) among this population. The present study assessed the efficacy of a four-year intervention to promote Gypsy children's behavioural engagement and school success. Gypsy communities were contacted and 30 children participating in the four waves were randomly distributed into control and experimental groups. Every school day throughout four years, 16 children in the experimental group were called at home and invited to go to school. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated in four waves (at the end of each of the four school years), assessing behavioural engagement (i.e. school non-attendance, classroom behaviour) and school achievement (i.e. mathematics achievement, student progression).

At the micro level, some evidence is provided that not only middle-class skilful choosers but also the political representatives of private-dependent schools manage to pursue their interests drawing on economic, social and cultural capital. At the macro level, evidence also shows that the lobbies defending private-dependent schools can use and maintain these power resources.

Among the moderators tested, only transparency of orthography and use of timed or untimed tests were significant in explaining the size of the correlation, with the largest correlations observed between timed measures of arithmetic and reading and between math and reading in opaque orthographies.","[Singer, Vivian; Strasser, Kathernie] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Singer, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",vesinger@uc.cl,,"Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798",,,,103,12,12,2,24,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1045-3830,1939-1560,,SCHOOL PSYCHOL QUART,Sch.

Specifically, the instructional use of language would be the means for concept development. However, there is evidence to show that school concepts are particularly difficult to develop. Argumentation has been shown to promote the development of school concepts, but why is this the case? Although there are different theoretical accounts for this effect, none of them are developed from an explicit notion of what it is to understand and develop a concept. The purpose of this paper is to revisit these accounts in light of dialogical theories of meaning comprehension in order to shed light on this old problem. After discussing conceptual change and Vygotsky's theory of concept development, a dialogical notion of meaning comprehension informed by Bakhtin is discussed. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that imagination plays a central role in concept development and that argumentation is a powerful means for imagining.","[Larrain, Antonia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,"Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516",Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1140995],This research was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) project no. 1140995.,,67,9,9,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0256-2928,1878-5174,,EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC,Eur.

They took a test of divergent thinking, a test of creative problem solving and a fluid intelligence test. Additionally, they answered mind wandering, metacognition, and reading difficulties self-report scales. We performed multivariate analyses of variance, hierarchical regression models and tests of moderation. Fluid intelligence predicted performance on both creativity tests. The reading difficulties scale predicted the test of creative problem solving but not the test of divergent thinking. Mind wandering significantly predicted both creativity measures above the contribution of fluid intelligence and reading difficulties. Metacognition did not significantly predict the measures of creativity. The type of school where the participants studied moderated the effect of metacognition on creativity. We discuss the implications of these results for research and assessment on mind wandering, metacognition and creativity.

This longitudinal study employed the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 (CBCL) completed by the students' guardians at least once during 2018-2019 and again during 2020. The results showed differences in internalizing and externalizing problems after 8 months of quarantine and a significant increase in students fitting clinical or borderline categories given by the CBCL itself. The results are described in detail for four groups considering the combination of SEN and SES characteristics, showing the importance of their intersectionality, especially between low SES and SEN. Impact and Implications This work represents a rapid effort to inquire about the socio-emotional well-being of Chilean schoolers during extensive periods of quarantines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis considered how groups with different educational needs and SES have changed their well-being since 2018-2019 compared to 2020. This research calls attention to the need to respond with evidence-based data for those more affected. Results implicate that Chilean school-children have seen the most critical diminishing of their socio-emotional well-being during this time. Our results highlight the pressing need to provide parents and educators with tools to confront children's social and emotional development, especially for the more vulnerable populations.","[Santa-Cruz, Catalina; Donoso, Javiera; Rosas, Ricardo; Badillo, Dominic] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Justicia Educ, Avda Vicuria Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Espinoza, Victoria; Rosas, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, CEDETi, Santiago, Chile",,"Santa-Cruz, C (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Justicia Educ, Avda Vicuria Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",csantacr@uc.cl,,"Santa Cruz, Catalina/0000-0002-1074-6207",ANID [PIA CIE160007],"We have no known conflict of interest to disclose.

The data were obtained from analyzing videos filmed for a teaching assessment system implemented by the Chilean Government. The system identified four levels of teacher competence. I treated these levels of competence as an independent factor. The dependents variables of interest were frequency of teacher questions and follow-ups in four categories, social organization of the lesson and time on task. Most of teachers studied are clearly aligned with an adult-rum model of education. Evidence for adherence to this pedagogical approach can be found in (a) teacher questioning and teacher reactions to students' contributions, and (b) the place accorded to the teacher in the social organization of the lesson. The teaching pattern uncovered has its roots in the intuitive pedagogics endorsed by Chilean teachers, which in turn rest on Chilean cultural models of pedagogy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that the information originated from the writing and thinking assessments supplements the information provided by the academic measures. The inference and argument analysis tests did not replicate the achievement gap between public, voucher and private schools commonly observed in Chile.

The research sought to examine the association between parental motivational beliefs, parental perceptions of invitations for involvement, and parental perceived life context, and parental at-home and at-school involvement when controlling for child, parent, and household characteristics. Results from this study indicate that child invitations for involvement, parental sense of self-efficacy, income, and child's grade level are significantly associated with parental at home and at school involvement. Time and energy was also significantly associated with parental at school involvement. Understanding the importance of parental involvement as a protective factor in children's mental health, the article concludes with reflections on the findings for school-based mental health interventions. Specifically, the conclusions explore how to integrate family involvement initiatives and increase parental involvement, taking into account parental motivations for involvement in an international setting.","[Reininger, Taly] Univ Andres Bello, Humanities & Social Sci Fac, Sch Social Work, Ave Republ 252, Santiago, Chile; [Santana Lopez, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Reininger, T (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Humanities & Social Sci Fac, Sch Social Work, Ave Republ 252, Santiago, Chile.",treininger@unab.cl,,"Reininger, Taly/0000-0001-6398-5204",,,,48,5,5,11,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-0343,1461-7374,,SCHOOL PSYCHOL INT,Sch.

One factor that may explain some of these results is male and female students' motivation towards reading and books. The present study examined gender-related factors that contribute to explain students' reading motivation. One hundred and fifteen Chilean secondary students completed measures of reading motivation, gender identity and reading gender stereotypes. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that after controlling for language arts achievement, female students exhibited higher levels of reading motivation, in both dimensions: self-concept and value. Paired samples t-tests showed that all participants, male and female, viewed reading as a more feminine endeavor, revealing reading gender stereotypes. A multiple regression analysis showed that reading gender stereotypes explained significant variance in students' reading self-concept. Expressive identity traits (stereotypically feminine) as well as self-reported sexism both explained significant variance in the value that students associated with reading. The study offers empirical evidence about a relevant but understudied topic, especially in this region. These findings may contribute to the promotion of equal literacy development opportunities for students of both sexes in Latin America.","[Espinoza, Ana Maria; Strasser, Katherine] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Espinoza, AM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",amespin1@uc.cl,,"Espinoza, Ana Maria/0000-0002-1385-2830; Strasser, Katherine/0000-0003-2364-6798",National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161779],This study was partially funded by National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT) Doctoral Grant No. 21161779.,,87,2,2,3,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2890,1573-1928,,SOC PSYCHOL EDUC,Soc.

It connects emergent literacy research with historical-cultural and bioecological concepts. Subsequently, it focuses on the problem of the development of profiles of cognitive reading precursors. A sample of 63 Chilean adults was studied through a growth/learning curves approach. The study replicated previous results indicating the existence of three major profiles of these cognitive precursors. Together, these precursors are associated with significantly different learning curves beyond the effect of each precursor considered separately. In addition, it established a negative association between initial phonological awareness and the rate of reading acquisition during the course. It has been claimed that an individual's participation in specific cultural activities throughout his/her life influences the development of the precursors of reading. Based on a complementary biographical study of a subsample of participants, preliminary evidence is presented that supports this link. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, assessing the quality of life (QOL) of nursing students is important to determine if they have excellent well-being levels as they go through the learning process. Objectives: This study measured and compared QOL of respondents by country of residence, and identified the QOL predictors of students. Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional design. Settings: A multi-country study conducted in Chile, Egypt, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United States of America. Participants: A convenience sample of 2012 Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire containing demographic characteristic items and the World Health Organization QOL-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) was used to gather data from respondents. Results: The highest overall QOL was recorded in the physical health domain, whereas the lowest was in the social health domain. The perceived highest and lowest QOL dimension varied between countries. Age, country of residence, and monthly family income showed statistically significant multivariate effect on the aspects of QOL. Conclusions: Considering their stressful lives, the present study underscores the importance of ensuring the highest level of well-being among nursing students.

The implementation of m-learning in the learning process followed the ARCS model and was evaluated using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS). The Google Science Journal mobile application was used by the students in this study to determine the acceleration vector of a previously selected motor vehicle. The IMMS allowed us to measure the motivation of the kinematics and dynamics students from the Civil Engineering Department at Universidad Catolica del Maule. The instrument's reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha, giving an overall value of 0.89. The implementation of m-learning in university classrooms was positively valued by the majority of students surveyed, and it increased the percentage of students who achieved the expected learning objectives compared to previous versions of the course (without m-learning). Finally, this study provides a validated measurement model and solid scientific references, which aim to stimulate the use of m-learning. It has been shown that the implementation of m-learning favorably stimulates students, their interest in learning kinematics, and their confidence in themselves.","[Laurens Arredondo, Luis A.; Valdes Riquelme, Hugo] Univ Catolica Maule, Dept Comp & Ind, Talca, Maule, Chile",,"Riquelme, HV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Talca 3460000, Chile.",hvaldes@ucm.cl,"Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/ABF-3959-2021","Laurens Arredondo, Luis Alberto/0000-0002-2140-6275",,,,71,1,1,3,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

The study also addresses the role of imagery in viewing comprehension by distinguishing between audio-based, audio plus imagery-based, and imagery-based comprehension questions. Learners' lexical coverage was determined by measuring participants' knowledge of the words occurring in the documentary in an aural-meaning recall test, whereas viewing comprehension was measured by means of literal and inferential comprehension questions. One hundred and fourteen EFL learners took part in the study. Results showed an almost medium-sized correlation between lexical coverage and viewing comprehension (r(s) (94) = .39). Results also showed a positive almost medium-sized correlation between audio-based questions and lexical coverage (r(s) (94) = .36), and a small-sized correlation between imagery-based questions and lexical coverage (r(s) (94) = .29). No relationship was observed between lexical coverage and imagery plus audio-based questions. No threshold for minimum comprehension was observed. The results indicate that the lexical demands for viewing are lower than those for reading but similar to those for listening. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed.

Adult English as a foreign language learners from intact classes (N = 83) were assigned to four conditions: metacognitive instruction plus input-providing recasts, input-providing recasts only, metacognitive instruction plus output-prompting clarification requests, and output-prompting clarification requests only. Metacognitive instruction enhanced the effect of conversational recasts that otherwise had minimal impact but had no added benefit for clarification requests that supported language development without metacognitive instruction. Although the effect of metacognitive instruction was not moderated by linguistic structure, effectiveness of corrective feedback depended on linguistic target. Although corrective feedback in general impacted third-person singular -s more, the comparison of feedback types showed that the advantageous effect of clarification requests was found only for possessive determiners, the more salient and communicatively valuable structure.","[Sato, Masatoshi; Loewen, Shawn] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Sato, Masatoshi; Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,"Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019","Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [1160838],We would like to thank the four teachers who were generous enough to give access to their students and participate in the intensive feedback training sessions.

Method The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL in May 2016, for comparative research studies. For manual analysis of abstracts and main texts, they randomly sampled 250 HPER reports published in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, and 100 biomedical research reports published in 1985 and 2015. Automated computerized analysis of abstracts included all HPER reports published 1970-2015. Results In the 2015 HPER sample, P values were reported in 69/100 abstracts and 94 main texts. CIs were reported in 6 abstracts and 22 main texts. Most P values (>= 77%) were <=.05. Across all years, 60/164 two-group HPER studies had >= 80% power to detect a betweengroup difference of 0.5 standard deviations. From 1985 to 2015, the proportion of HPER abstracts reporting a CI did not change significantly (odds ratio [OR] 2.87; 95% CI 1.04, 7.88) whereas that of main texts reporting a CI increased (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.39, 2.78). Comparison with biomedical studies revealed similar reporting of P values, but more frequent use of CIs in biomedicine. Automated analysis of 56,440 HPER abstracts found 14,867 (26.3%) reporting a P value, 3,024 (5.4%) reporting a CI, and increased reporting of P values and CIs from 1970 to 2015. Conclusions P values are ubiquitous in HPER, CIs are rarely reported, and most studies are underpowered. Most reported P values would be considered statistically significant.","[Cook, David A.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Mayo 17,200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.; Cook, David A.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Multidisciplinary Simulat Ctr, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abbott, Eduardo F.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Escuela Med, Santiago, Chile; [Serrano, Valentina P.] Mayo Clin, Knowledge & Evaluat Res Unit, Div Endocrinol Diabet Metab & Nutr, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Serrano, Valentina P.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Nutr Diabet & Metab, Escuela Med, Santiago, Chile; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Utah, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Spencer S Eccles Hlth Sci Lib, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Utah, Ctr Clin & Translat Sci, Systemat Review Core, Populat Hlth Res Fdn Discovery, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Pandian, T.

The aim of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse pre-clinical and clinical dental students' written peer feedback provided as part of a continuous, formative and structured peer assessment protocol. Materials and methodsA total of 309 Year-2 and Year-5 dental students were invited to participate in a peer assessment and peer feedback protocol. Consenting volunteer students were trained to observe each other whilst working in the skills laboratory (Year-2) and in the dental clinic (Year-5). Subsequently, they followed a structured protocol of peer assessment and peer feedback using specially designed work-based forms during a complete academic year. The content of their written feedback was coded according to the UK General Dental Council domain, sign (positive or negative), specificity (task specific or general), and grouped into themes. ResultsA total of 108 participants (40 Year-2 and 68 Year-5) completed 1169 peer assessment work-based forms (516 pre-clinical and 653 clinical); 94% contained written feedback. The large majority (82%) of Year-2 feedback represented the clinical domain, 89% were positive, 77% were task specific, and they were grouped into 14 themes. Year-5 feedback was related mostly to Management and Leadership (37%) and Communication (32%), 64% were positive, 75% task specific, and they were clustered into 24 themes. DiscussionThe content of the feedback showed notable differences between Year-2 and Year-5 students. Senior students focused more on Communication and Management and Leadership skills, whilst juniors were more concerned with clinical skills. Year-5 students provided 13% negative feedback compared to only 2% from Year-2. Regulatory focus theory is discussed to explain these differences. Both groups provided peer feedback on a wide and different range of themes. However, four themes emerged in both groups: efficiency, infection control, time management and working speed. ConclusionA structured peer assessment framework can be used to guide pre-clinical and clinical students to provide peer feedback focused on different domains, and on contrasting signs and specificities. It can also present an opportunity to complement tutors' feedback.","[Tricio, J.; Woolford, M.; Escudier, M.] Kings Coll London, Inst Dent, London, England; [Tricio, J.] Univ Andes, Fac Dent, Ave Mons Alvaro del Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile",,"Tricio, J (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Fac Dent, Ave Mons Alvaro del Portillo 12-455, Santiago 7620001, Chile.",jtricio@uandes.cl,"Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013","Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828",,,,41,5,5,2,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the reliability, accuracy, educational impact and student's perceptions of undergraduate pre-clinical and clinical dental students' structured and prospective Peer assessment and peer feedback protocol. Materials and methodsTwo Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) forms were modified for use in pre-clinical and clinical peer assessment. Ten year two dental students working in a phantom-heads skills laboratory and 16-year five dental students attending a comprehensive care clinic piloted both peer DOPS forms. After training, pairs of students observed, assessed and provided immediate feedback to each other using their respective peer DOPS forms as frameworks. At the end of the 3-month study period, students anonymously provided their perceptions of the protocol. ResultsYear 2 and year 5 students completed 57 and 104 peer DOPS forms, respectively. The generalizability coefficient was 0.62 for year 2 (six encounters) and 0.67 for year 5 (seven encounters). Both groups were able to differentiate amongst peer-assessed domains and so detect improvement in peers' performance over time. Peer DOPS scores of both groups showed a positive correlation with their mean end-of-year examination marks (r0.505, P0.051) although this was not statistically significant. There was no difference (P0.094) between the end-of-year examination marks of the participating students and the rest of their respective classes. The vast majority of both groups expressed positive perceptions of the piloted protocol. DiscussionThere are no data in the literature on the prospective use of peer assessment in the dental undergraduate setting. In the current study, both pre-clinical and clinical students demonstrated the ability to identify those domains where peers performed better, as well as those which needed improvement. Despite no observable educational impact, most students reported positive perceptions of the peer DOPS protocol.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the levels of reflection habits of dental students and clinical and PhD postgraduate trainees and to establish the relationship between students' reflection and their academic performance. Materials and MethodsA total of 324 subjects (208 females, 56% 23years of age) from King's College London Dental Institute, consisting of 281 undergraduate and 43 postgraduate trainees, responded to the invitation to participate and completed an online self-reported Reflection Questionnaire; this assesses two levels of non-reflective actions (Habitual Action and Understanding) and two levels of reflective actions (Reflection and Critical Reflection). Reflection results were compared amongst different cohorts and correlated with students' academic performance. ResultsReflection Questionnaire mean scores were 10.7 for Habitual Action, 17.3 for Understanding, 17.0 for Reflection and 14.4 for Critical Reflection, with significant differences between cohorts of undergraduate students, clinical postgraduates and PhD trainees. Reflection and Critical Reflection mean scores were higher as students climbed courses. Further, those 24years of age and those with previous university degrees demonstrated higher reflective habits, whilst there was no gender difference. Additionally, the assessment programme methods correlated differently to the Reflection Questionnaire scores. DiscussionThe Reflection Questionnaire's internal reliability was acceptable. The most common approaches used by both students and trainees were Understanding and Reflection, whilst those with high Understanding scores also tended to have good Reflective scores. Further, multiple choice questions encouraged students to understand', whilst ill-defined problems, such as those from essays to clinical reasoning cases, increased this to the reflection scale. ConclusionTo foster reflective thinking, tutoring should primarily be focused on younger students (23years old) and those without a previous university degree. Further, a wide variety of assessment methods is suggested to stimulate different reflective constructs.","[Tricio, J.; Woolford, M.; Escudier, M.] Kings Coll London, Inst Dent, London SE1 9RT, England; [Tricio, J.] Univ Ios Andes, Fac Dent, Santiago, Chile",,"Tricio, J (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Dent, Guys Hosp, Cent Off 18th Floor,Tower Wing, London SE1 9RT, England.",jorge.tricio@kcl.ac.uk,"Tricio, Jorge/L-6498-2013","Tricio, Jorge/0000-0002-2364-9828",,,,61,16,16,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Moreover, our findings indicated little difference in demonstrated applied managerial knowledge across a wide range of management experience. In our student sample, we found only modest to small relationships between applied managerial knowledge and measures of cognitive aptitude, select personality characteristics, and academic performance.

Aim: The aim of this research was to identify the instruments used to measure the educational environment in health professions education and to assess their validity and reliability. Methods: We performed an electronic search in the medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE) and Timelit (Topics in medical education) databases through to October 2008. The non-electronic search (hand searching) was conducted through reviewing the references of the retrieved studies and identifying the relevant ones. Two independent authors read, rated and selected studies for the review according to the pre-specified criteria. The inter-rater agreement was measured with Kappa coefficient. Results: Seventy-nine studies were included with the Kappa coefficient of 0.79, which demonstrated a reliable process, and 31 instruments were extracted. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure, Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure, Clinical Learning Environment and Supervision and Dental Student Learning Environment Survey are likely to be the most suitable instruments for undergraduate medicine, postgraduate medicine, nursing and dental education, respectively. Conclusions: As a valid and reliable instrument is available for each educational setting, a study to assess the educational environment should become a part of an institution's good educational practice. Further studies employing a wider range of databases with more elaborated search strategies will increase the comprehensiveness of the systematic review.","[Soemantri, Diantha] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia; [Herrera, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Hlth Policy & Syst Res Unit, Santiago, Chile; [Herrera, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Evidence Based Med Unit, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile",,"Soemantri, D (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.",dianthasoemantri@yahoo.com,,"Herrera, Cristian/0000-0002-6219-7975",National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [11004336],"The authors thank Sue Roff and Sean McAleer for their comments and support in completing the project and finalizing the manuscript.

Gamification is a technique that has been shown to improve engagement, transferring the positive effects of videogames. However, the mobile games industry has identified that player retention decreases quickly over time, but it is unclear if this decreasing retention pattern transfers to gamification activities. To check if the behavioral engagement was stable over a 14-week engineering course, we gamified an existing virtual learning environment (VLE), conducting an observational study for two semesters. Actions performed by students within the VLE were used to measure behavioral engagement, which allows us to track student behavior weekly. To analyze the gamification effect, we divided user actions into two groups: academic and gamified. The results showed that the gamified actions performed by students in the VLE decreased every week, which was significantly higher than the decrease in academic actions. This shows that the decreasing retention pattern seen in mobile games was also present in this study. These results suggest that, just like in mobile games, to sustain the behavioral engagement over a long period of time in a gamified class, additional modern game-design techniques should be considered.","[Corvalan, Benjamin; Recabarren, Matias; Echeverria, Alejandro] Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile",,"Recabarren, M (corresponding author), Univ los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago 7620001, Chile.",mrecabarren@miuandes.cl,"Recabarren, Matias/AAZ-5945-2021",,"CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11130067]","The present research has been sponsored by CONICYT - Chile (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Fondecyt Iniciacion N degrees 11130067).",,41,3,3,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

As educators, we think that crowdcoding could be leveraged as part of the learning path of engineering students from a computer programming introductory course to solve local community problems. The benefits are twofold: on the one hand the students practice the concepts learned in class and, on the other hand, they participate in real-life problems. Nevertheless, several challenges arise when developing a crowdcoding platform, the first one being how to check the correctness of student's code without giving an extra burden to the professors in the course. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel system that does not resort to expert review; neither requires knowing the right answers beforehand. The proposed scheme automatically clusters the student's codes based solely on the output they produce. Our initial results show that the largest cluster contains the same codes selected as correct by the automated and human testing, as long as some conditions apply.","[Ferran, Sebastian; Beghelli, Alejandra; Huerta-Canepa, Gonzalo; Jensen, Federico] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Engn & Sci, Ave Padre Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile",,"Beghelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Engn & Sci, Ave Padre Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",alejandra.beghelli@uai.cl,,,,,,17,5,5,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

Method General surgery interns and research fellows completed four repetitions of a simulated laparoscopic knot-tying task at one-month intervals. Midway between repetitions, participants received via e-mail either a TD video (demonstration by an expert) or a PF video (video of their own performance with voiceover from a blinded senior surgeon). Each participant received at least one video per format, with sequence randomly assigned. Outcomes included performance scores and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of repeated practice, scores from these trainees on a separate delayed retention test were compared against historical controls who did not have scheduled repetitions. Results Twenty-one trainees completed the randomized study. Mean change in performance scores was significantly greater for those receiving PF (difference = 23.1 of 150 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0, 46.2], P = .05). Perceived workload was also significantly reduced (difference = -3.0 of 20 [95% CI: -5.8, -0.3], P = .04).

Furthermore, classroom walls could be considered valuable resources to introduce visual literacy among children and teachers. However, Chilean educational policies tend not to pay much attention to visual culture in the classroom. Hence, the selection of visual images displayed on classroom walls as well as the way they are exhibited should be more carefully thought through. Under the assumption that visual resources are pedagogically significant elements, the present investigation examined the images displayed on the classroom walls of the first year of primary schools in the district of Penalolen in Santiago, Chile. We present a comparative analysis of visual environments found in different administrative types of schools (municipal, subsidised and fully private schools), using a qualitative method, as well as a quantification of the sample schools. The analysis shows that inequality between types of schools reproduces in images, favouring private schools in aspects such as the degree of planning of the visual environment, student participation in terms of production, the aesthetic quality of the images and its iconographic variety.","[Errazuriz, Luis] Inst Estet, Jaime Guzman Errazuriz 3300,Campus Oriente, Santiago 6650008, Chile; [Portales, Carlos] Slaters Steps, Morgan Court, Flat 5 Room C, Edinburgh EH8 8PB, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Errazuriz, L (corresponding author), Inst Estet, Jaime Guzman Errazuriz 3300,Campus Oriente, Santiago 6650008, Chile.",lerrazur@uc.cl; carlosportalesg@gmail.com,,,National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT: Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientiifica y Tecnologica) [1120058],"This article is part of the research 'Everyday aesthetics in schools of Penalolen' (La estetica cotidiana en establecimientos escolares de la comuna de Penalolen), awarded with the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (FONDECYT: Fondo Nacional de Investigacion Cientiifica y Tecnologica), Project No. 1120058, (2012-2013).",,26,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1476-8062,1476-8070,,INT J ART DES EDUC,Int.

This paper explores the institutional campaigns against human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Spain between 2008 and 2017 and their role in helping to shape this issue as a matter of public concern. Our aim is to identify the ideological basis of these campaigns through their representations of predominant actors, which have been systematized to identify possible mistakes and to help determine more effective actions with a greater capacity for mobilization. We applied a mixed content analysis combined with a semiotic model to evaluate the presence or absence of the different actors and their relevance in each case. Several lines of discourse have been reiterated accross the 50 campaigns analysed: Curbing the demand for prostitution as a priority objective; the centrality of victims in the representations; the role of the consumer of paid sex as an accomplice to the crime; and the correlation between prostitution and human trafficking. We will also examine how these issues relate to the broader dispute on the status of prostitution in Spain. This will require a conceptual shift away from educational and social-oriented communication towards the structural causes, collective responsibility and transformative justice frameworks.","[Saiz-Echezarreta, Vanesa] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Journalism, Cuenca, Spain; [Alvarado, Maria-Cruz] Univ Valladolid, Sch Social Legal & Commun Sci, Segovia, Spain; [Gomez-Lorenzini, Paulina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Commun, Santiago, Chile",,"Saiz-Echezarreta, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Journalism, Cuenca, Spain.",vanesa.saiz@uclm.es; mariacruz.alvarado@uva.es; mpgomezl@uc.cl,"Alvarado, Maria-Cruz/AAA-5707-2019; Saiz Echezarreta, Vanesa/M-5503-2016","Alvarado, Maria-Cruz/0000-0002-1659-7249; Saiz Echezarreta, Vanesa/0000-0003-1700-0296",RAMP;D Project The construction of public affairs in the mediated public sphere [CSO2013-45726-R]; R+D+I Project Citizens' skills in emerging digital media in the professional field of communication [EDU2015-64015-C3-3-R MINECO/FEDER],R&D Project The construction of public affairs in the mediated public sphere (CSO2013-45726-R) and R+D+I Project Citizens' skills in emerging digital media in the professional field of communication (EDU2015-64015-C3-3-R MINECO/FEDER).,,37,9,10,2,12,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR 1,2018,26,55,,,,,29,38,,10.3916/C55-2018-03,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,GB4HD,WOS:000429020300003,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

The study aimed to investigate the utility of the Structured Professional Reasoning Exercise (SPRE), a new competence assessment method designed to measure dental students' clinical reasoning in simulated scenarios, covering the clinical areas of Oral Disease, Primary Dental Care and Restorative Dentistry, Child Dental Health and Dental Practice and Clinical Governance. Materials and MethodsA total of 313year-5 students sat for the assessment. Students spent 45minutes assimilating the scenarios, before rotating through four pairs of 39 trained examiners who each independently assessed a single scenario over a ten-minute period, using a structured marking sheet. After the assessment, all students and examiners were invited to complete an anonymous perception questionnaire of the exercise. These questionnaires and the examination scores were statistically analysed. Results and DiscussionOral Disease showed the lowest scores; Dental Practice and Governance the highest. The overall Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was 0.770, whilst examiner training helped to increase the ICC from 0.716 in 2013 to 0.835 in 2014. Exploratory factor analysis revealed one major factor with an eigenvalue of 2.75 (68.8% of total variance). The Generalizability coefficient was consistent at 0.806. A total of 295 students and 32 examiners completed the perception questionnaire. Students' lowest examination perceptions were an Unpleasant and Unenjoyable experience, whilst the highest were Interesting, Valuable and Important. The majority of students and examiners reported the assessment as acceptable, fair and valid. ConclusionThe SPRE offers a reliable, valid and acceptable assessment method, provided it comprises at least four scenarios with two independently marking and trained assessors. 3.","[Escudier, M.

We find that first time teachers perform significantly worse than their peers, and we find substantial class size effects. Hence higher education institutions face a tradeoff if they wish to increase admission. This tradeoff implies that as class size increases, at first the negative class size effect is smaller than that of introducing a first time teacher. However, beyond a certain level, the class size effect dominates and it is better to create a new class with a first time teacher? (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Main results include the notion that more than 50% of children were not able to detect advertising in examples containing ads. Lower recognition percentages were obtained in cases that combined persuasive content and entertainment and were not classified as advertising. For their part, adults perceived that their children recognize persuasive intent to a lesser extent than indicated by the children themselves.

Due to its versatility and multiple utilities, WhatsApp has been used within the educational setting in medicine and dentistry, proving a positive attitude of students towards its use. Aim To compare the reception time and the response time of WhatsApp with the traditional electronic email within the dental educational environment. Method A two-group comparative study was designed. Four multiple choice questions were sent via WhatsApp (group WA) and via electronic mail (group eM) to dental students. Data collected focused on the reception time and response time of students. Specifications of WhatsApp were used to collect data whilst an email tracker was used for the eM group. Excel software and Stata/IC version 15.1 software were used for data analysis. Results Seventy-four dental students from the University x (anonymised for reviewing purposes) dental school agreed to take part in this experience. However, 59 provided their responses (80%). Forty-four were females, and 15 were males. Twenty-seven participants were randomly allocated to the WA group and 32 to the eM group. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between groups: Reception time, P: .0286 value and response time, P: .0448 value indicating that the WA group was significantly faster in terms of reception and response time.

Methods: The content validity of DOPS was established through interviews and consensus survey. To be included in the new version, the respective domain should have been considered by over 80% of interviewers and it should have a Content Validity Index (CVI and kappa statistic over 0.78 and 0.6, respectively. For four months, the new DOPS was used to assess the intubation skills of the anesthesia trainees. Generalizability theory was used to establish reliability and internal consistency. Results: The interview suggested a DOPS with twelve domains. All were included in the final version as the CVI and kappa values were above 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. 585 procedures were assessed. The G coefficient was 0.90. The intubation needs to be assessed with DOPS at least six times to obtain a G coefficient of 0.80.

Exploring this debate, this article offers a case for the implementation of a more holistic and integral approach to mindfulness in educational settings. It will draw upon the philosophical legacy of Martin Heidegger and other critical theorists, who contest the dominant framing of neoliberalism and encourage engagement with more systemic perspectives. During this exploration, we examine two polemics: (1) whether mindfulness should be implemented technically or holistically and, (2) whether the focus should be individual and/or collective. The article concludes that although mindfulness may be an efficient 'self-technology' to improve certain aspects of individual well-being, it is necessary to challenge this perspective as it promotes a type of 'iatrogenic effect'. Specifically, it is argued that systemic failure is reframed as individual fallibility via a simplistic focus on well-being that may contradictorily foster appeasement to exploitative conditions. As an alternative, we offer a more integrative version, drawing in particular on the work of Ken Wilber, which proposes systemic as well as individual transformation.","[Brito, Rodrigo; Joseph, Stephen; Sellman, Edward] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing CRHF, Sch Educ, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Brito, Rodrigo] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing CRHF, Sch Educ, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.; Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.",rodrigobritopastrana@gmail.com; stephen.joseph@nottingham.ac.uk; edward.sellman@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Sellman, Edward/0000-0001-9124-5502",,,,75,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

For some critics the process carries the risks of instrumentalizing knowledge and of leading the university to succumb under the demands of the market or the state; for other theorists it represents a concrete opportunity for the university to open up to the real needs of society and for reorienting theoretical and fragmented disciplines towards the resolution of concrete and challenging problems. This article pursues three objectives. Firstly, we show that the debate is usefully informed not only by ideas of what a university is, but also by ideas of a profession (and, by extension, of professional training). We suggest that both ideas help to overcome the conflict between the two afore-mentioned antagonist perspectives. Secondly, we demonstrate that a certain understanding of a profession can prevent the risk of viewing knowledge exclusively as scientific expertise and reducing training to the acquisition of technical skills. The position on professions adopted here is inspired by the Scottish philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, whose work is instructive in understanding professions as rational practical activities, embedded in a social context with their own internal goods. Our third objective, therefore, is to argue, with MacIntyre, that the presence of professions within the university opens up the opportunity to rescue forms of rationality that are oriented towards action and, by implication, promotes spaces of training that are resistant to exclusively corporate or governmental interests and criteria of mere effectiveness.","[Serrano del Pozo, Ignacio] Univ Santo Tomas, Ctr Estudios Tomistas, Santiago, Chile; [Kreber, Carolin] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Educ Community & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,"del Pozo, IS (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Ctr Estudios Tomistas, Santiago, Chile.",iserrano@santotomas.cl; Carolin.Kreber@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,45,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

Vietnamese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL; n = 74) performed a communicative task in dyads in 15 minutes. Their positive emotional engagement was gauged using an Experience Sampling Method via a questionnaire that the participants completed after every five-minute interval of the interaction, capturing three timepoints of learners' emotional engagement. Learners' cognitive and social interactional behaviours were examined in light of the amount of second language production (words and turns), language-related episodes (LREs), and the degree of collaboration. Results showed that learners' positive emotional engagement fluctuated over the course of a 15-minute interaction. Also, learners' levels of positive emotional engagement were positively correlated with the amount of second language production and the degree of collaboration, but these relationships varied across the three intervals. No relationship was observed between learners' emotional engagement and LREs. The results indicate that although learners' positive emotional engagement may not be linked with their attention to form, relationships exist between learners' positive emotional engagement and their language production, as well as their social relationships. These relationships can be, however, subject to change over the course of a short interaction.","[Dao, Phung] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Arts & Humanities Bldg,Cavendish St, Manchester M15 6BG, Lancs, England; [Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile",,"Dao, P (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Arts & Humanities Bldg,Cavendish St, Manchester M15 6BG, Lancs, England.",p.dao@mmu.ac.uk,"DAO, PHUNG/U-6887-2019","DAO, PHUNG/0000-0002-8612-5589; Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [CIE160009],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533), as well as the PIA (CIE160009) received from the CONICYT, awarded to the second author.",,96,2,2,26,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1362-1688,1477-0954,,LANG TEACH RES,Lang.

However, definitions of context vary widely and the direct impact of the context is often unexplained. Based on research showing contextual differences in second language (L2) learner beliefs and interactional behaviors, the current project compared those factors in two distinct contexts: Chilean English as a foreign language (EFL) (n = 19) and Australian English as a second language (ESL) (n = 27) contexts. In this project, the learners completed a set of group discussion activities as part of their regular class work. They then completed a questionnaire pertaining to L2 motivation, perceptions of group work, and first language (L1) use. The group interaction data were analysed for: (1) the frequency of language-related episodes (LREs); (2) the initiator of LREs (self or other); and (3) L1 use for resolving LREs. The results showed that the EFL learners produced significantly more LREs. The EFL learners also used more L1 to resolve LREs. Factor analyses of the questionnaire data, conducted within- and across-contexts, showed notable differences in the two contexts as well. However, the findings of learner beliefs did not necessarily account for the differential classroom behaviors. We discuss our findings by reference to the socio-linguistic and socio-educational statuses of English in the two contexts as well as approaches to instruction which together shaped the learners' differential needs and purposes for learning the L2.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Storch, Neomy] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,"Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019","Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533]; Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [CIE160009]; Dyason Fellowship by the University of Melbourne [00065961],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT), awarded to the first author, and Dyason Fellowship by the University of Melbourne (Grant/Award Number: 00065961), awarded to the second author.",,85,14,14,7,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1362-1688,1477-0954,,LANG TEACH RES,Lang.

Postgraduate EE has been measured in hospital settings. However, there are no instruments available to measure the EE in postgraduate ambulatory settings. Aim: The aim of this study was to develop the Ambulatory Care Learning Education Environment Measure (ACLEEM). Methods: A mixed methodology was used including three stages: (1) Grounded theory (focus groups); (2) Delphi technique to identify consensus; and (3) Pilot study. Results: Three quota samples of approximately 60 stakeholders were formed, one as Focus Groups and two as Delphi panels. Eight focus groups were carried out including 58 residents (Latin-American Spanish speakers). The results were analysed and 173 items were offered to a National Delphi panel (61 residents and teachers). They reduced in two rounds the number of important items to 54. The 54-item questionnaire was then piloted with 63 residents and refined to the final version of the ACLEEM with 50 items and three domains. Conclusions: The 50-item inventory is a valid instrument to measure the EE in postgraduate ambulatory setting in Chile. Large-scale administration of the ACLEEM questionnaire to evaluate its construct validity and reliability are the next steps to test the psychometric properties of the instrument.","[Riquelme, Arnoldo; Solis, Nancy; Pizarro, Margarita] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Med Educ, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Padilla, Oslando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Publ Hlth, Santiago, Chile; [Herrera, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Unit Hlth Policy & Syst Res, Evidence Based Healthcare Programme, Santiago, Chile; [Torres, Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychiat, Santiago, Chile; [Torres, Patricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Student Support & Mental Hlth Programme, Postgrad Residency Programmes, Santiago, Chile; [Olivos, Trinidad; Antonio Roman, Jose] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Roff, Sue] Univ Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",,"Riquelme, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Marcoleta 367 Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",a.riquelme.perez@gmail.com,,"Herrera, Cristian/0000-0002-6219-7975","National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1 100 436]","This work is partially supported by grants of the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), FONDECYT no. 1 100 436 to A.R.",,30,14,14,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-159X,1466-187X,,MED TEACH,Med.

University-level EFL learners in a teacher training program (N = 102) watched a video in which two L2 speakers carried out a job interview role-play. The interview was scripted so that the job applicant produced 15 errors: five morphosyntactic, five lexical, and five phonological. While watching the video, the pre-service teachers completed a form to give feedback to the job applicant about four dimensions of her performance: appearance and behavior, interest and enthusiasm, content of responses, and language use. They also completed a doze proficiency test, the MLAT analytical ability test, and an interaction mindset questionnaire. Results showed that the learners reported few of the errors that had been scripted into the role-play. A regression model indicated that two subconstructs of interaction mindset (form-orientation and provision of peer feedback) predicted the number of linguistic errors reported. The findings and pedagogical implications are discussed in light of the relevance of interaction mindset to L2 learners' attention to form during task-based interaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods An online survey was carried out during the period July-December 2013. Forty-one representatives of early career psychiatrists of their national associations were invited to participate. Each respondent was asked to provide the collective feedback of the association rather than that of any of its individual officer or member. Results Thirty-two associations returned the questionnaire out of the 41 contacted (response rate, 78 %). All respondents recognized psychopathology as a core component of training in psychiatry. According to respondents, the primary aims of psychopathology are (a) to assess psychiatric symptoms (47 %), (b) to understand patients' abnormal experiences (33 %), and (c) to make nosographical diagnosis (20 %). A formal training course in psychopathology is available in 29 out of the 32 surveyed countries. In most countries, (a) there is not a defined number of hours dedicated to psychopathology, (b) teaching is mainly theoretical, and (c) a structured training on psychometric tools is missing. At the end of the training, about half of trainees is not satisfied with received training in psychopathology. Conclusions According to European early career psychiatrists, there is the need to rethink training in psychopathology, which should be at the heart of training in psychiatry and the key element of psychiatric practice. Education in psychopathology is affected by several unmet needs, such as lack of appropriate training in the use of psychometric instruments, lack of supervision, and lack of practical skills.","[Fiorillo, Andrea; Sampogna, Gaia; Del Vecchio, Valeria; Luciano, Mario] Univ Naples SUN, Naples, Italy; [Ambrosini, Alessandra] Univ G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy; [Stanghellini, Giovanni] D Portales Univ, Santiago, Chile",,"Fiorillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples SUN, Naples, Italy.",anfioril@tin.it,"stanghellini, giovanni/G-6009-2014","Luciano, Mario/0000-0002-4338-1371",,,,45,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1042-9670,1545-7230,,ACAD PSYCHIATR,Acad.

The course design was based on the dialogic technique and was aimed at clarifying the students' own values, defining their own positions related to ethical dilemmas, developing argumentative strategies and an ethical commitment to their profession and contribution to society. The online dialogue between heterogeneous groups of students based on their cultural background -the main innovation of this training- was possible thanks to the technological and administrative support of the participating universities. To analyze the effect of this innovative training we employed a quasi-experimental design using a control group, i.e., without the option of online dialogue with students from another culture. University students from Spain (University of Cantabria) and Chile (Universidad Autonoma de Chile) participated in this study. The positive results, which included better scores and positive assessments of both debate involvement and inter-cultural contact by students who participated in the new teaching program, support the main conclusion that the opening of international dialogue on moral dilemmas through new communication technologies contributes significantly to improve ethics training in higher education.","[Briones, Elena] Univ Cantabria, Evolut & Educ Psychol, Santander, Spain; [Lara, Laura] Univ Autonoma Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Briones, E (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Evolut & Educ Psychol, Santander, Spain.; Lara, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chile, Santiago, Chile.",brionese@unican.es; llarav@uautonoma.cl,"Lara, Laura/E-3709-2018; Briones, Elena/C-8422-2018","Lara, Laura/0000-0001-6420-2398; Briones, Elena/0000-0003-4521-4582",University of Cantabria,This work was performed under the framework of a Teaching Innovation Project which was funded by the University of Cantabria (school year 2014-15).,,35,12,15,3,39,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,APR 1,2016,24,47,,,,,99,107,,10.3916/C47-2016-10,,,9,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,DI4QP,WOS:000373484700010,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

In this paper, we compared the bonuses schools actually received on the basis of this formula to how they would have fared under a hypothetical alternative measure of school performance-intra-cohort gains between the 4th and 8th grades in 1996-2000. We show that schools that received monetary premiums for good performance under the SNED program were more likely to be schools that had scored higher on the 4th grade 1996 test, but, on average, they were not the schools that made the highest cohort gains as students progressed from 4th grade in 1996 to 8th grade in 2000. Given what we have found, to get more SNED awards, the wise school would do much better to raise 4th grade and 8th grade scores every two years (even years for 4th grade and odd years for 8th grade) and not focus on the more difficult task of helping students make greater progress from 4th to 8th grades. Although we have data on only one cohort's gain scores from 4th to 8th grades, our limited analysis demonstrates the possible constraints of a school-based incentive program when the available student performance data for awarding pay bonuses are inter-cohort rather than intracohort test score gains.","[Carnoy, Martin; Brodziak, Iliana] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Molina, Andres] Minist Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Socias, Miguel] Amer Inst Res, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",,"Carnoy, M (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",carnoy@stanford.edu,,,,,,28,7,7,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Students who overestimate costs are less likely to matriculate in any degree program and in their stated first-choice program, and are more likely to drop out. Students who overestimate earnings matriculate at similar rates to other students, but choose degree programs where past students have been less likely to graduate, have earned less early in their careers, and have been more likely to default on student loans. Consistent with an informal model of enrollment choice, students with a stated preference for labor market-related degree characteristics are less likely to overestimate earnings outcomes and choose degrees where past students have gone on to earn more, while the opposite is true for students with a stated preference for enjoyment of the curriculum.

Despite the common goal of discovering second language (L2) learning processes and products, the two inquiries have taken distinct paths. We argue that it is necessary to unite the knowledge and methods in the two inquiries, in order to answer theoretical and practical questions pertaining to classroom L2 teaching and learning. We make the case that the L2 classroom may be an ideal venue to explore the intersections of the two fields. Three intersections will be discussed. First, research can address the relationship between LP and interactional behaviors during classroom activities that have been investigated in ISLA research. Second, the roles of teachers, the classroom environment, and instruction - the primary variables in ISLA research - can be examined in relation to LP in the classroom. Third, research can target LP as a dependent variable in experimental designs that ISLA research often employs. LP is a primary concern of L2 teachers who face a range of LP (unmotivated students, silent students, anxious students, etc.). Some teachers are also concerned about the potential negative impact of a certain instructional technique on LP. Thus, combining LP and ISLA perspectives helps answer various pedagogical concerns, whether these are related to particular LP issues, or the impact of instructional techniques on LP. Throughout the article, we propose future research topics and make pedagogical recommendations addressing LP in the classroom.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Csizer, Kata] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,,"Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533]; PIA from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [CIE160009];  [NKFIH-129149],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT), awarded to the first author, and NKFIH-129149 awarded to the second author.",,103,1,1,14,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1362-1688,1477-0954,,LANG TEACH RES,Lang.

A nonexperimental quantitative research design was utilised in this study because two psychological scales have been applied, considering a random cluster sample, which is understood as a probability sampling because the number of participants has representativeness in the Spanish primary education system. Results demonstrate that music teachers work alone at schools, such that they have limited chances for interacting with other music educators at the workplace. In conclusion, job isolation is the turning point for understanding the motivational status of music teachers, at least in Spain.

The aim of the present research is to investigate about primary-age children's habits with these tools, as well as these children's perception of parental mediation in this area. In this study we used an ex post facto descriptive methodology by survey. A questionnaire was applied for data recollection to 422 children of private schools in Santiago de Chile aged between 9 and 12 years old. The results point to an early access to electronic devices and the transversal and homogeneous use during childhood. There is no doubt that ICTs play an active role in daily life for most of these children. No significant differences in age or sex were detected in our study, but we encountered risky behaviours in how children use ICTs and in their perception of parental mediation. The complexity becomes more evident the more time they have with electronic devices connected to the Internet without adult supervision. This finding raises the need for the application of intervention programs on parental mediation of children's use of ICTs in order to promote a safe, responsible and ethical use of these tools.","[Berrios, Llarela; Garces, Maria-Soledad] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile; [Buxarrais, Maria-Rosa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Theory & Hist Educ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",,"Berrios, L (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile.",llarela.berrios@uandes.cl; mrbuxarrais@ub.edu; sgarces@uandes.cl,,"Buxarrais, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-7511-3814; Berrios, Llarela/0000-0002-0716-8610",,,,27,16,17,0,30,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JUL 1,2015,23,45,,,,,161,168,,10.3916/C45-2015-17,,,8,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,DB5DR,WOS:000368534800017,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven high school teachers and five deaf education teachers, to explore their practices and beliefs regarding teaching D/HH students in regular classrooms. Ten classroom observations were also carried out in classes with and without the presence of a deaf education teacher. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Class observations enabled a better understanding of the context in which D/HH students and their teachers interact daily. Results from interview analysis provided information of teachers' beliefs about D/HH students; regular teachers and deaf education teachers' perceptions of the roles they play in students' learning; accommodations made for D/HH students; and facilitators and barriers for teaching in classes with D/HH students. High school teachers' report of their difficulties to teach D/HH students and their need to rely on deaf education teachers in the classroom was corroborated by classroom observations, which showed that most D/HH students were unable to follow the class in absence of special teacher's support, and regular teachers had problems communicating with them. D/HH students' opportunities for learning are highly restricted in such environment. Implications for educational inclusion policies and teacher preparation programs are discussed.","[Rosa Lissi, Maria; Iturriaga, Cristian; Sebastian, Christian; Vergara, Martin; Henriquez, Catalina; Hofmann, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Lissi, MR (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",mlissi@uc.cl,,"Vergara Wilson, Martin/0000-0002-0454-4924; Lissi, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-9740-6853; Iturriaga, Cristian/0000-0002-0081-8692",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [National Fund for Science and Technology Development] [1130966],This study was funded by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [National Fund for Science and Technology Development].

We conducted a topographical review of 48 articles from Latin America published in eight core EDLM journals published between 1991 and 2017. Data analysis focused on analyzing identified modal trends as well as highlighting variability in patterns of knowledge production. Notably, 75% of the studies had been published in the past 10 years, and 56% in the past five years. Geographic coverage was highly uneven across Latin America. While there were 19 articles from Chile, numerous Latin American societies were unrepresented in the database. Almost 80% of the corpus consisted of empirical studies and topical foci were highly diverse. Comparison of these results with findings reported in recent reviews of EDLM research from other developing societies yielded recommendations for enhancing research capacity and output in Latin America. A key limitation of the review was its exclusion of local language sources. This led to the further recommendation for Latin American scholars to undertake broader multi-language reviews of the EDLM knowledge base in Latin America.","[Aravena Castillo, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Hallinger, Philip] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, Ctr Res Sustainable Leadership, Leadership, Bangkok, Thailand; [Hallinger, Philip] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Educ Leadership & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",,"Hallinger, P (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 Vipawadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",hallinger@gmail.com,"Hallinger, Philip/H-6071-2013","Hallinger, Philip/0000-0002-5935-7544",,,,74,39,44,5,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated. It is hoped that this study will provide additional guidance for future Latin-American and other LA initiatives.","[Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LESEC, Leuven, Belgium; [Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Augment HCI Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Engn Sch, Assessment & Evaluat, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Nyi-Nyi Htun] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200A,Box 2402, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Millecamp, Martijn] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Human Comp Interact Grp, Augment, Leuven, Belgium; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola; Solano-Quinde, Lizandro; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena; Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel] Univ Cuenca, Fac Engn, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola; Solano-Quinde, Lizandro; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena; Zuniga-Prieto, Miguel] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Verbert, Katrien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, HCI Res Grp, Leuven, Belgium; [De Laet, Tinne] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Engn Sci, Leuven, Belgium",,"Broos, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200A,Box 2402, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",tom.broos@kuleuven.be,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Broos, Tom/F-5424-2017; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","verbert, katrien/0000-0001-6699-7710; Siguenza-Guzman, Lorena/0000-0003-1367-5288; Broos, Tom/0000-0002-4139-2608; Htun, Nyi Nyi/0000-0001-9604-4056; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; De Laet, Tinne/0000-0003-0624-3305",Erasmus + Programme of the European Union [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP],This work was supported by the Erasmus + Programme of the European Union [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP].,,21,3,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

This paper explores four principals' leadership journeys in response to social justice issues in increasingly diverse settings within public schools, in relation to demographic and cultural changes in Hong Kong. This research aims at exploring the issues in schools arising from contextual changes in the society, contextualising characteristics of principals' practices in relation to an emergent conception of democratic leadership practice in addressing the issues and identifying practical roles of democratic principal leadership in school transformation for diverse students' learning development. I adopted a cross-case study of the principals' leadership journeys through a theoretical lens of democratic leadership. The changes of demographic structure and cultural context and pressure from the central administration were the conditions of facilitating alternative practices of democratic principal leadership in a multicultural school context which evolved from the hybrid of Western and Confucian cultures in the city. These findings contribute to an international account of contextualising democratic leadership practices in a diverse Chinese school community.","[Szeto, Elson] Ctr Special Educ Needs & Inclus Educ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Elson] Dept Educ Policy & Leadership, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Szeto, Elson] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Szeto, E (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",eszeto@eduhk.hk,,"Szeto, Elson/0000-0002-8616-1221",,,,59,1,1,2,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

The Portuguese prison system, similar to other prison systems (e.g. England), offers prison-based educational programmes so inmates can complete compulsory education. However, the completion rate of these educational programmes is low, and the dropout rate is high. Deepening our understanding of how inmates conceptualise learning and how they engage in learning will improve the quality of the prison-based educational services and promote school enrolment. Data from a phenomenographic study of 30 Portuguese inmate students, ranging from 20 to 58years of age, revealed an understanding of learning focused on the instrumental role of knowledge and its application in the short-term (e.g. learning how to read) and on integration in the prison system (e.g. learning how to play draughts to fit in the yard). Moreover, a broader understanding of learning that reflected particular forms of learning favoured within the prison context also emerged in the discourse. Forexample, learning was described as an opportunity to reflect upon their previous offence and behaviours and on the need to avoid violence. Participants also stressed the importance of setting an academic example for their children by engaging actively in learning and the significance of occupying one's time in prison in a positive and beneficial manner. Findings allow a first approach to prison students' involvement in school learning by listening to the inmates' opinions and thoughts, and they offer promising suggestions to improve the organisation of prison-based educational programmes.","[Rosario, Pedro; Pereira, Joana; Cunha, Jennifer] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunez, Jose] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Gaeta, Martha] Univ Popular Autonoma Estado Puebla, Santiago, Spain; [Polydoro, Soely] Univ Estadual Campinas, BR-13081970 Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Escola Psicol, Campus Gualtar, P-4710 Braga, Portugal.",prosario@psi.uminho.pt,"Cunha, Jennifer/AAZ-7844-2020; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/H-4425-2013; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Gaeta, Martha/AAN-4052-2021; Ros‡rio, Pedro/A-1775-2011","Cunha, Jennifer/0000-0001-8604-2049; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Ros‡rio, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Polydoro, Soely/0000-0003-4823-3228",,,,64,3,3,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-1926,1469-3518,,BRIT EDUC RES J,Br.

According to existing literature, self-regulated learning (SRL) research in MOOCs is still scarce. More studies which build on past works regarding SRL in MOOCs are required, as well as literature reviews that help to identify the main challenges and future research directions in relation to this area. In this paper, the authors present the results of a systematic literature review on SRL in MOOCs, covering all the related papers published until the end of 2017. The papers considered in this review include real experiences with at least a MOOC (other learning scenarios sometimes claimed as MOOCs, such as blended courses, or online courses with access restrictions, are out of the scope of this analysis). Most studies on SRL in MOOCs share some common features: they are generally exploratory, based on one single MOOC and tend not to specify in which SRL model they are grounded. The results reveal that high self-regulators engage in non-linear navigation and approach MOOCs as an informal learning opportunity. In general, they prefer setting specific goals based on knowledge development and control their learning through assignments.","[Elena Alonso-Mencia, M.; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Estevez-Ayres, Iria; Delgado Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Avda Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, IRIT, Toulouse, France",,"Alario-Hoyos, C (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Telemat Engn, Avda Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.",calario@it.uc3m.es,"Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/X-6670-2019; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011","Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Kloos, Carlos Delgado/0000-0003-4093-3705; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Estevez-Ayres, Iria/0000-0002-1047-5398; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X","CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL [21160081]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, 574212-EPP -1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Madrid Regional Government [S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]",This work was supported by the CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL 2016 [Grant Number 21160081]; European Commission [Grant Numbers 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP and 574212-EPP -1-2016-1-NL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [Grant Number 11150231]; Madrid Regional Government [Grant Number S2013/ICE-2715]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Grant Number TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R].,,79,13,13,12,93,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1911,1465-3397,,EDUC REV,Educ.

One pedagogical activity used to promote global competencies is the participation of students in multinational design projects. This is a problem-based learning approach in an international setting, where students get immersed in the solution of an engineering design task while they work in teams and collaborate with international partners. The main goal of these projects is to foster international collaboration and to offer an opportunity to the students to develop professional skills through international teamwork effort in the solution of a design problem. However, a real challenge of this practice has been to create an effective interaction among the students participating in this type of projects and to maintain the flow of information, and student engagement in the project and in their learning. The main objective of this work is to investigate the sociotechnical interaction of engineering students working in a multinational collaborative project and the role of information technology tools and the nature of the interaction in this experience. For this purpose an assessment tool was developed and used to determine the interaction among the students (frequency, quantity and quality), the value of social interaction in the flow of the interaction, and the impact of the interaction in the development of the project. The main findings of this instrument are presented in this work.","[Esparragoza, I. E.] Penn State Univ, Sch Engn Design Technol & Profess Programs, Media, PA 19063 USA; [Farak, S.

In the past few years, strategies have been generated to optimize the use of technological resources with the aim of facilitating widespread adoption of technology in the classroom. Given its low acquisition and maintenance costs, the interpersonal computer allows individual interaction and simultaneous learning with large groups of students. The purpose of this work was to compare arithmetical knowledge acquired by third-grade students through the use of game-based activities and non-game-based activities using an interpersonal computer, with knowledge acquired through the use of traditional paper-and-pencil activities, and to analyze their impact in various socio-cultural contexts. To do this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with 271 students in three different countries (Brazil, Chile, and Costa Rica), in both rural and urban schools. A set of educational games for practising arithmetic was developed and tested in six schools within these three countries. Results show that there were no significant differences (ANCOVA) in the learning acquired from game-based vs. non-game-based activities. However, both showed a significant difference when compared with the traditional method. Additionally, both groups using the interpersonal computer showed higher levels of student interest than the traditional method group, and these technological methods were seen to be especially effective in increasing learning among weaker students.","[Beserra, Vagner; Nussbaum, Miguel; Wurman, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Zeni, Ricardo] Univ Estadual Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rodriguez, Werner] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"Beserra, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",vagner.beserra@gmail.com; mn@ing.puc.cl; jrzeni@feg.unesp.br; werner.rodriguez@ucr.ac.cr; gabow4@gmail.com,"Beserra, Vagner/AAG-9897-2020; Beserra, Vagner/C-4890-2015; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Beserra, Vagner/0000-0001-6775-5748; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",,,,32,11,11,1,18,"NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN",DOULIU CITY,"NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNKIN COUNTY, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

To that end, we use data from PISA, TERCE, and TIMSS, as they operationalize socio-economic status somewhat differently. As part of our analysis, we examine whether TERCE, a Latin American study - with measures that are regionally developed - exhibits better psychometric properties than measures that are designed to function across a larger and more diverse number of educational systems. We also examine TIMSS, a trends focused study - that has historically emphasized consistency and comparison. Finally, we include PISA which has the largest number of participants and has changed and conceptualized a great deal of its background questionnaire depending on the study's major domain and focus. Our findings suggest that none of the socioeconomic background scales we analyzed are fully invariant in any of the three studies, and therefore comparisons across countries should be done with caution.

Although the results regarding the relationship between approaches to studying and course experiences were largely consistent with previous findings, we highlight the different roles of good teaching and appropriate workload in the two samples.

The research literature on learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) has started to deal with these issues. This paper presents a systematic literature review of LD and LA, in m/u-learning. Apart from providing an overview of the current research in the field, this review elicits elements of common ground between both communities, as shown by the similar learning contexts and complementary research contributions, and based on the research gaps, proposes to: address m/u-learning beyond higher education settings, reinforce the connection between physical and virtual learning spaces, and more systematically align LD and LA processes.","[Pishtari, Gerti; Rodriguez-Triana, Maria J.] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Sarmiento-Marquez, Edna M.; Prieto, Luis P.; Valjataga, Terje] Tallinn Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Tallinn, Estonia; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ruiz-Calleja, Adolfo; Serrano-Iglesias, Sergio] Valladolid Univ, GSIC, Valladolid, Spain; [Santos, Patricia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Informat & Commun Technol Dept, Barcelona, Spain",,"Pishtari, G (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ, Narva Maantee 25, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.",gerti.pishtari@tlu.ee; lprisan@tlu.ee; sergio@gsic.uva.es,"Prieto, Luis P./K-4236-2015; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014; Rodriguez Triana, Maria Jesus/A-6019-2015","Prieto, Luis P./0000-0002-0057-0682; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; Rodriguez Triana, Maria Jesus/0000-0001-8639-1257; Valjataga, Terje/0000-0001-8109-0674","EUEuropean Commission [669074, 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Spanish projectsSpanish Government [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-3-R, VA257P18]","This research was partially funded by EU grants 669074, 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP, and Spanish projects TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-3-R, VA257P18.",,76,12,12,9,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

Training programs for present or future school leaders have proliferated in the region, often publicly financed, but without enough evidence of their impact. Using data for seven Latin American countries from the Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE), we seek to determine the association between school leaders' formal education and training received, with well recognized dimensions of school leadership practices reported by their teachers. We estimated linear regression models for each country in Latin America to determine the relationship between principals' preparation with indicators of educational leadership practices. Our results show that in most observed indicators of leadership practices the effect of education or training is marginal. We provide possible explanations for this finding, emphasizing the weaknesses in principals' initial selection processes and their deficiencies. We also consider schools' precarious conditions to support principals in order to put the knowledge they learned in training activities into practice. We point out the need to continue conducting specific studies on the effects of training on educational leadership among school leaders in the region, overcoming TERCE information restrictions.","[Weinstein, Jose] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile; [Weinstein, Jose] CEDLE Chile, Ctr Dev Educ Leadership, Santiago, Spain; [Azar, Ariel] Univ Chicago, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Flessa, Joseph] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Educ Leadership & Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Weinstein, J (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Educ, Santiago Ctr, Vergara 249,Tercer Piso, Santiago, Chile.",jose.weinstein@gmail.com,,,,,,62,5,5,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1741-1432,1741-1440,,EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD,Educ.

Nevertheless, the nature of this phenomenon among adults with intellectual disabilities has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the frequency and characteristics of cyberbullying and its correlates in individuals with intellectual disabilities attending training centers for adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods and procedures: A convenience sample of 269 participants (54.3% men and 35.7% women), aged 18-40 years was recruited from Chile (14.1%), Mexico (32%), and Spain (53.9%). Results: The findings showed that 15.2% have been cyberbullied 9.7% are currently being cyberbullied. Being different was the main reason (97.7%) for being cyberbullied. The behaviors happen in educational settings (46.67%), leisure/free time activities (31.11%), and associations for people with disabilities (15.56%). Verbal aggressions (74.53%) were the most common cyberbullying behaviors. Those who were cyberbullied reported more inadequate use of mobile phone and Internet, as well as more unhealthy behaviors and depressive mood. Conclusions and implications: These findings support the need for further studies on adults with intellectual disabilities, as well as the need for implementing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs.","[Jenaro, Cristina; Flores, Noelia] Univ Salamanca, INICO Inst Univ Integrat Comunidad, Fac Psicol, Avda Merced 109-131, Salamanca 37005, Spain; [Vega, Vanessa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Pedag, Avda El Bosque 1290, Santa Ines, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Cruz, Maribel; Perez, Ma.

Revising theories of social cognition on the basis of schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders,research in developmental disabilities,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social cognition; Schizophrenia; Autism; Phenomenology; Cognitive science; Psychopathology; Theory of mind,INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; 1ST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; DIRECT PERCEPTION; ADULTS; MIND; SIMULATION; BRAIN; DISSOCIALITY; EXPERIENCE,"Schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that mainly impair social competence, while general intelligence (IQ) is spared. Both disorders have a strong ancillary role in theoretical research on social cognition. Recently the debate has started to be inflected by embodied and phenomenological approaches, which claim that the standard portrayal of all social understanding as so-called 'mindreading', i.e. the attribution of mental states to others in the service of explaining and predicting their behavior, is misguided. Instead it is emphasized that we normally perceive others directly as conscious and goal-directed persons, without requiring any theorizing and/or simulation. This paper evaluates some of the implications of abnormal experiences reported by people with schizophrenia and ASD for the current debate in cognitive science. For these people the practice of explicit mindreading seems to be a compensatory strategy that ultimately fails to compensate for - and may even exacerbate - their impairment of intuitive and interactive social understanding. Phenomenological psychopathology thereby supports the emerging view that 'mindreading' is not the principal form of normal social understanding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to further investigate whether this procedure would improve face recognition memory in 5- and 7-year-old children (Experiment 1) and adults with Down syndrome (Experiment 2). In a delayed matching-to-sample task, participants had to select the previously shown face (sample stimulus) among six alternatives faces (comparison stimuli) in four different delays (1, 5, 10, or 15 s). Participants were tested in two conditions: differential, where each sample stimulus was paired with a specific outcome; and non-differential outcomes, where reinforcers were administered randomly. The results showed a significantly better face recognition in the differential outcomes condition relative to the non-differential in both experiments.

Socioeconomic indicators were assessed by a proxy-report questionnaire. Body mass index and physical fitness were assessed using a PROES-BR health-related fitness test battery.Results: Socioeconomic status is not associated with body mass index in adolescents with Down syndrome. In addition, two of five physical fitness variables were associated with groups of family income and paternal education level in boys, while one of five physical fitness variables were associated with groups of paternal and maternal education level in girls.Conclusion: Our results suggest that socioeconomic indicators are associated with some components of physical fitness in Brazilian adolescents with Down syndrome.

The study particularly centers on the analysis of interpersonal and ideational linguistic resources used by teachers and students that contribute to the inclusion of historical evidence in the discourse, in combination with the building of semantic waves (Maton, 2014, 2016) through the variation of semantic density and semantic gravity. The analysis shows that when teachers and students use a strong semantic gravity (SG+), they also have a tendency of employing a more heteroglossic-oriented discourse, whereas when teachers and students use a strong semantic density (SD+), their discourse tends to be oriented to more monoglossic choices in language (Martin & White, 2005). The language resources chosen by teachers and students in their pedagogical interactions impact how historical thinking is constructed in the classroom; particularly regarding the space, these more or less specialized and nonspecialized language resources provide for the incorporation of epistemic and axiological sources, which are necessary to build history as an interpretative social science through different levels of abstraction.

Dialogic model (kishu kimkelay ta che) participatory research method was used on two sample groups: one made up of teachers working in schools and another involving university teachers who train teachers-to-be. Results show an enormous gap between the concept of communication competence proposed by both groups; while one is rooted in bilingualism and biculturality linked to the territory in which they work, the other emphasizes formal and procedural aspects of the dominant language.","[Ferrada, Donatila] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social CIEJUS, Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile; [Del Pino, Miguel] Univ Catolica Temuco, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social CIEJUS, Temuco, Chile",,"Ferrada, D (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Educ Justicia Social CIEJUS, Ave San Miguel 3605, Talca, Chile.",dferrada@ucm.cl,"Del Pino, Miguel/Q-9046-2017; Ferrada, Donatila/S-3990-2016","Del Pino, Miguel/0000-0003-3379-3994; Ferrada, Donatila/0000-0003-0942-4320",Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [Proyecto Fondecyt] [1140363],This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONICYT)and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [Proyecto Fondecyt No 1140363].,,38,1,1,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-3152,1931-3160,,INT MULTILING RES J,Int.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis in 115 Spanish schoolchildren 4-to-7 years. Motor competence and HRQoL were assessed using the MACB-2 and the KINDL-R questionnaire, respectively. Results: ANCOVA model showed that children with DCD children obtained lower scores in physical well-being, friends, school and total HRQoL dimensions than TD peers after controlling for covariates (p < 0.05). Moreover, parents' perception scores in HRQoL were lower in children with DCD than in TD peers (79.7 vs 84.8; p = 0.022). Student T-tests for repeated-measures showed non-significant differences between children and parents' perceptions in mean HRQoL scores, by motor competence categories. The intraclass correlations coefficients between parents and children's perception of HRQoL was moderate in DCD category (0.62; p = 0.024) and small in TD category (0.29; p = 0.049). Conclusions: Children under 6 years old with DCD have lower HRQoL scores than their TD peers. No differences were found between children's and parents' perceptions in total HRQoL, although the perceptions of children and parents in DCD category showed a significantly higher level of agreement than TD children. Interventions aimed at promoting motor skills in school settings during the preschool age seem necessary to improve children's quality of life.","[Redondo-Tebar, Andres; Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel; Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente; Notario-Pacheco, Blanca; Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Social & Hlth Res Ctr, Cuenca, Spain; [Ruiz-Hermosa, Abel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, GENUD Toledo Reseach Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Martinez-Vizcaino, Vicente] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Talca, Chile; [Maria Martin-Espinosa, Noelia] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Enfermeria, Toledo, Spain; [Notario-Pacheco, Blanca] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Enfermeria, Cuenca, Spain; [Sanchez-Lopez, Mairena] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ, Ciudad Real, Spain",,"Martinez-Vizcaino, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ctr Estudios Sociosanitarios, C Santa Teresa Jornet S-N, Cuenca 16071, Ecuador.",Andres.Redondo@uclm.es; Abel.RuizHermosa@uclm.es; Vicente.Martinez@uclm.es; Noelia.Martin@uclm.es; Blanca.Notario@uclm.es; Mairena.Sanchez@uclm.es,"Redondo-TŽbar, AndrŽs/X-7827-2019; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/AAZ-9034-2021","Redondo-TŽbar, AndrŽs/0000-0001-5920-6159; VIZCAINO, VICENTE MARTINEZ/0000-0001-6121-7893; Martin Espinosa, Noelia Maria/0000-0002-1298-6976; Sanchez Lopez, Mairena/0000-0002-0217-0623",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Carlos III Health Institute [FIS PI12/00761]; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission [FIS PI12/00761]; Research Network on Preventative Activities and Health Promotion [RD12/0005/0009]; University of Castilla-La Mancha [2018-CPUCLM-7813],This study was funded by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Carlos III Health Institute and FEDER funds (FIS PI12/00761) and the Research Network on Preventative Activities and Health Promotion (RD12/0005/0009) .

One of its key components is the emergence of the Traditional Educator, an indigenous person with the linguistic and cultural competencies necessary for teaching an indigenous language in a school context. Hence, this research is directed towards examining the perceptions of Traditional Educators regarding the teaching of indigenous languages. The contents of relevant documents and interviews with Traditional Educators from three groups of indigenous peoples (Mapuche, Aymara and Lican Antay) who participated in the study were analyzed using a qualitative methodology. Using the Critical Language Policies approach, the results were organized into three categories: (a) perceptions of Traditional Educators regarding the Intercultural Bilingual Education Program, (b) the relationship of Traditional Educators with other participants in the school system, and (c) teaching strategies declared by Traditional Educators for teaching in the Indigenous Language Class (Sector Lengua Indigena). We concluded that the work of Traditional Educators within schools is isolated and lacks the support of local communities and the Intercultural Bilingual Education Program.","[Becerra-Lubies, Rukmini; Bolomey Cordova, Carlos; Meli Fernandez, Daniela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile",,"Becerra-Lubies, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile.",rubecerra@uc.cl,,,"Grant CONICYT FONDAP [15110006, CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746]",This work was supported by the Grant CONICYT FONDAP 15110006 and CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746.,,53,0,0,4,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction is based on the assumption that physical representations of speech sounds and spectrography allow learners to objectively see and modify those non-accurate features in their oral production which may impede effective communication in the target language. Twenty-six pre-service non-native English teachers, 16 in the experimental group and 10 in the control group, participated in the investigation. During a two-week period, the experimental group received Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction while the control group was exposed to a more traditional pronunciation approach. Production accuracy of the target segments was evaluated by two production tasks and a perceptual identification task. Acoustic measurements from the production tasks show that Acoustic Spectrographic Instruction significantly improved pronunciation of both vowels. Data from perceptual identification also indicate pronunciation improvement of both vowels, particularly for English / I /. Taken together, the results of these three experiments lend support to the use of acoustic features of speech and spectrography in English segmental acquisition.","Univ Arturo Prat, Fac Ciencias Humanas Educac & Humanidades, Iquique, Chile",,"Quintana-Lara, M (corresponding author), Univ Arturo Prat, Fac Ciencias Humanas Educac & Humanidades, Iquique, Chile.",marcela.quintana@unap.cl,,,,,,51,7,7,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-8221,1744-3210,,COMPUT ASSIST LANG L,Comput.

J,"Lizama, MV",,,,"Vidal Lizama, Margarita",,,A linguistic description of popular education: The enactment of pedagogy in the classroom,linguistics and education,,,English,Article,,,,,,Systemic Functional Linguistics; Pedagogy; Popular education; Knowledge; Interaction,,"The paper explores a practice of popular education in Chile, in order to provide a linguistically based description of its pedagogy based on two key pedagogic dimensions: knowledge and interaction. The study is informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics and explores ideational and interpersonal meanings realised in resources from the discourse-semantic stratum, which are understood to construe knowledge and enact social relations through language. Discursive analysis shows continuity and discontinuity in meaning patterns in classroom discourse. Prevalent ideational and interpersonal patterns show an orientation towards the construal of specialised knowledge and the enactment of hierarchical relations between participants. However, instances of discontinuity in discourse show that a more horizontal relation can be enacted when a different patterning of ideational and interpersonal meanings occurs. The paper argues that the pedagogy of popular education, deemed by the literature as 'democratic', becomes so by transmitting to its students knowledge that would be otherwise inaccessible while at the same time opening up the space for instances of more egalitarian interaction in the classroom.

This research uses a qualitative design that adopts discourse analysis to examine 57 essays by students between 12 and 17 years old. The essays addressed historical problems. With the help of experts in history and teaching history, nine essays were analyzed according to the categories of agency, construction of a causal chain, and perspective on the evidence. The results identified three ways that students build historical explanation: chronicle without a historical sense; narration without a historical sense; and narration with a historical sense. The authors conclude that in teaching and learning historical causation and the determination of historical problems, the relationship between the processes of reading and the analysis of evidence, as well as their organization and transfer into writing, must be considered.

This is due to their negative impact on youth development over time. LS refers to the evaluation people make of their lives and overall quality of life. Within the school context, there are several important dimensions to the development of LS among adolescents, such as peer relationships and also school climate. School satisfaction and school bonding are two dimensions of school climate which can affect the occurrence of bullying during the adolescence. Although there has been substantial research on children's LS, little research has been done in South America using longitudinal data to examine the importance of school variables that influence bullying and LS. Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine the long-term effect of school satisfaction, bonding, and bullying on adolescent LS one year after bullying victimization. Structural equation modeling was used on a sample of 555 Chilean adolescents with a mean age of 13.5 years old of which 42.9% are females. School satisfaction was negatively related to bullying perpetration, but not to bullying victimization. Conversely, school bonding was negatively associated with bullying victimization, but not with bullying perpetration. Lastly, bullying victimization was associated with lower levels of LS one year after the experience, even when controlling for age and gender. Bullying perpetration had no effect on LS. These results highlight the importance of school variables and peer relationships for adolescent LS development over time and reinforce the importance of preventative initiatives in schools.","[Varela, Jorge J.; Sanchez, Paulina A.; Gonzalez, Constanza; Valenzuelal, Pilar; Cabrera, Tamara] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Av Plaza 680, Santiago, Chile; [Oriol, Xavier] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Santiago, Chile",,"Varela, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Av Plaza 680, Santiago, Chile.",joyarela@udd.cl,"Granado, Xavier Oriol/AAO-3112-2021","Granado, Xavier Oriol/0000-0001-7130-7729; Sanchez, Paulina Alejandra/0000-0002-0357-8778; Gonzalez Matamala, Constanza/0000-0001-6748-9064","FONDECYT Iniciacion, CONICYT, ChileComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11170746]","FONDECYT Iniciacion No 11170746, CONICYT, Chile.",,118,4,4,8,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-2625,1866-2633,,SCH MENT HEALTH,School Ment.

The available explanations are insufficient because they do not account for the evidence showing that gains in content knowledge are unrelated to group outcomes and are still evident weeks after collaboration occurs. The aim of this article is to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between peer-group argumentation and science content knowledge learning. A total of 187 students (aged 10 to 11 years) from 8 classrooms participated in the study, with the classrooms spread across 8 public schools, all located in Santiago, Chile. We conducted a quasi-experimental study randomized at school-class level. Four teachers delivered science lessons following a teaching program especially developed to foster dialogic and argumentative classroom talk (the intervention group), and four teachers delivered lessons in their usual way (the control group). Students were assessed individually using both immediate and delayed post-test measures of science content knowledge. The results showed no differences in pre- to post-immediate content knowledge between conditions. However, the intervention-group students increased their content knowledge significantly more than the control-group students between post-immediate and post-delayed tests. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that, after controlling for school-level variables, time working in groups, and scores in the pretest, the formulation of counter arguments, although occurring in both groups, significantly predicted delayed gains in the intervention group only. Moreover, the frequency of counterarguments heard by students during the group work did not make a difference. Focal analysis of one small-group work suggests that teachers' instructional practice may have contributed to the consolidation of students' knowledge at an individual level in a post-collaborative phase.","[Larrain, Antonia; Freire, Paulina; Lopez, Patricia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile; [Grau, Valeska] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Larrain, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Psychol, Chile Almirante Barroso 10, Santiago, Chile.",alarrain@uahurtado.cl,"Larrain, Antonia/J-6827-2017","Larrain, Antonia/0000-0002-1968-4516; Freire, Paulina/0000-0002-7590-2231","Fondo de Desarrollo Cientiifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT) [1140995, 1170431]","This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientiifico y Tecnologico de Chile (FONDECYT), under Grants [1140995 and 1170431].",,112,11,11,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0737-0008,1532-690X,,COGNITION INSTRUCT,Cogn.

In this paper, we describe these adaptions using a framework that focuses on four different elements of the context: Objectives, Stakeholders, Key moment and Interactions.

This is why educating implies asymmetry and hierarchy, that is, pedagogical authority. However, today's societies are decreasingly hierarchical, and subjects are more critical of authority. In a sociocultural context in which the classical forms of authority are weakening, young education students have to construct new meanings which they find coherent and effective. With the goal of exploring the new understandings of pedagogical authority, a study was conducted of 913 education students in different Spanish-speaking countries: Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Spain. The multinational analysis enabled us to identify cross-cutting meanings, as well as local understandings constructed by the education students in today's society. A questionnaire with both closed and open-ended questions was administered. The overall results indicate that viewing authority grounded in reciprocal respect between teachers and students cuts across the participants and is significantly associated with the teaching of academic knowledge.","[Zamora-Poblete, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Gil-Madrona, Pedro] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Mendez-Hinojosa, Luz-Marina] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Galvis-Leal, Pedro] Univ Libre Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Tadeo-Morales, Jose] Univ Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela",,"Zamora-Poblete, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Teoria & Polit Educ, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile.",gzamora@puc.cl,"Leal, Pedro Galvis/AAR-6756-2021; Gil-Madrona, Pedro/H-5066-2015; Zamora, Guillermo/B-2067-2017","Leal, Pedro Galvis/0000-0003-1217-3964; Gil-Madrona, Pedro/0000-0002-1503-6394; Zamora, Guillermo/0000-0002-9530-9144",,,,23,0,0,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1135-6405,1578-4118,,CULT EDUC-UK,Cult.

Lack of knowledge about their rights and tools for effective self-advocacy seem to be key elements that need to be improved to facilitate participation. Method We present PaisDI, a 16 h long manualised program created by self-advocates in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team, with four modules: rights and intellectual disability, leadership in intellectual disability, effective communication and financial considerations of social projects. This quasi-experimental study had 349 participants, divided in three groups: people with intellectual disability, relatives and professionals. Feasibility and effectiveness where measured. Results The program is shown to be viable and effective, especially in its impact on self-perception for self-advocacy activities.

This article analyzes the research culture of Latin American professors in 20 countries in the digital era, and their relationship with the production of scientific papers indexed in the Journal Citation Report (JCR) between 1996 and 2019. A questionnaire (with validity and reliability criteria) with a Likert-type scale was applied to 2,215 professors selected from five international scientific events. The main results show that 78% of the professors have less than 15 years of teaching experience, with ages under 44 years of age and 38.9% of them with an undergraduate academic level, 62.5% of whom responded that they have never published in indexed journals, and that they do not know the proper application of paradigms and research designs. On the other hand, 23.86% of the total citations are self-citations. Therefore, the results reflect a significant relationship between the research culture of professors and Latin American scientific production. Finally, Latin American professors have found themselves in economic, political and social circumstances that affect good research and scientific publication practices, leaving a training gap in research competencies in the new digital era.","[Gonzalez-Diaz, Romel] Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia; [Acevedo-Duque, Angel] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Observ Polit Publ, Providencia, Chile; [Martin-Fiorino, Victor] Univ El Bosque, Fac Ingn, Bogota, Colombia; [Cachicatari-Vargas, Elena] Univ Nacl Jorge Basadre Grehmann, Fac Ciencias Salud, Tacna, Peru",,"Gonzalez-Diaz, R (corresponding author), Ctr Int Invest & Desarrollo CIID, Monteria, Colombia.",director@ciid.com.co; angel.acevedo@uautonoma.cl; vrmartin@ucatolica.edu.co; ecachicatariv@unjbg.edu.pe,"; Acevedo-Duque, Angel/G-5384-2015","Cachicatari Vargas, Elena/0000-0002-9843-432X; Acevedo-Duque, Angel/0000-0002-8774-3282",,,,48,0,0,4,4,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2022,30,70,,,,,69,83,,10.3916/C70-2022-06,,,13,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,XF7DJ,WOS:000724228000006,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

We use partial frontier approaches to mitigate the influence of outliers and the curse of dimensionality. Our estimation considers idiosyncratic variables at the school, class, and student levels. Our model is applied to a sample of students in fourth year of primary school in urban schools in Chile. Results are in line with previous findings that less than 30% of the variance in students' educational attainment is attributable to their schools. Results also corroborate that a model considering only student-level variables yields high inefficiencies not attributable to school management, but rather to inadequate resource-endowment policy. Therefore, when disregarding specific variables concerning the resources allocated to the schools, the performance of those schools is undervalued, largely because inefficiencies caused by suboptimal resource endowments or difficulties arising from the socioeconomic environment are instead attributed to poor school management.

Our test is based on employer learning-statistical discrimination models, which suggest that if employers use university reputation to predict a worker's unobservable quality, then college prestige should become less important for earnings as a worker gains labor market experience. In this framework, we use a regression discontinuity design to estimate a 13% wage premium for college graduates in their first year of the labor market who were barely accepted by one of the two most prestigious universities in Chile compared with those barely rejected by these two schools. However, we find that this premium decreases to 4% for workers with 6 or more years of labor market experience. This result suggests that college prestige becomes less important for employers as workers reveal their quality throughout their careers.","[Bordon, Paola] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Bordon, Paola] COES, Santiago, Chile; [Bordon, Paola] DESOC, Santiago, Chile; [Braga, Breno] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Braga, Breno] IZA, Bonn, Germany",,"Braga, B (corresponding author), Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.; Braga, B (corresponding author), IZA, Bonn, Germany.",bbraga@urban.org,,,Millennium Nucleus in Social Development DESOC;  [ANID/FONDECYT/3160658];  [ANID/FONDAP/15130009],"We would like to thank John Bound, Charlie Brown, Sebastian Calonico, Nicolas Grau, Brad Hershbein, John Kennan, David Lam, Fabian Lange, Brian McCall, Jeff Smith, Christopher Taber, and participants at EconCon, IAAE Conference, IWAEE Conference, LACEA, SOLE-EALE World Conference, Southern Economic Association, University of Chile, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, the Urban Institute, and SAIS Johns Hopkins University seminars for their valuable comments.

Therefore, this study delves into the relationship between the socialization that occurs in the network, digital skills and political participation online and offline. A quantitative survey-based methodology was used with university students from three Ibero-American countries: Mexico, Spain and Chile. The fieldwork was conducted between the months of December 2017 and June 2018. The results obtained show that young people consume mainly digital media, which does not prevent them from being critical with the quality they deserve. In this sense, the political participation actions in which they are involved are mostly developed in the network, thus participating to a lesser extent offline. Therefore, young people enter the world of politics through the consumption of information on the Internet, which favors a subsequent online political participation.","[De-la-Garza-Montemayor, Daniel-Javier] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Pena-Ramos, Jose-Antonio] Univ Autonoma Chile, Providencia, Chile; [Recuero-Lopez, Fatima] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Polit & Sociol, Granada, Spain",,"De-la-Garza-Montemayor, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Polit & Relac Int, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",danieldelagarza@gmail.com; japramos@ugr.es; frecuero@ugr.es,"RECUERO-LOPEZ, FATIMA/ABH-3223-2020; Pe–a-Ramos, JosŽ Antonio/AAM-8300-2020","RECUERO-LOPEZ, FATIMA/0000-0001-7531-6817; Pe–a-Ramos, JosŽ Antonio/0000-0001-7073-9562; de la Garza Montemayor, Daniel Javier/0000-0001-6962-9059",,,,38,5,5,2,5,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT 1,2019,27,61,,,,,83,92,,10.3916/C61-2019-07,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,JZ0BA,WOS:000504768000007,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

Using students who had an alternative source of funding as a control group, and administrative records before and after the reform, we present evidence that students are affected in different ways. First, we show that parents of students who ex ante were more likely to be credit restricted are more likely after the reform to report that their child ends up completing college. Second, we find that students in the same groups that increase their college expectations, obtain a score in high-stakes examination that actually qualified them for college aid.

Three ethnographic case studies were carried out, using individual interviews, focus groups, participant observations and document analysis in six schools. The main goal was to deeply understand how bottom up school initiatives, with a comprehensive use of digital technologies, are contributing to generate connected practices and to involve teachers, learners and communities in the discussion about what kind of society they want in their future, The results of the analysis indicate that fostering a transformative agency in secondary schools has the potential of engaging students in the exploration of contemporary social issues and that digital connectedness can contribute to connect schools with youth life trajectories and communities. This study on transformative agency and digital connectedness reveals a new path for educational transformation that may interest everybody who, in one way or another, are involved in education systems all around the world.","[Erstad, Ola] Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway; [Mino, Raquel; Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Barcelona, Dept Didact & Org Educ, Barcelona, Spain; [Rivera-Vargas, Pablo] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Educ & Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile",,"Erstad, O (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway.",ola.erstad@iped.uio.no; rmino@ub.edu; pablorivera@ub.edu,"Vargas, Pablo Rivera/AAL-9231-2021","Vargas, Pablo Rivera/0000-0002-9564-2596; Erstad, Ola/0000-0003-1712-300X; MORA RODRIGUEZ, ALBERTO/0000-0003-2247-6846; Mino Puigcercos, Raquel/0000-0002-5391-4637",,,,37,7,8,0,4,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,JAN,2021,29,66,,,,,9,20,,10.3916/C66-2021-01,,,12,Communication; Education & Educational Research,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Education & Educational Research,PN6AM,WOS:000604559500001,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-06,Otro,comunicar,Q1

Studies assessing executive functions (EF) and social cognition in both groups have found preserved and impaired performances. These inconsistent findings would be partially explained by the cognitive variability reported in these disorders. First, the present study explored the inter-individual variability in EF and social cognition in both patient groups. Second, we compared differential characteristics and commonalities in the cognitive profiles of EF and social cognition between ADHD, AS and control adults. We assessed 22 patients with ADHD, 23 adults with AS and 21 matched typically developing subjects using different measures of EF (working memory, cognitive flexibility and multitasking) and social cognition (theory of mind and decision-making). Group comparisons and multiple case series analyses (MCSA) were conducted. The between-group comparisons showed an EF deficit in working memory in ADHD and a theory of mind (ToM) impairment in AS. The MCSA evidenced that, compared to controls, ADHD patients had a higher inter-individual variability in EF, while individuals with AS had a more heterogeneous profile in social cognition tasks compared to both groups. Finally, the AS and ADHD groups presented higher task-related variability compared to controls and shared a common heterogeneous profile in EF. This is the first study to compare variability in EF and social cognition profiles of ADHD and AS. We propose that heterogeneity in EF performance is a link between ADHD and AS which may explain the overlap of symptomatology between both diagnoses. In addition, patients with AS seem to show a unique heterogeneous profile in ToM which may explain the low probability of finding AS symptoms in patients with ADHD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students' feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive. When compared to other courses they have taken so far, students evaluate this experience as superior.","[Werneck Barbosa, Marcelo] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Pedro Valdivia 425, Santiago, Chile; [Rodrigues, Cesar de Avila] Globo Comunicacao & Participacoes, Ave Amer 700 Bloco 2 1, BR-22640100 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,"Barbosa, MW (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Adm & Negocios, Pedro Valdivia 425, Santiago, Chile.",marcelo.werneck@uautonoma.cl; cesar.rodrigues@corp.globo.com,"Werneck, Marcelo/AAJ-5702-2020","Werneck, Marcelo/0000-0003-3993-5375",,,,52,9,9,10,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1472-8117,2352-3565,,INT J MANAG EDUC-OXF,Int.

We assessed the effectiveness of biodiversity education workshops in influencing knowledge, beliefs, personal norms and conservation behaviors among Chilean winegrowers. We used a switching replication design with pre, post and follow-up tests to measure the impact of two workshop formats on 164 participants at four wineries. Environmental knowledge increased after workshops and persisted over time. Perceived ability to reduce threats to biodiversity also increased, but only significantly at one winery. No differences were found between the conventional workshop, more focused on technology transfer, and the participatory format. The limited effect of the workshops on variables influencing behavior change suggests modifications are needed. The value-belief-norm theory provided insights on how to improve these conservation education workshops, such as developing messages targeting specific consequences of environmental problems.","[Marquez-Garcia, Marcela; Jacobson, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Marquez-Garcia, Marcela; Barbosa, Olga] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Las Palmeras 3425, Santiago 7800024, Chile; [Barbosa, Olga] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Valdivia, Chile",,"Marquez-Garcia, M (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Las Palmeras 3425, Santiago 7800024, Chile.",marcela.marquez@gmail.com,"Barbosa, Olga/D-5437-2015","Barbosa, Olga/0000-0001-9397-0070; Jacobson, Susan/0000-0001-5992-939X",Rufford Foundation; Idea Wild; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research [CONICYT PIA APOYO CCTE AFB170008]; CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Tropical Conservation and Development Program; School of Natural Resources and Environment; Graduate School at the University of Florida,"The Rufford Foundation and Idea Wild gave financial support, along with funding provided to O.B. from the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT PIA APOYO CCTE AFB170008).

Drawing on research across four schools, this article examines how the dynamics between state-led top-down prescriptive guidelines interface with teacher practice, school objectives, and existing racializing dynamics to produce diverse educational outcomes. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research involving over 100 pupils and teachers, this article identifies two key in-school processes that work to undercut official policy effectiveness. First, state policies do little to challenge staff and institutionalized racism, thereby perpetuating the marking of Indigenous pupils as Other. Combined with lack of political will and resources for teacher training and lesson preparation, this leaves educational inequalities in place. Second, the institutional allocation of time and resources to intercultural education reinforces widespread devaluation of indigenous knowledge among teachers, educators and public opinion. Nevertheless, the study also found that in certain schools these conditions did not prevent the adoption of pedagogies that affirmed Indigenous difference and challenged the dominance of whiteness. Informed by a critical theorization of the power and unmarked nature of racial inequality, this article argues that whiteness is neither recognized nor challenged in rural secondary schools in southern Chile, despite its ubiquity and pervasive influence on curriculum, pedagogies and institutional arrangements.","[Webb, Andrew] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Macul, Chile; [Radcliffe, Sarah] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England",,"Webb, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Sociol, Macul, Chile.",Andrew.webb@uc.cl,,"Webb, Andrew/0000-0003-2706-7670",,,,41,5,5,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1361-3324,1470-109X,,RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK,Race Ethn.

Its early inception in 1813 resulted from the necessity of consolidating a republican order, as shown by the different projects between 1810 and 1813. During its first years, a revolutionary rhetoric emphasising discontinuities with the colonial past prevailed. Yet, after the consolidation of independence, institutional and intellectual links to the inherited Catholic tradition heavily affected the definite shape of the Instituto. In this context, the negotiations with the Catholic church and the role played by the moderate Juan Egana explain the fact that the model of republic related to the Instituto in its first decades focused on virtue and morality.","Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Liberal Arts, Santiago, Chile",,"Ruz, AB (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Liberal Arts, Santiago, Chile.",afbaeza@gmail.com,,"Baeza, Andres/0000-0001-7532-848X",,,,23,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0030-9230,,,PAEDAGOG HIST,Paedagog.

Regarding the second layer, we discuss the value of dialogue and the possibilities it offers to develop ideas for science education in a way that might be democratising, emancipatory, and offering counter-narratives in a neoliberal Chile. By engaging in this dialogue revisiting the practices of our communities, we gained a sense of agency within the field of science education. However, we realised that we need to move towards a critical view within our communities, and more contextual and transformative science education by translating these sites of hope to our educational praxis today. For us, this relates both to developing a collective view of how to make science education provide pedagogical conditions and experiences for critical and engaged citizenship and thinking how we can act and engage with different settings in solidarity. One way of moving towards this is by developing a political knowledge of our disciplines through a collective scientific conscientisation. Our communities are the departure points to achieve this.","[Torres-Olave, Betzabe] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Gonzalez, Paulina Bravo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Torres-Olave, B (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",b.torresolave@bristol.ac.uk,,"Torres-Olave, Betzabe/0000-0003-3599-1310","Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID)/Scholarship Programme/Doctorado Becas Chile [2017 -72180111, 2015 -72160217]","This work was funded by the Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID)/Scholarship Programme/Doctorado Becas Chile/2017 -72180111, and Doctorado Becas Chile/2015 -72160217.",,79,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1871-1502,1871-1510,,CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT,Cult.

It is necessary to detail the precise actions that the teacher must perform in order to apply the proposed strategies for the integration of digital and non-digital resources. It is not about teacher training; it is about giving teachers the tools to structure their classes and empower them beyond the training process. Every aspect of the class should be specified, leaving what finally will be performed to the teacher. We conclude that an adequate orchestration helps to guide the teacher through the work to be performed in the classroom, allowing a shift from an instructor-centered arrangement, in which the teacher radiates knowledge before a passive class of students, to one where the students actively participate, with the teacher acting as a mediator.

It does so by comparing the effect of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) on the digital skills of Chilean students compared with mathematics and language. This comparison is made using national standardized tests. The marginal effect of a group of variables measuring student ESCS was compared both as a whole and separately using multivariate linear regression analysis. The results show that the marginal effect of ESCS as a whole on students digital skills was equal to the effect on mathematics and greater than the effect on language. Furthermore, the results show that the parents' level of education was the most relevant factor of ESCS for explaining student performance on the digital test, more so than for mathematics and language. These findings challenge the belief that the Internet would reduce economic, social and cultural inequalities in new generations. Instead, they reveal that the gap among Chilean students tends to perpetuate or widen when comparing performance in mathematics and language with performance in the digital domain. At the same time, by comparing national test results, this paper offers empirical evidence for the existence of a second digital divide in the field of education, a concept which is widely discussed at a theoretical level but with little empirical support to date.

In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed that assists in the design and classroom integration of educational games. The framework addresses both the educational dimension and the ludic dimension. The educational dimension employs Bloom's revised taxonomy to define learning objectives and applies the classroom multiplayer presential game (CMPG) pedagogical model while the ludic dimension determines the gaming elements subject to constraints imposed by the educational dimension. With a view to validating the framework, a game for teaching electrostatics was designed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An evaluation based on pre/post testing found that the game increased the average number of correct answers by students participating in the experiment from 6.11 to 10.00, a result found to be statistically significant. Thus validated, the framework offers a promising basis for further exploration through the development of other games and fine-tuning of its components. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These effects were studied using a sample of 1274 students from economically disadvantaged schools in Chile. The videogames were specifically designed to address the educational goals of the first and second years of school, for basic mathematics and reading comprehension. The sample was divided into experimental groups (EG), internal control groups (IC) and external control groups (EC). Students in the EG groups, used the experimental video games during an average of 30 h over a 3-month period. They were evaluated on their acquisition of reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematical skills, and on their motivation to use video games. Teachers' expectations of change due to the use of video games, their technological transfer, and handling of classroom dynamics, were assessed through ad hoc tests and classroom observations. The results show significant differences between the EG and IC groups in relation to the EC group in Math, Reading Comprehension and Spelling, but no significant differences in these aspects were found between the EG and the IC groups. Teacher reports and classroom observations confirm an improvement in motivation to learn, and a positive technological transfer of the experimental tool. Although further studies regarding the effects of learning through videogame use are imperative, positive effects on motivation and classroom dynamics, indicate that the introduction of educational video games can be a useful tool in promoting learning within the classroom.

New learning objects are usually assessed when students actually use the materials. To improve quality assurance in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not only considering student feedback, but also integrating other perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3 teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall quality of the learning objects.","[Madariaga, Leonardo] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Engn Design Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 3939, Santiago, Chile; [Nussbaum, Miguel; Gutierrez, Ivan; Barahona, Camila] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Meneses, Alejandra] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile",,"Madariaga, L (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Engn Design Dept, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 3939, Santiago, Chile.",leonardo.madariaga@usm.cl,"Madariaga, Leonardo/M-2447-2017; Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Madariaga, Leonardo/0000-0001-9338-5840; Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983",ANID/FONDECYT [1180024],The research results informed in this report were supported by ANID/FONDECYT 1180024.,,75,1,1,11,48,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

On the other hand, based on Yuriko Saito's account of Japanese garden design, we offer an alternative understanding of time that incorporates interruption, delay and 'unwrapping' as means to an enriched experience. The article concludes by identifying new questions and pedagogical orientations that contribute to reconsidering how schools teach to perceive, conceive and live time.","[Marini, Guillermo; Rodriguez Merchan, Juan David] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Teoria & Polit Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Marini, G (corresponding author), Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",gmarini@uc.cl,,"Marini, Guillermo/0000-0001-9957-5151",,,,30,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

The approach uses a multiple classification matrix and our application was built for language-learning (in this case Spanish). The basic collaboration mechanism that the approach is based upon is silent collaboration, in which students-through suggestions and exchanges-must compare their ideas to those of their classmates. An exploratory experimental study was performed along with a quantitative and qualitative study that analyzed ease of use of the software, described how the conditions for collaborative learning were achieved, evaluated the achievements in learning under the defined language objectives, and analyzed the impact of silent and spoken collaboration.

Contrary to what many people think, Lavoisier concluded that any change in volume in this experiment is negligible; moreover, the explanation relating oxygen consumption in the air with its change in volume is known to be wrong. In this work we briefly review the history behind the candle experiment and its relationship with some typical erroneous explanations. One of the key factors behind Lavoisier's success was the use of experiments carefully designed to test different hypotheses. Following these steps, we performed several closed volume experiments where the candle wick was replaced by a capillary stainless steel cylinder supported and heated by a nichrome filament connected to an external power supply. Our recorded experiments are displayed as web pages, designed with the purpose that the reader can easily visualize and analyze modern versions of Lavoisier's experiments. These experiments clearly show an initial phase of complete combustion, followed by a phase of incomplete combustion with elemental carbon or soot rising to the top of the vessel, and a final phase where the hot artificial wick only evaporates a white steam of wax that cannot ignite because no oxygen is left in the closed atmosphere. After either a complete or incomplete combustion of the oxygen, our experiments show that the final gas volume is nearly equal to the initial air volume.","[Vera, Francisco; Rivera, Rodrigo; Nunez, Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Rivera, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Av Univ 330 Curauma, Valparaiso, Chile.",rodrigo.rivera@ucv.cl,"; Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/M-4058-2017","Vera, Francisco/0000-0002-6272-7390; Nunez Ramirez, Cesar/0000-0001-8506-2494",Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [TE10I012]; Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110713]; Direccion General de Investigacion y Posgrado de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"We would like to acknowledge financial support from Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF Project TE10I012), Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT Project 1110713) and from Direccion General de Investigacion y Posgrado de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

Most search engines base their algorithms on a resource's text or popularity, requiring teachers to navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource. This makes searching for resources a tedious and cumbersome task. Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aim to facilitate the discovery of quality resources. Nevertheless, the abundance and variety of content make searching a complex task. Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content by determining clusters of similar users and inferring users' interest in a resource, assembling clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both. Probabilistic model-based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make it possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with various degrees of probability. In this paper, we used recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers over the course of four years and under natural conditions. We found that a hybrid recommendation, the Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset. In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommender's accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results.","[Peralta, Montserrat; Alarcon, Rosa; Pichara, Karim E.; Mery, Tomas; Cano, Felipe] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Bozo, Jorge] Univ Catlica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Coquimbo 1780000, Chile",,"Alarcon, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",mperalt1@uc.cl; rosa.alarcon@gmail.com; kpb@ing.puc.cl; tmery1@ing.puc.cl; ralarcon@ing.puc.cl; jorge.bozo@ucn.cl,,"Bozo, Jorge/0000-0003-4073-5039",UC-Fundacion Chile ERAR: Evaluating Digital Learning Resources for Potential Recommendation project,The authors would like to thank Fundacion Chile - Educar Chile for making available the learning resources repository for this research.

However, there is no clear consensus on how to evaluate these new technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for estimating the value of a new educational technology in three steps: benefit analysis, through the administration of a well-designed experiment; cost analysis, which incorporates costs to weigh against the benefits; and feasibility analysis, which introduces real-world concerns that may affect the ability to actually implement the technology. To illustrate the methodology, a case study from Chile is used where portable educational video games were introduced into first and second grade classrooms with the aim of improving learning in mathematics and language. This paper demonstrates the importance of all three steps in the evaluation process and provides a framework for future analyses. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of the interventions in promoting abstinent behavior reported in 12 controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the analysis indicated a very small overall effect of the interventions in abstinent behavior. Moderator analysis could only be pursued partially because of limited information in primary research studies. Parental participation in the program, age of the participants, virgin-status of the sample, grade level, percentage of females, scope of the implementation and year of publication of the study were associated with variations in effect sizes for abstinent behavior in univariate tests. However, only parental participation and percentage of females were significant in the weighted least-squares regression analysis. The richness of a meta-analytic approach appears limited by the quality of the primary research. Unfortunately, most of the research does not employ designs to provide conclusive evidence of program effects.

Therefore, this study set out to analyze the psychometric properties of a questionnaire to measure the stimuli and cognitive reactions inherent in Immersive Technology. Rigorous criteria were considered in the questionnaire's design and validation in order to achieve this objective: theoretical review, expert judgment, cognitive interview, pilot test, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The instrument was administered to 231 middle school students in Concepcion, Chile. Participants responded to the instrument after observing and interacting with science content using augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. After conducting the analyses, a latent structure with a good fit for the data was obtained, consisting of 16 items that underlie the latent variables, interactivity, presence, and flow. The questionnaire, called TINMER, presents a satisfactory level of reliability (0.85).

However, most of the research has been done with children beyond the ages of early childhood. This could be due to the common and erroneous belief that young children have not developed the capacity to work collaboratively toward a given aim. In this paper we show how small group co-located collaborative learning on a single display computer improves oral language, logical-mathematical and social skills in pre-school children. Considering that early childhood teachers have a responsibility to provide a supportive environment, teacher mediation is essential in order to achieve collaborative learning. Thus, teachers were trained in the use of the technology and strategies for effective collaborative learning. The study was implemented in 10 kindergarten classrooms with 268 children between the ages of 5 and 6 years old. A group of 5 kindergarten classrooms with equivalent characteristics participated as a comparison group. During the four-month intervention, children worked on collaborative activities at least twice a week. A quasi-experimental approach was used to assess the implementation, including pre- and post-testing. The data showed differences in the learning of oral language, logical-mathematical and social skills, with the experimental group demonstrating significantly greater achievement.","[Nussbaum, Miguel; Weitz, Juan F.; Lopez, Ximena; Mena, Javiera; Torres, Alex] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 4860, Chile; [Gomez, Florencia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago 4860, Chile",,"Gomez, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Educ, Santiago 4860, Chile.",fgomezz@uc.cl; mn@ing.puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Torres, Alex/0000-0003-4501-9453; Gomez Zaccarelli, Florencia/0000-0003-0916-0062",,,,56,10,10,2,49,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1556-1607,1556-1615,,INT J COMP-SUPP COLL,Int.

For a week, Smartphone devices which beeped seven times a day were given to School Principals and Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units, who then answered closed questions about their current agenda. Six municipal schools in a district of the V Region of Chile participated in the study. The main results support the notion that, at the time of data collection, most school Principals and Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units were working alone, and if they were interacting with other people, they were always in command. Following underlying assumed roles, most school principals reported performing administrative tasks, while Heads of Technical-Pedagogical Units mainly addressed instructional issues, fostering a rigid framework for the assignment of tasks. Follow-up semi-structured interviews confirmed that participants were not working as a team but rather alone on important issues and urgent matters. Participants regarded the use of the device as a very practical and useful tool to analyze their daily practices. Results are discussed focusing on the use of portable technology to address methodological issues faced when approaching research on educational leadership from a distributed leadership perspective.

J,"Bellolio, C",,,,"Bellolio, Cristobal",,,Disaggregating the Creationist Challenge to Liberal Neutrality,journal of philosophy of education,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCIENCE; RELIGION,"In the US and elsewhere, creationist groups have challenged the mandatory science curriculum because it introduces the theory of evolution as the true story of biodiversity. This paper disaggregates this challenge in two distinctive levels. On the substantive level, creationists claim that Darwinian evolution is not value-neutral, as most scientists portray it, but it works as a philosophically-loaded theory that amounts to naturalism, which is a comprehensive doctrine that undermines traditional theism. Creationists then contend that its exclusive teaching violates the liberal promise of religious neutrality. To restore metaphysical fairness, they propose to include non-naturalistic theories into the official curriculum as a way of balance. On the epistemic level, creationists criticise liberal institutions-from courts of justice to educational boards and executive officials-that demarcate science in a way in which supernatural hypotheses can never compete for the best factual explanation. Under the guise of a purely methodological naturalism, they argue, liberals are opting for a cognitive filter that is biased against the belief that God intervenes in cosmic history. To restore epistemological fairness, they propose that theories that suggest supernatural agency should be rehabilitated and eventually included in the science curriculum. In these two distinct levels, the creationist claim is advanced as a logical implication of political liberalism's purported commitment to religious impartiality.","[Bellolio, Cristobal] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Hernando de Aguirre 1738, Santiago, Chile",,"Bellolio, C (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Hernando de Aguirre 1738, Santiago, Chile.",cristobal.bellolio@uai.cl,"Bellolio, Crist—bal/M-3111-2019","Bellolio, Crist—bal/0000-0002-7547-7773",,,,69,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

To support such activities, the Kelluwen platform provides a complementary micro-blogging tool called Worklog. In this study, we analyze data collected from Worklog messages generated by 101 cohorts of students from different schools and different levels, who participated in Kelluwen activities. We first used machine learning techniques to discover three types of messages which coincide with three dialogic functions; referential, phatic, and emotional. We then analyze how different factors of the cohort and group setup relate to the presence of different dialogic functions in Worklog. Results show the positive effect of pairing groups of students from different schools, and the positive influence of teacher participation.

However, there is no clear methodology for guiding the design of these types of games. To remedy this, we propose a structured methodology for the design of conceptual physics games that explicitly integrates the principles of the intrinsic integration approach for designing instructional games (Habgood & Ainsworth, 2011) with an atomic analysis of the structure of games (Cook, 2007; Cousins, 2005; Koster, 2005). To test this approach, we redesigned an existing game to teach electrostatics and compared the educational effectiveness of the original and redesigned versions. Our studies also compared an endogenous fantasy version of the game with a non-fantasy version. Our results showed that students who played the game which had been redesigned using the Atomic Intrinsic Integration Approach achieved a statistically significant improvement in results and showed fewer conceptual problems than the students who played the original version. The fantasy and non-fantasy versions, however, did not display any significant differences in outcomes. Based on the analysis and redesign of the game, we defined one possible methodology to assist in the design of games for the conceptual understanding of physics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing and interpreting graphs play a key role in the understanding of science, while the lack of these has proved to be a handicap and a limiting factor in the learning of scientific concepts. It has been observed that despite the amount of previous graph-working experience, students of all ages experience a series of difficulties when trying to comprehend graphs or when trying to relate them with physical concepts such as position, velocity and acceleration. Several computational tools have risen to improve the students' understanding of kinematical graphs; however, these approaches fail to develop graph construction skills. On the other hand, Robots have opened new opportunities in learning. Nevertheless, most of their educational applications focus on Robotics related subjects, such as robot programming, robot construction, and artificial intelligence. This paper describes a robotic activity based on face-to-face computer supported collaborative learning. By means of a set of handhelds and a robot wirelessly interconnected, the aim of the activity is to develop graph construction and graph interpretation skills while also reinforcing kinematics concepts. Results show that students using the robotic activity achieve a significant increase in their graph interpreting skills. Moreover, when compared with a similar computer-simulated activity, it proved to be almost twice as effective. Finally, the robotic application proved to be a highly motivating activity for the students, fostering collaboration among them. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample was composed of 528 seventh to ninth graders (Mage = 15; 64.1% girls) from 12 classrooms (four in each category of ability grouping) across two waves in five schools in Chile. The effects of academic performance and school misconduct on receiving academic and friendship nominations were examined, as well as the interplay between academic and friendship relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which similarity in adolescents' academic performance and school misconduct contributed to the formation and maintenance of academic and friendship relationships was examined. Sex, socioeconomic status, and structural network features were also taken into account. Longitudinal social network analyses (RSiena) indicated that (1) in high-ability classrooms students chose high-achieving peers as academic partners; (2) in high-ability classrooms students avoided deviant peers (i.e., those high in school misconduct) as academic partners; and (3) academic relationships led to friendships, and vice versa, in both high- and low-ability classrooms. Whereas the interplay of friendship and academic relationships was similar in high- and low-ability classrooms, the formation and maintenance of academic networks unfolded differently in these two types of classrooms.","[Palacios, Diego; Dijkstra, Jan Kornelis; Huisman, Mark; Veenstra, Rene] Univ Groningen, Dept Sociol, Grote Rozenstr 31, NL-9712 TG Groningen, Netherlands; [Villalobos, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Polit & Pract Educ CEPPE UC, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Trevino, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Berger, Christian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Psicol, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile",,"Palacios, D (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Sociol, Grote Rozenstr 31, NL-9712 TG Groningen, Netherlands.",d.f.palacios@rug.nl; jan.dijkstra@rug.nl; clvillal@uc.cl; ernesto.trevino@uc.cl; cberger@uc.cl; j.m.e.huisman@rug.nl; d.r.veenstra@rug.nl,"Villalobos, Cristobal/AAK-9559-2020; Palacios, Diego/F-2243-2015; Veenstra, RenŽ/G-6696-2011; Trevino, Ernesto/F-5723-2015","Villalobos, Cristobal/0000-0002-1964-7213; Palacios, Diego/0000-0001-6840-0068; Veenstra, RenŽ/0000-0001-6686-6307; Trevino, Ernesto/0000-0001-6510-1302; Huisman, Mark/0000-0002-9009-7859",CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2016 [7217010]; CONICYT PIA CIE [160007]; CONICYT-FONDAPComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP [15130009]; FONDECYT RegularComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1180667],The research was supported by the projects CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2016 [7217010]; CONICYT PIA CIE [160007]; CONICYT-FONDAP [15130009]; and FONDECYT Regular [1180667].,,91,7,9,8,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0022-4405,1873-3506,,J SCHOOL PSYCHOL,J.

One primary criticism focuses on the artificiality of the results derived from its internal structure because of the ipsative nature of the forced-choice format. This study seeks to contribute to the resolution of this debate. A short version of Kolb's LSI with a forced-choice format and an additional inventory scored on a Likert scale was completed by a sample of students of the University Catolica del Norte in Antofagasta, Chile. The data obtained from the two forms of the reduced version of the LSI were compared using principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and the Thurstonian Item Response Theory model. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of four learning mode dimensions. However, they do not support the existence of the learning styles as proposed by Kolb, indicating that said reports are the product of the artificial structure generated by the ipsative forced-choice format.","[Calderon Carvajal, Carlos; Lay-Lisboa, Siu; Briceno, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Norte, Sch Psychol, Antofagasta, Chile; [Ximenez Gomez, Carmen] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain",,"Carvajal, CC (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Psychol, Ave Angamos 0610, Antofagasta 1240000, Chile.",ccalderon@ucn.cl,"Calder—n, Carlos/AAT-4733-2021; Ximenez, Carmen/Q-6819-2018","Calder—n, Carlos/0000-0002-9237-3749; Ximenez, Carmen/0000-0003-1337-6309","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico of Chile, FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150182]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was financially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico of Chile, FONDECYT 11150182.",,70,1,1,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0734-2829,1557-5144,,J PSYCHOEDUC ASSESS,J.

This three-way interaction relies on social-exchange and trait activation theories, highlighting that the translation of novel thoughts into implementation depends on contextual activation of individual dispositions.

In a randomized trial, the program showed moderate to large impacts on classroom quality but no impacts on targeted child outcomes. To unpack these findings, we examined intervention fidelity (IF) in both treatment and control groups. Specifically, the study examined (a) whether teachers in the treatment group showed greater fidelity to teaching practices prescribed by the intervention, as measured by dosage and adherence, at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten, than their control-group counterparts; and (b) whether language and literacy instructional dosage predicted gains in children's language and literacy outcomes at the end of prekindergarten and the end of kindergarten. IF data were coded minute by minute from videotapes of study classrooms collected at the beginning of prekindergarten, the end of prekindergarten, and the end of kindergarten. There were significant and large impacts of the intervention on dosage and adherence. Additionally, small but statistically significant associations were found between 2-year accumulated overall program dosage and children's reading and writing skills at the end of kindergarten. Results reveal that teacher practices changed in response to the intervention, but that increases in time spent on language and literacy instruction were not very substantial. This pattern may explain the absence of an overall impact on children's skills in the experimental study. Findings have implications for the design of both future preschool interventions and IF studies.","[Mendive, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Macul 7820436, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Weiland, Christina] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Yoshikawa, Hirokazu] NYU, Steinhardt Sch Culture Educ & Human Dev, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Snow, Catherine] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Mendive, S (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Macul 7820436, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",smendive@uc.cl,"Mendive, Susana/B-2095-2017","Mendive, Susana/0000-0002-9436-3974",Ministry of Education of Chile through Fondo de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Educacion [FONIDE F611106]; Fondo de Innovacion Academica [1113]; Fundacion Educacional Oportunidad; Harvard Graduate School of Education,"The implementation study on this research was supported by the Ministry of Education of Chile, through the Fondo de Investigacion y Desarrollo en Educacion (Research Project Number: FONIDE F611106, Year 2011), and support for writing this article was given by Fondo de Innovacion Academica project number 1113.

First, using a multilevel analytic approach (n=2597), the study shows that, after controlling for socio-demographic variables and the university admission tests, writing skills significantly predict first-year university grades. Second, using information about the performance of students during their first eight semesters in the university (n = 1616), a longitudinal hierarchical analysis showed that writing remains a significant predictor of university grades over time, also after controlling socio-demographic variables and university admissions tests. Moreover, language skills retain or improve their predictive role over time, whereas mathematics skills seem to decrease in their importance.

In order to reach this, a structural equation modeling was used. A total of 158 preschool students (ages ranging from 52 to 64 months) participated in the investigation. Students were assessed with informal tasks measuring mathematical thinking, numerical estimation, symbolic and non-symbolic comparison making, coding, receptive vocabulary, and backward digit span. Results showed that domain-general (specially working memory) was the highest impact of the general-domain predictors on informal mathematical competencies and a limited specific-domain factor effects for magnitude comparison.

The study yielded a validated Spanish language version of the PIMRS Teacher Form and offers a model of scale validation for other scholars who are interested in preparing an instrument for use outside of its culture of origin. The researchers used a back translation and expert panel procedure combined with psychometric analysis in order to achieve cultural equivalency for the translation. Psychometric properties of reliability (G Theory test of reliability) and validity (CFA, Rasch analysis) of the new version were assessed and compared to the original version in order to underpin its validity. The validation study employed a sample of 595 teachers and 26 principals in Santiago, Chile. The study yielded both a comprehensive analytical approach to cultural adaptation of survey instruments, as well a scale that can be used in Spanish speaking contexts.

Although universities have been collecting educational data for years, the adoption of LA in this region is still limited due to the lack of expertise and policies for processing and using educational data. In order to get a better picture of how existing data-related practices and policies might affect the incorporation of LA in Latin American institutions, we conducted a mixed methods study in four Latin American universities (two Chilean and two Ecuadorian). In this paper, the qualitative data were based on 37 interviews with managers and 16 focus groups with 51 teaching staff and 45 students; the quantitative data were collected through two surveys answered by 1884 students and 368 teachers, respectively. The findings reveal opportunities to incorporate LA services into existing data practices in the four case studies. However, the lack of reliable information systems and policies to regulate the use of data imposes challenges that need to be overcome for future LA adoption.","[Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Engn Sch, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita] ESPOL, Informat Technol Ctr, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola] Univ Cuenca, Fac Engn, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Pesantez-Cabrera, Paola] Univ Cuenca, Dept Comp Sci, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Scheihing, Eliana] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Informat, Valdivia, Chile; [Tsai, Yi-Shan; Gasevic, Dragan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Tsai, Yi-Shan] Moray House Sch Educ, Ctr Res Digital Educ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Munoz-Merino, Pedro J.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Engn & Sci Educ Ctr, Leuven, Belgium; [Broos, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Augment HCI Res Grp, Dept Comp Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Whitelock-Wainwright, Alexander] Monash Univ, Portfolio DVC & VP Educ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Gasevic, Dragan] Monash Univ, Learning Analyt, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Gasevic, Dragan] Monash Univ, Ctr Learning Analyt, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Tolouse III, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Tolouse, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Hilliger, I (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Engn Sch, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",ihillige@ing.puc.cl,"Gasevic, Dragan/AAT-3909-2020; Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/V-7329-2017; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/E-1678-2011; Broos, Tom/F-5424-2017; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Gasevic, Dragan/0000-0001-9265-1908; Ortiz-Rojas, Margarita/0000-0003-2193-8316; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/0000-0002-2552-4674; Broos, Tom/0000-0002-4139-2608; Scheihing, Eliana/0000-0003-1801-9167; Tsai, Yi-Shan/0000-0001-8967-5327; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963",LALA project [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre,"This work was funded by the LALA project (grant no. 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP).

The IE-basic progam is aimed at enhancing domain-general cognitive functioning in a number of areas (systematic perception, self-regulation abilities, conceptual vocabulary, planning, decoding emotions and social relations) as well as transferring learnt principles to daily life domains. Participants were children with DCD, CP, intellectual impairment of genetic origin, autistic spectrum disorder, ADHD or other learning disorders, with a mental age of 5-7 years, from Canada, Chile, Belgium, Italy and Israel. Children in the experimental groups (N = 104) received 27-90 h of the program during 30-45 weeks; the comparison groups (N = 72) received general occupational and sensory-motor therapy. Analysis of the pre- to post-test gain scores demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) advantage of experimental over comparison groups in three WISC-R subtests (Similarities, Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement) and Raven Coloured Matrices. Effect sizes ranged from 0.3 to 0.52. Results suggest that it is possible to improve cognitive functioning of children with developmental disability. No advantage was found for children with specific aetiology. Greater cognitive gains were demonstrated by children who received the program in an educational context where all teachers were committed to the principles of mediated learning.

One of the approaches to this type of innovation consists of using the platforms where MOOCs are hosted for the development of courses that are aligned to their on-campus curricular contents. They are known as Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs), which allow online access to knowledge for groups of students with a well-defined profile. The platforms where MOOCs (and SPOCs) are hosted have been designed to support large volumes of data and visits. However, these platforms present important limitations regarding the implementation of collaborative learning activities. To address this problem, this article presents MyMOOCSpace, a cloud-based mobile system aimed at supporting effective collaboration in MOOCs, by combining key aspects of collaboration from the research area of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) with game-based dynamics. MyMOOCSpace has been tested in three quasi-experiments that were run in four Latin-American universities with a total of 68 participants. The objective was to assess its usability and its effect in enhancing collaboration among students in a SPOC. The results obtained on usability show that MyMOOCSpace is easy to use, and that participants felt pleased with while using it. Finally, it was observed that MyMOOCSpace managed to enhance interaction and collaboration among students.","[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Rojas-Riethmuller, Juan S.; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DCC, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Ramirez-Donoso, Luis] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Santiago, Chile; [Alario-Hoyos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Leganes, Spain",,"Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DCC, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",llramirez@uc.cl,"Neyem, Andres/D-2145-2014; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Neyem, Andres/0000-0002-5734-722X; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [21161264]; Corfo Project 2030 - Chile [14ENI2-26862]; MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; DIPEI [PPI-2015-371]; UBO'H Rect [1000/532/14]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231],"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant number: 21161264; Corfo Project 2030 - Chile, Grant number: 14ENI2-26862; MOOC-Maker, Grant number: 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP; DIPEI, Grant number: PPI-2015-371; UBO'H Rect, Grant number: 1000/532/14; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant number: 11150231",,68,12,12,2,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

It is in this context that students use a variety of practices to prepare assessments and exams appropriately. On the other hand, in recent years, higher education institutions have been using the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as an alternative to expand and innovate their traditional classroom practices. In this field, some alternatives have been generated in these platforms to extend their functions beyond the courses proposed. MyMOOCSpace is a cloud-based tool that improves the interaction of students participating in a MOOC course. However, a variation of this tool allows for improved collaboration and preparation of assessments and/or tests for students in a traditional higher education class. This article presents a study using the MyMOOCSpace tool as an alternative to encourage collaboration and preparation of students to take traditional tests or assessments in the field of higher education. To evaluate this application and demonstrate the impact on the results of the evaluations, a case study is presented in which 40 computer engineering students from a Chilean university participated. The results show that MyMOOCSpace generates a positive increase in student interaction regarding the subjects covered in the course, and that it helped them to study and prepare for the final exam of the subject.","[Ramirez-Donoso, Luis; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar; Neyem, Andres] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Ramirez-Donoso, Luis] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, FICT, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Toulouse, France",,"Ramirez-Donoso, L (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, DCC, Santiago, Chile.",llramirez@uc.cl,"Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963",Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile [1000/532/14]; Corfo Project 2030 [14ENI2-26862]; MOOCMaker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21161264],"Scholarship of Universidad Bernardo O' Higgins in Santiago de Chile, Grant number: UBO' H Rect.

Depending on which part is needed to recover, the denser product or the pure liquid, we use the term thickening or clarification to define these operations. Thickener design is compulsory for chemical engineering (CE) curricula and is usually introduced in courses related to unit operations. Thickening design problems are solved by geometric methods (e.g., Coe-Clevenger or Kynch-Roberts methods). However, nowadays, computers play a more and more important role in CE practice. Both specific and general software solutions are essential. Whereas CE-specific software is adequate for graduates and professionals, general mathematical software can also be used in class. They can help to deliver certain competences included in the vast majority of CE curricula. For CE introductory courses, software with integrated functions and friendly interfaces are generally preferred over those that require to be familiarized with programming languages. Here, we describe the use of SMath Studio in 2nd-year engineering courses by nonfamiliarized students. SMath Studio is a comprehensive mathematical notebook, similar to Mathcad, but it is entirely free for personal or commercial use. In this study, student's opinion was surveyed. Around 70 students took part in the two-phase survey. The use of SMath allowed students to better understand the theoretical basis, fostered critical thinking, and increased their motivation to apply this software for solving other engineering problems.","[Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Navarro-Lopez, Elvira; del Carmen Ceron-Garcia, Maria; Beas-Catena, Alba; Sanchez-Miron, Asterio; Garcia-Camacho, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Beas-Catena, Alba] Univ Concepcion, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Concepcion, Chile; [Ruiz-Ortega, Ana; Beas-Catena, Alba] Andres Bello Univ, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Dept Humanities, Concepcion, Chile",,"Gallardo-Rodriguez, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.",jgr285@ual.es,,"Sanchez Miron, Asterio/0000-0001-5119-8035; Gallardo Rodriguez, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2953-7699",University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project) [17-003],"University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project)., Grant/Award Number: 17-003",,15,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-3773,1099-0542,,COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC,Comput.

Literature shows medical students' deficiencies in these skills. Simulation has been used to train these skills. However, exposing learners to simulation at an early stage may be associated with a high cognitive load and limited learning. This study aims to determine how students experience this load and its interplay with performance and which factors promote and impair learning.Methods: Fifty-six final year medical students participated in a simulated ward round training exercise. Both students' performance and cognitive load were measured to determine if there was any correlation and interviews were carried out to understand which factors support and impair learning.Results: Performance scores revealed deficiencies in ward round skills. Students experienced a cognitive load that weakly correlated with performance. Qualitative findings provided important insights into simulated ward-based learning. It is clear that well-designed clinical scenarios, prioritization tasks, teamwork and feedback support students' learning process whereas distractions impair learning.Conclusions: WRS proved to be a good teaching method to improve clinical skills at this stage as the cognitive load is not too high to impair learning. Hence, including tasks in the simulation design can enhance the learning process.","[Behrens, Claudia] Univ Catolica Norte, Med Educ Unit, Coquimbo, Chile; [Dolmans, Diana H. J.

Methods A cross-sectional design study with a sample of 265 dentistry students was carried out. Results Using structural equation modelling, confirmatory factor analysis verified the adequacy of four-factor model, although the only factor that directly predicts behavioural intention is performance expectancy. Internal consistency coefficients of each factor ranged from 0.800 to 0.969. Discussion These findings, as well as the predictive power of performance expectancy on behaviour intention, are in line with previous evidence found in the literature. Conclusion These findings suggest that the UTAUT scale has adequate reliability and construct factorial validity; therefore, UTAUT model could be a valuable approach to assess haptic virtual simulator acceptance in dental education.","[Gonzalez Bravo, Luis] Univ Concepcion, Directorate Strateg Studies, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion, Chile; [Gonzalez Bravo, Luis] Ludwig Maximillans Univ Munchen, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Munich, Germany; [Fernandez Sagredo, Marcelo; Torres Martinez, Pilar; Barrios Penna, Carolina; Fonseca Molina, Juan] Univ San Sebastian, Fac Dent, Dent Dept, Concepcion, Chile; [Dorin Stanciu, Ionut; Nistor, Nicolae] Walden Univ, Richard W Riley Coll Educ & Leadership, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Dorin Stanciu, Ionut] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Psychol & Educ, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Nistor, Nicolae] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munchen, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Munich, Germany",,"Bravo, LG (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Directorate Strateg Studies, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion, Chile.",lgonzalez@udec.cl,,"Fonseca, Juan/0000-0003-4489-3456; Fernandez, Marcelo/0000-0002-6980-6219; Nistor, Nicolae/0000-0002-9956-1670; Gonzalez-Bravo, Luis/0000-0001-7310-3762",,,,69,4,4,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

According to these policies, older persons should become full participants in the development process of a society, sharing in its benefits, while policies and actions should promote a positive view of aging. The present paper sets out to report some of the results from the evaluation of four PUMAs offered in 20092010 at four Universities: Autonoma University of Madrid (Spain), Autonoma University of Mexico (Mexico), Catholic University (Chile), and La Habana University (Cuba). With this purpose, a study with quasiexperimental design and nonequivalent control group was carried out. In total, 313 students (75% women, age range 5087) on these four PUMAs and 190 controls (77% female, age range 5091) participated in this evaluation study. Pre- and postexperimental and control comparisons results yielded significant differences in the expected direction: those people attending PUMAs significantly improved their self-perception of aging and group stereotypes, as well as significantly reduced their negative affect, and improving their emotional balance. At the same time, their perception of cultural age stereotypes became more negative. The results are discussed from the point of view of the II International Plan of Action on Aging objectives: the reduction of negative stereotypes and the promotion of the role of PUMAs in active aging.","[Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio; Marta Santacreu, Lda.; Dolores Zamarron, Maria] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol & Hlth Psychol, Fac Psychol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Caprara, Mariagiovanna] Madrid Open Univ, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Schettini, Rocio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Univ Program Older Adults, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Bustillos, Antonio] Spanish Open Univ, Social Dept, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Mendoza-Nunez, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Orosa, Teresa] Univ La Habana, Fac Psychol, Havana, Cuba; [Kornfeld, Rosita; Rojas, Macarena] Catholic Univ Chile, Fac Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Dolores Lopez, Maria] La Salle Univ, Fac Psychol, Madrid, Spain; [Angeles Molina, Maria] Inst Adv Social Studies, Cordoba, Spain",,"Fernandez-Ballesteros, R (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol & Hlth Psychol, Fac Psychol, Ivan Pavlov 6, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",r.fballesteros@uam.es,"Molina, M» çngeles/ABG-9931-2020; Bustillos, Antonio/L-4668-2014; Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio/C-6503-2011; Schettini, Roc’o/ABH-1833-2020; Mangeles, Molina/ABH-4292-2020; Zamarr—n, Loles/L-4879-2013; Molina, M» çngeles/L-2185-2014; Caprara, Mariagiovanna/ABH-4424-2020; SANTACREU, MARTA/AAA-2882-2019; Schettini, Roc’o/ABA-8169-2021","Molina, M» çngeles/0000-0001-9354-6763; Bustillos, Antonio/0000-0003-2142-9335; Fernandez-Ballesteros, Rocio/0000-0001-7357-9082; Schettini, Roc’o/0000-0002-5985-5164; Zamarr—n, Loles/0000-0001-8500-9765; Caprara, Mariagiovanna/0000-0001-7560-4966; SANTACREU, MARTA/0000-0003-4108-7635;",,,,36,20,21,2,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0360-1277,1521-0472,,EDUC GERONTOL,Educ.

Understanding the learning development of educators in Intercultural and Bilingual Education (IBE) preschools for the education of Indigenous peoples is the focus of this study. In this context, the overall research question of this study is: What learning occurs for teachers in IBE preschools in the Metropolitan Region, Chile and how does this learning happen? Using Engestrom's expansive learning model (2001) and an ethnographic approach, this study found peer learning to be a critical but untapped resource for teacher learning in this setting, and also found there to be differences between Mapuche and non Mapuche teachers' understandings of the goals of their learning. Implications point to setting up teacher learning based on a model of peer learning which focuses on Mapuche educators contributing more than they currently do to the learning of non-Mapuche teachers in IBE preschools.","[Becerra-Lubies, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarr, Villarrica, Chile; [Varghese, Manka] Univ Washington, Coll Educ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Becerra-Lubies, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarr, Villarrica, Chile.",rubecerra@uc.cl,,,[CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746],This work was supported by Grant CONICYT/FONDECYT/11160746,,51,0,0,4,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

The study draws on emerging descriptions of field and discourse semantics in Systemic Functional Linguistics that are inspired by Halliday's distinction between 'live' and 'dead' grammatical metaphors. It first presents a metalanguage to discriminate functions of nominalization. Two different kinds of 'mismatches' of meaning are discussed, including how field activities are reconstrued through discourse semantic resources, and how discourse semantic resources are remapped as lexicogrammatical resources. The paper attends to nominalization from the perspective of the knowledge that is at stake in its use. In addition to providing linguistic metalanguage, the paper demonstrates pedagogic practices designed to support teachers to make this knowledge visible. These pedagogic practices include cross-mode redescription and Detailed Reading from SFL-informed Reading to Learn pedagogy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, there is a recent debate concerning whether teachers are (or should be) willing to engage with research. To investigate the research-pedagogy link, the current case study conducted interviews with 12 EFL teachers in Chile. The findings suggested that teachers' understanding of research was relatively consistent with SLA researchers' practices, although their awareness of instructionally oriented research was low. Teachers were willing to use research because it gave them emotional support and helped them deal with novel pedagogical issues. The use of research was facilitated by external pressure in the current landscape of higher education. However, teachers lacked physical accessibility to research such as time and resources as well as institutional support. They shared invaluable advice to researchers in promoting the research-pedagogy dialogue, such as creating communities of practice and conducting classroom research.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile; [Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist & German Slav Asian & African Langu, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Second Language Studies Doctoral Programme, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl; loewens@msu.edu,"Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019","Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile [FONDECYT: 1181533],This work was partially supported by the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico from the Ministry of Education of Chile (FONDECYT: 1181533) awarded to the first author as the co-investigator.,,14,22,23,3,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0951-0893,1477-4526,,ELT J,ELT J.,JAN,2019,73,1,,,,,1,10,,10.1093/elt/ccy048,,,10,Education & Educational Research; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,HQ7BM,WOS:000462574400001,,Bronze,,,2022-04-06,Otro,elt journal,Q3

Data analysis was guided by activity theory, examining how learners approached the tasks, including deliberations about language (actions), the group dynamics, and their use of mediating tools (e.g., L1). Our findings revealed differences in the learners' actions in these two contexts, both expected (e.g., use of L1) and unexpected (e.g., the nature of assistance provided).

These challenges require new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between language and content as well as new pedagogies that incorporate a dual focus on language and content in subject matter instruction. This article describes three professional development contexts in the U. S., where teachers have engaged in language analysis based on functional linguistics ( for example, Halliday & Hasan, 1989; Christie, 1989) that has given them new insights into both content and learning processes. In these contexts, teachers in history classrooms with English Language Learners and teachers of languages other than English in classrooms with heritage speakers needed support to develop students' academic language development in a second language. The functional linguistics metalanguage and analysis skills they developed gave them new ways of approaching the texts read and written in their classrooms and enabled them to recognize how language constructs the content they are teaching, to critically assess how the content is presented in their teaching materials, and to engage students in richer conversation about content.","[Achugar, Mariana] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Schleppegrell, Mary] Univ Michigan, Sch Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Oteiza, Teresa] Univ Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",,"Achugar, M (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Oteiza, Teresa/R-9310-2019",,,,,49,57,58,1,12,UNIV WAIKATO,HAMILTON,"SCH EDUCATION, PRIVATE BAG 3105, HAMILTON, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",1175-8708,,,ENGL TEACH-PRAT CRIT,Eng.

We conducted four interviews with people who live and use bicycles in that city. The methodological trajectory followed Phenomenology's view on situated phenomena. In the construction of results, the units of meaning a) fight for recognition of the right to enjoy territory by bicycle; b) solidarity with others in safe sharing of public roads; c) perception of the environment and d) communication of the bicycling activist movement resulted in the category Pedaling as a human right to active mobility in the city.

This qualitative study aims to analyze how the representation of others' suffering in films affects youths' empathy towards others different from them in terms of generation and cultural distance. We explore how empathy is expressed as semiotic processes of feelings and meanings in a contrastive cross-cultural case study. Using data collected from two college level language classrooms in two different countries (Uruguay and Chile) from two groups (one of regular university students and one of study abroad students), we contrast youths' responses to a film about violations of human rights during the Uruguayan military dictatorship (Migas de Pan, 2016). The film's representation of the violation of human rights experienced by young people during the dictatorship enables audiences to identify with the protagonist in spite of the temporal and cultural distance that separates them. Our findings suggest that the semiotic construction of feelings distinguishes the degree and intensity of youths' understanding of others' experiences. The conclusion discusses how personal trajectories and sociocultural identities influence the meaning making process of past experiences. Finally, we explore possible educational implications of these findings. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It identifies personal, professional and institutional barriers to achieving this social role and considers proposals from the teachers to overcome these barriers. Three focus groups were created and 12 in-depth interviews were carried out. The methods of analysis employed were anchored in the perspectives of fragmentation and articulation, as expressed in grounded theory. The paper concludes that, for some teachers, a dichotomic relationship exists between a physical education that reproduces a traditional approach (linked to sports and physical condition) and some specific social stereotypes, while for other teachers this relationship is a complementary one. There is another perspective that suggests that physical education can help develop the ability among students to comprehend and transform social inequalities.","[Moreno-Dona, Alberto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Escuela Educ Fis, Valparaiso, Chile; [Rivera-Garcia, Enrique; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Educ, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,"Moreno-Dona, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Filosofia & Educ, Escuela Educ Fis, Grp Estudio Motricidad & Educ, Ave El Bosque 1290, Valparaiso, Chile.",alberto.mo-reno@ucv.cl; erivera@ugr.es; ctriguer@ugr.es,"Moreno-Do–a, Alberto/ABG-2494-2020; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen/B-4116-2014; Rivera-Garc’a, Enrique/J-7260-2017","Moreno-Do–a, Alberto/0000-0002-4277-0535; Trigueros-Cervantes, Carmen/0000-0001-7870-1411; Rivera-Garc’a, Enrique/0000-0002-7748-1741",,,,39,5,7,0,22,"UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO SUL, ESCOLA EDUC FISICA",PORTO ALEGRE,"RUA FELIZARDO, 750 JARDIM BOTANICO, PORTO ALEGRE, CEP90690-200, BRAZIL",0104-754X,,,MOVIMENTO-PORTO ALEG,Movimento,,2014,20,,,,SI,,81,96,,,,,16,"Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,CC5KI,WOS:000350397100008,,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,movimento,Q4

With a focus on the interventions listeners may deem relevant for comprehension and task completion, the aim of this qualitative study is to examine the interactions of language learners as they use, or do not use, these potentially assistive resources. Data were gathered from 15 adult learners of English who worked with a set of Longman English Interactive (c) (2008) listening exercises over three one-hour sessions. Within two studies, each participant was interviewed on three and six different occasions.

This review surveys the instructed SLA research, both classroom and laboratory-based, that has been conducted primarily within the interactionist approach, beginning with the core constructs of interaction, namely input, negotiation for meaning, and output. The review continues with an overview of specific areas of interaction research. The first investigates interlocutor characteristics, including (a) first language (L1) status, (b) peer interaction, (c) participation structure, (d) second language (L2) proficiency, and (e) individual differences. The second topic is task characteristics, such as task conditions (e.g. information distribution, task goals), task complexity (i.e. simple or complex), and task participation structure (i.e. whole class, small groups or dyads). Next, the review considers various linguistic features that have been researched in relation to interaction and L2 learning. The review then continues with interactional contexts, focusing especially on research into computer-mediated interaction. The review ends with a consideration of methodological issues in interaction research, such as the merits of classroom and lab-based studies, and the various methods for measuring the noticing of linguistic forms during interaction. In sum, research has found interaction to be effective in promoting L2 development; however, there are numerous factors that impact its efficacy.","[Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist German Slav Asian & African Languag, Language Studies Programme 2, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Loewen, Shawn] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist German Slav Asian & African Languag, MATESOL Programme, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Santiago, Chile",,"Loewen, S (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist German Slav Asian & African Languag, Language Studies Programme 2, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Loewen, S (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist German Slav Asian & African Languag, MATESOL Programme, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",loewens@msu.edu; masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,"Sato, Masatoshi/N-1744-2019","Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",,,,267,57,58,26,78,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0261-4448,1475-3049,,LANG TEACHING,Lang.

This paper aims to discuss the research issues and policy implications critical for achieving such a curriculum goal. A review of literature in the related fields indicates that K-12 schools should take advantage of e-learning to maximize learning opportunities of learners for the development of 21st century skills. We identify six research issues critical for e-learning in school education, namely the realization of developing 21st century skills of learners; the bridging of the gap between curriculum in school and situations in society; the maximization of learning opportunities in the learning process; the collection of evidence of improvement and building awareness of progress; the assessment of 21st century skills; and the provision of teacher development for enculturating learners to develop 21st century skills. We recommend the relevant stakeholders across different countries/regions to consider policies on the goal-setting of curriculum addressing 21st century skills development and bridging gap between school and society; on the availability of digital technology for school education; on the privacy/legal issues of learning data in e-learning process; and on the teacher development for pre-service and in-service teachers.","[Kong, Siu Cheung; So, Wing Mui Winnie] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chan, Tak-Wai] Natl Cent Univ, Zhongli City, Taiwan; [Griffin, Patrick] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Hoppe, Ulrich] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Huang, Ronghuai; Yu, Shengquan] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kinshuk] Athabasca Univ, Athabasca, AB, Canada; [Looi, Chee Kit] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Milrad, Marcelo] Linnaeus Univ, Kalmar, Sweden; [Norris, Cathleen] Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Nussbaum, Miguel] Catholic Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Soloway, Elliot] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Kong, SC (corresponding author), Hong Kong Inst Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",sckong@ied.edu.hk; chan@cl.ncu.edu.tw; p.griffin@unimelb.edu.au; hoppe@collide.info; huangrh@bnu.edu.cn; kinshuk@athabascau.ca; cheekit.looi@nie.edu.sg; marcelo.milrad@lnu.se; norris@unt.edu; mn@ing.puc.cl; mike.sharples@open.ac.uk; wiso@ied.edu.hk; soloway@umich.edu; yusq@bnu.edu.cn,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Looi, Chee-Kit/ABG-9043-2021","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; So, Wing-mui Winnie/0000-0002-9649-074X",,,,34,34,35,1,73,"NATL YUNLIN UNIV SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, TAIWAN",DOULIU CITY,"NO 123, SECTION 3, DAXUE RD, DOULIU CITY, YUNLIN COUNTY, TAIWAN",1176-3647,1436-4522,,EDUC TECHNOL SOC,Educ.

Adolescents who were uninvolved in problem behavior and perceived their parents to be supportive or high in monitoring at Wave 1 were more likely to endorse parental legitimacy and obligation to obey over time.

Little is known about the factors explaining this variability, and consequently there is a lack of adequate knowledge about how to utilize this association to improve treatment. The present study had the following objectives: (a) to examine the associations between within-and between-individual variability in alliance and outcome, controlling for previous symptomatic levels; (b) to examine the duration of the alliance-outcome association; and (c) to examine potential moderators of the alliance-outcome association. A total of 547 patients treated in a primary care psychotherapy setting in Chile were randomly assigned to 5 feedback conditions. The alliance-outcome association was analyzed using multilevel models, disentangling changes in alliance within-individuals from alliance between-individuals. Patient and therapist characteristics were examined as potential moderators. Findings suggest that patients who reported a better early alliance also reported a better outcome. Furthermore, patients reporting time-specific improvement in alliance also reported a greater reduction in symptoms. The unique effect of alliance on outcome at one point in time is maintained for a period of 2 weeks. Patients with more severe symptoms and longer treatments benefited more from a good alliance. Therapists identifying themselves as more integrative in their treatment orientation were able to better utilize good alliances for treatment success. Finally, the size of the alliance-outcome association can be manipulated by feedback to therapists.","[Zilcha-Mano, Sigal] Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Errazuriz, Paula] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Santiago, Chile",,"Zilcha-Mano, S (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",sigalzil@gmail.com; paulae@uc.cl,,"Zilcha-Mano, Sigal/0000-0002-5645-4429","Chilean National Fund for Science and Technology (CONICYT) [11110041, 15110017]","This project was funded by the Chilean National Fund for Science and Technology (CONICYT), projects FONDECYT 11110041 and FONDAP 15110017.

Most theories and practical applications stem from individual sciences and frequently conclude with generalizations that cannot be derived from the specific scientific paradigm. It seems necessary to mark the limitations of individual scientific approaches and to detect where interdisciplinary perspectives are indispensable. This article is an attempt to investigate the interdependence and complementarity of neurobiological, psychological, and socio-cultural, as well as practical, aspects of creativity. It is shown that creativity is often a dialectical process apparent in psychological, cultural, and even neurobiological research. The dialectic of order and chaos seems to be a general concept that is conceived differently by the individual sciences and transports different meaning. However, it is shown that different scientific concepts also contain corresponding and complementary knowledge which amplifies scientific perspectives through interdisciplinary interpretation. The dialectics between coherence-incoherence, stabilization-destabilization, construction-deconstruction of cognitions, emotions, and actions are shown to be corresponding and complementary principles. The interdisciplinary interpretation of the findings of individual sciences leads to practical implications.","[Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M.] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Holm-Hadulla, Rainer M.] Univ Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile",,"Holm-Hadulla, RM (corresponding author), Univ Altklinikum, Gartenstr 2, D-691115 Heidelberg, Germany.",Rainer.Holm-Hadulla@stw.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,61,19,22,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-0419,1532-6934,,CREATIVITY RES J,Creativ.

Participants were first- and second-born siblings (M age = 14.94 years for firstborns and M age = 12.46 years for secondborns) from 185 predominantly White, working and middle-class families. In home interviews, siblings reported on their dyadic family relationships. For reports of parent-child warmth but not parent-child conflict, results were consistent with sibling differentiation theory: Increasing differences between siblings over time in parent-child warmth were linked to trajectories of increasing warmth and decreasing conflict in the sibling relationship as reported by firstborns, and increasing warmth in the sibling relationship as reported by secondborns. The findings support the view that sibling differentiation may be a strategy for managing sibling conflict and rivalry.","Penn State Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Catholic Univ Chile, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Feinberg, ME (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, 109 S Henderson, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mfeinberg@psu.edu,"Cumsille, Patricio/M-3564-2014",,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD029409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01-HD29409] Funding Source: Medline,,,38,63,65,6,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0009-3920,1467-8624,,CHILD DEV,Child Dev.,SEP-OCT,2003,74,5,,,,,1261,1274,,10.1111/1467-8624.00606,,,14,"Psychology, Educational; Psychology, Developmental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,725HF,WOS:000185537600003,14552397,,,,2022-04-06,Otro,child development,Q1

Younger adolescents with fewer problem behaviors, higher self-efficacy, and more parental rules were more likely to espouse the parent control belief pattern.

Whilst the directive includes dental practitioners, it is recognised that significant variation exists in curriculum structure, content and scope of practice across institutions. This article aimed to explore pan-European practice in relation to curriculum content, teaching and learning strategies and assessment of pre-clinical dental skills. MethodA request to complete an online questionnaire, in English, was sent electronically to skills leads at all Association of Dental Education in Europe member schools. The questionnaire collected information in relation to institution and country, regulatory requirements to demonstrate safety, details of specific pre-clinical skills courses, learning materials and teaching staff. ResultsForty-eight institutions, from 25 European countries responded. Seven countries (n=7, 28%) reported no requirement to demonstrate student operative safety prior to patient treatment. Several core and operative clinical skills are common to the majority of institutions. The most commonly taught core skills related directly to the clinical environment such as cross-infection control and hand washing. The least common were skills that indirectly related to patient care, such as communication skills and working as a team. ConclusionThere are clear differences within European pre-clinical dental education, and greater efforts are needed to demonstrate that all European students are fit to practice before they start treating patients. Learning outcomes, teaching activities and assessment activities of pre-clinical skills should be shared collaboratively to further standardise curricula.","[Field, J.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Stone, S.] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Orsini, C.; Crothers, A.] Glasgow Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Orsini, C.] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile; [Hussain, A.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Vital, S.] Univ Paris 05, Montrouge, France; [Walmsley, D.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",,"Field, J (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",j.c.field@sheffield.ac.uk,"Walmsley, Anthony D/V-8585-2018; Vital, Sibylle/AAK-3479-2021; Orsini, Cesar A./Y-6840-2019; Field, James/AAG-8901-2021","Vital, Sibylle/0000-0001-6352-2525; Orsini, Cesar A./0000-0002-5226-3625; Field, James/0000-0002-5462-4156; Walmsley, Damien/0000-0003-4970-0764; Stone, Simon/0000-0002-7426-3159",,,,17,8,8,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Data from three large-scale longitudinal data sets, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, and Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement, were used to answer this question by employing quantile regression analyses. After controlling for demographic variables, child characteristics, and early ability, the findings indicate that self-concept of ability in math and reading predicts later achievement in each respective domain across all quantile levels of achievement. These results were replicated across the three data sets representing different populations and provide robust evidence for the role of self-concept of ability in understanding achievement from early childhood to adolescence across the spectrum of performance (low to high).","[Ines Susperreguy, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Davis-Kean, Pamela E.; Chen, Meichu] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Susperreguy, MI (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",misusper@uc.cl,"Susperreguy, Maria Ines/F-3687-2015; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/AAD-5828-2019","Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Susperreguy, Maria Ines/0000-0001-5584-2692; Davis-Kean, Pamela/0000-0001-8389-6268","PATHWAYS International Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme for the Comparative Study of Productive Youth Development (Jacobs Foundation) at the Institute of Education, University College London; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [102215/2/13/2]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0322356]; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary ActivitiesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1519686] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G9815508, MC_PC_15018] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank Amy Claessens, Greg Duncan, Mimi Engel, Robert Siegler, and Tyler Watts for their helpful contributions to this project.

However, few studies have analysed this relationship regarding children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Down syndrome (DS). In this paper, we analyse the impact of SES in the neurodevelopmental trajectories of children with DS in comparison with children with TD. Method Cognitive, language, motor and socioemotional development were assessed in 31 children with DS between the ages of 15 and 8o months from high to low SES backgrounds. Data from this group were compared with data from a sample of 72 children with TD randomly selected from the Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood. We analyse and compare these two groups using the developmental trajectories method Results The results show delayed onsets for the four abilities measured in children with DS compared with children with TD from high to low SES. In the comparison of the developmental trajectories, we found that the differences between the neurodevelopmental trajectories in DS and 113 vary according to SES. High SES show differences only in language development, while low SES show significant differences in cognitive, language and socio-emotional development. Conclusions The results indicate that SES is a factor that could impact the developmental trajectories of children with DS. Although the differences between children with DS and with TD are similar at the beginning regardless of SES, the developmental trajectories are slower in children with DS of low SES than in children of high SES. We argue that the differences are related to the complex interaction of several biological and cultural factors associated with SES. Some specific hypotheses about nutrition, health care access, quality of education and parenting practices are presented, but more research in this area is needed to fully understand these results.","[Arango, P.

Gypsy communities were contacted, and the 35 Gypsy children in the 4th grade (10 to 12 years old) participating in the study were randomly distributed in the experimental and control groups. The program used a story-tool to organize the weekly sessions due to the cultural value of stories and the oral transmission of values in Gypsy communities. Children's behavioral engagement and self-regulatory behaviors in the classroom were assessed with an observation protocol. The 35 Gypsy children were observed throughout the duration of the program in 12 five-minute intervals for a total of 60 min.

The participants were 61 biology teachers and their corresponding 1,518 high school students (12th grade). The first sample was used to fit the model, and the second sample was used to analyze the consistency of the data derived from the first sample. Using a two-level SEM analysis, we established whether the effects found at the individual level varied significantly at class level. The students' approaches to learning were related to the teachers' approaches to teaching as a function of the hypotheses established in the model, although the effect size was smaller than expected. However, approximately 48 % of the variance of the surface approach and 46 % of the deep approach sat at class level. At the individual level, the results of this study suggest that students' approaches to learning significantly explain their teachers' approaches to teaching and, thus, constitute important contextual variables. At the class level, the way students learn appears to be closely associated with class-related variables. Our data stresses the importance of promoting educational opportunities (e.g., school-based courses) for teachers to reflect upon the teaching methodologies used in class.","[Rosario, Pedro; Paiva, Olimpia; Pinto, Ricardo] Univ Minho, Dept Psychol, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Carlos Nunez, Jose; Vallejo, Guilermo] Univ Oviedo, Asturias, Spain; [Valle, Antonio] Univ A Coruna, Galicia, Spain; [Fuentes, Sonia] Univ Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Rosario, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Psychol, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",prosario@psi.uminho.pt; jcnunezperez@gmail.com; gvallejoseco@gmail.com; olimpiapaiva0212@gmail.com; vallar@udc.es; rmnpslb@gmail.com,"Ros‡rio, Pedro/A-1775-2011; Valle, Antonio/A-6776-2013; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/H-4425-2013; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/AAE-9972-2021; Vallejo, Guillermo/B-8233-2011","Ros‡rio, Pedro/0000-0002-3221-1916; Valle, Antonio/0000-0001-8160-9181; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Nś–ez, JosŽ Carlos/0000-0002-9187-1201; Vallejo, Guillermo/0000-0002-8010-6854",,,,78,8,8,1,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0256-2928,1878-5174,,EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC,Eur.

Method Eighty-three families (fathers and mothers) answered self-report questionnaires, which assessed parenting styles and attitudes, as well as an adaptive behaviour questionnaire about their children with intellectual disabilities between 4 and 18 years of age. Results Both parents have a tendency towards an authoritative style of parenting. Fathers (versus mothers) perceive greater parental support but are less involved in their children's lives. Among fathers, the authoritative style was a significant contributor to the child's adaptive behaviour, above and beyond the mother's contribution. Conclusions Studies about parenting should include both mothers and fathers, as paternal parenting styles and attitudes are related to children's adaptive behaviour.","[Sabat, Camila; Arango, Paulina] Univ Los Andes, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile; [Sabat, Camila; Arango, Paulina] Millenium Inst Caregiving Res MICARE, Santiago, Chile; [Burke, Meghan M.] Univ Illinois, Coll Educ, Champaign, IL USA",,"Arango, P (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile.; Arango, P (corresponding author), Millenium Inst Caregiving Res MICARE, Santiago, Chile.",parango@uandes.cl,,"Sabat, Camila/0000-0003-3136-6796; Burke, Meghan/0000-0001-5287-2351; Arango, Paulina Sofia/0000-0002-9942-6997","Fondo de Apoyo a la Investigacion de Area Tematica Prioritaria (FAI ATP) from Universidad de los Andes, Chile [INV-AT-2017-39]; ANID Millennium Science Initiative [ICS2019_024]","This work was funded by the Fondo de Apoyo a la Investigacion de Area Tematica Prioritaria (FAI ATP), grant number: INV-AT-2017-39, from Universidad de los Andes, Chile.

The equating literature shows that the ways of judging the success of an equating (i.e., the score transformation) might differ depending on the adopted framework. Rather than targeting different parts of the equating process and aiming to evaluate the process from different aspects, this article views the equating transformation as a standard statistical estimator and discusses how this estimator should be assessed in an equating framework. For the kernel equating framework, a numerical illustration shows the potentials of viewing the equating transformation as a statistical estimator as opposed to assessing it using equating-specific criteria. A discussion on how this approach can be used to compare other equating estimators from different frameworks is also included.","[Wiberg, Marie] Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Gonzalez, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Fac Math, Casilla 306 Correo 22, Santiago, Chile",,"Wiberg, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Stat, Umea Sch Business Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.; Gonzalez, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Fac Math, Casilla 306 Correo 22, Santiago, Chile.",marie.wiberg@umu.se; jorge.gonzalez@mat.uc.cl,"Gonz‡lez, Jorge/R-7652-2019; Wiberg, Marie/X-2446-2019","Gonzalez, Jorge/0000-0003-0415-3795; Wiberg, Marie/0000-0001-5549-8262",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2014-578]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150233],The research in this article by Marie Wiberg was funded by the Swedish Research Council grant 2014-578.

In this sense, we will suggest that students' teleological views can be used as the starting point for the construction of knowledge in this area of biology. To establish possible didactic strategies, we will turn to the way Darwin himself dealt with the teleology of former naturalists: Darwin had to modify several aspects of the previous teleological thinking: He had to reform functional biology. We will develop an alternative approach to teleology problem by conceiving of the contemporary student as a pre-Darwinian teleologist. Working from there, we will sketch two possible approaches for dealing with the students' teleological thinking. The first approach seeks to modify the students' intuitive functional biology in order to bring it closer to the modified functional biology developed by Darwin but avoiding the use of notions from evolutionary biology. The second approach involves using theory of natural selection as a guide to reformulate the functional biology of the students.","[Ginnobili, Santiago; Ariza, Yefrin] Univ Nacl Quilmes UNQ, Ctr Estudios Filosofia & Hist Ciencia CEFHIC, Bernal, Argentina; [Ginnobili, Santiago; Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo] Univ Buenos Aires UBA, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Invest CeFIEC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Ariza, Yefrin] Univ Catolica Maule UCM, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Dept Biol & Quim, Talca, Chile",,"Ariza, Y (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Quilmes UNQ, Ctr Estudios Filosofia & Hist Ciencia CEFHIC, Bernal, Argentina.; Ariza, Y (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule UCM, Fac Ciencias Basicas, Dept Biol & Quim, Talca, Chile.",santi75@gmail.com; leomgalli@gmail.com; angelyefrin@hotmail.com,"; Ariza, Yefrin/Y-6115-2018","Ginnobili, Santiago/0000-0001-5375-965X; Ariza, Yefrin/0000-0002-1993-7245; Gonzalez Galli, Leonardo/0000-0002-0713-164X","Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina [0990/19]; Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero, Argentina [32/19 80120190100217TF]; ANPCyT, ArgentinaANPCyT [PICT-2014-1741, PICT-2014-03454]; UBACyT (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina)University of Buenos Aires [20020190201537BA, 20020190200085BA]","This work has been funded by the following research projects: PUNQ, 0990/19 (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina), UNTREF 32/19 80120190100217TF (Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero, Argentina), PICT-2014-1741 (ANPCyT, Argentina), PICT-2014-03454 (ANPCyT, Argentina), and UBACyT 20020190201537BA, 20020190200085BA (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina).",,103,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

However, the lack of valid and reliable instruments to estimate social accountability has limited the possibility of measuring the impact that medical schools have in society. Our aim was to develop an instrument and validate its use for assessing social accountability in Latin American countries. Methods:We used a three-phase mixed methods research design to develop, validate and estimate social accountability in a diverse convenient sample of 49 medical schools from 16 Latin American countries. We used a qualitative framework approach and a Delphi consensus method to design an instrument with high content validity. Finally, we assessed the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results:The Social Accountability Instrument for Latin America (SAIL)contained 21 items in four domains: mission and quality improvement, public policy, community engagement, and professional integrity. Its reliability index, estimated using Cronbach's alpha, was very high (0.96). Most of the medical schools that had ranked over the 80th percentile on traditional national academic estimates did not reach the 80th percentile using SAIL. Conclusions:There are validity arguments (content and reliability) to support the measurement of social accountability using the SAIL instrument. Its application showed that it provides a complementary dimension to that traditionally obtained when estimating quality in medical schools.","[Puschel, Klaus; Sapag, Jaime; Moore, Philippa] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Family Med, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo; Diaz, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Gastroenterol, Santiago, Chile; [Riquelme, Arnoldo; Fuentes-Lopez, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hlth Sci, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna Ave, Santiago, Chile; [de la Jara, Jorge Jimenez] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Publ Hlth, Santiago, Chile; [Burdick, William; Norcini, John] Fdn Adv Int Med Educ & Res, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Burdick, William] Drexel Univ, Coll Med, Dept Emergency Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Campos, Henry] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Valdez, Jorge E.] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Med, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Llosa, Maria Paola] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Sch Med, Lima, Peru; [Lamus-Lemus, Francisco] Univ La Sabana, Dept Med Educ, Cundinamarca, Colombia; [Yulitta, Horacio] Argentinean Paediat Soc, Evaluat Profess Board, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Grez, Marcela] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Santiago, Chile",,"Riquelme, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Hlth Sci, 4860 Vicuna Mackenna Ave, Santiago, Chile.",a.riquelme.perez@gmail.com,"Yulitta, Horacio/ABF-8296-2021","Diaz, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-8540-4930; MOORE, PHILIPPA/0000-0002-3578-7240",School of Medicine Pontificia Universidad Cat~olica de Chile [14-518],This work was supported by School of Medicine Pontificia Universidad Cat~olica de Chile [Grant funding 14-518].,,33,3,3,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-159X,1466-187X,,MED TEACH,Med.

However, we still do not know many specific details regarding how students and teachers learn particular aspects of NOS and what are the most important feature traits of instruction. In this context, the main objective of this review is to analyze articles from nine main science education journals that consider the teaching of NOS to K-12 students, pre-service, and in-service science teachers in search of patterns in teaching and learning NOS. After reviewing 52 studies in nine journals that included data regarding participants' views of NOS before and after an intervention, the main findings were as follows: (1) some aspects of NOS (empirical basis, observation and inference, and creativity) are easier to learn than others (tentativeness, theory and law, and social and cultural embeddedness), and subjective aspects of NOS and the scientific method seemed to be difficult for participants to understand; (2) the interventions most frequently lasted 5 to 8weeks for students, one semester for pre-service teachers, and 1year for experienced teachers; and (3) most of the interventions incorporated both decontextualized and contextualized activities. Given the substantial diversity in the methods and intervention designs used and the variables studied, it was not possible to infer a pattern of more-effective NOS teaching strategies from the reviewed studies. Future investigation should focus on (a) disentangling whether a difference exists between the easy and difficult aspects of learning NOS and formulating a theoretical explanation for distinguishing the two types of aspects and (b) assessing the effectiveness of different kinds of courses (e.g., history of science, NOS or informal) and strategies (e.g., hands-on vs. drama activities; SSI vs. HOS).","[Cofre, Hernan; Nunez, Paola] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Cofre, Hernan; Nunez, Paola; Valencia, Martina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Didact Ciencias Expt, Valparaiso, Chile; [Santibanez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Pavez, Jose M.] Univ Georgia, Coll Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Vergara, Claudia] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile",,"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Ave Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.; Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Didact Ciencias Expt, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@pucv.cl,,"Valencia, Martina/0000-0002-8144-5882; Pavez, Jose/0000-0002-4946-5496",,,,97,22,24,8,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

Higher Education institutions need their students to have basic understandings of the subjects to be imparted in the first semesters, but since they come with different backgrounds and prior knowledge, this is not always possible and many students struggle in their first courses. This paper presents the results of students' adoption and learning outcomes of using four MOOCs as a complementary study resource for an on-campus calculus diagnostic exam. Over 700 newly admitted university students had to take a mandatory diagnostic exam on four calculus topics before classes started. MOOCs were proposed as a voluntary support for studying these subjects. Following a mixed method analysis, we studied why and when the students used the online courses and we also measured the effects of its use in terms of the students' diagnostic exam grades and learning outcomes. The results show that students mostly used the MOOCs to study the subjects that were not covered in their secondary studies. Students who were active in these course topics obtained better scores, having more chances of passing the diagnostic exam than students who did not study with the MOOCs. Furthermore, students not only used the MOOCs for studying for the exam, but also for refreshing concepts for future courses.","[Hernandez, Josefina; Rodriguez, Fernanda; Hilliger, Isabel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 486, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Tolouse III Paul Sabatier, IRIT, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, Tolouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile Santiago, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile",,"Hernandez, J (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 486, Macul, Santiago De Chi, Chile.",jmherna1@uc.cl; mfrodri3@uc.cl; ihillige@ing.puc.cl; mar.perez@uc.cl,"Hilliger, Isabel/AAC-9920-2022; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; HERNANDEZ, JOSEFINA/0000-0002-2422-3634","Proyecto de Iniciacio_n Fondecyt [11150231]; Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy [14EN12-26862]; Erasmusp Programme of the European Union, MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]","This work was been supported in part by the Proyecto de Iniciacio_n Fondecyt under Grant 2015 No. 11150231, in part by the Clover 2030 Engineering Strategy under Grant 14EN12-26862, and in part by the Erasmusp Programme of the European Union, MOOC-Maker under Grant 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.t",,28,3,3,0,19,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

Recommendations by healthcare providers, family and friends have been associated with early detection strategies among US-based Latina populations, but little is known about other Latin American populations. Furthermore, less is known about mechanisms underlying this relationship. In this study, we sought to (i) understand if different types of recommendations were associated with subsequent plans to obtain a mammogram and (ii) assess the potential mediating roles of perceived importance of these recommendations and self-efficacy. Our sample included 250 women residing in a low-income, urban area of Santiago, Chile, and who had participated in a 6-month intervention to increase mammography screening, but remained noncompliant. Women who received family recommendations were more likely to indicate they planned to receive a mammogram in the next 6 months. Perceived self-efficacy mediated this relationship, such that women who received a family recommendation appeared to be more likely to plan to get a mammogram because of increased perceived capabilities to do so. Future research should consider the cultural context of family and self-efficacy in the development of screening interventions for Latinas.","[Molina, Yamile; Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera; Thompson, Beti] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Canc Prevent Program, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Molina, Yamile] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Chicago, IL USA; [Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera; Pueschel, Klaus] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Family & Community Med, Sch Med, Santiago, Chile; [Thompson, Beti] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Molina, Y (corresponding author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Canc Prevent Program, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",ymolina@fhcrc.org,"Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera/ABC-3719-2021","Martinez-Gutierrez, Javiera/0000-0002-2493-9974","FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R03 TW007900] Funding Source: Medline; NCI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA148143, P50 CA148143, U54 CA153502] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R03TW007900] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA148143, U54CA153502] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,38,16,16,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0268-1153,1465-3648,,HEALTH EDUC RES,Health Educ.

This is partially due to the lack of any assessment instrument to measure understandings about scientific inquiry. However, a valid and reliable assessment has recently been developed and published, Views About Scientific Inquiry (VASI; Lederman et al. [2014], Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51, 65-83). The purpose of this large-scale international project was to collect the first baseline data on what beginning middle school students have learned about scientific inquiry during their elementary school years. Eighteen countries/regions spanning six continents including 2,634 students participated in the study. The participating countries/regions were: Australia, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Mainland China, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. In many countries, science is not formally taught until middle school, which is the rationale for choosing seventh grade students for this investigation. This baseline data will simultaneously provide information on what, if anything, students learn about inquiry in elementary school, as well as their beginning knowledge as they enter secondary school. It is important to note that collecting data from all of the approximately 200 countries globally was not humanly possible, and it was also not possible to collect data from every region of each country. The results overwhelmingly show that students around the world at the beginning of grade seven have very little understandings about scientific inquiry. Some countries do show reasonable understandings in certain aspects but the overall picture of understandings of scientific inquiry is not what is hoped for after completing 6 years of elementary education in any country.","[Lederman, Judith; Lederman, Norman; Jimenez, Juan] IIT, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Bartels, Selina] Valparaiso Univ, Dept Educ, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA; [Akubo, Mark] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Aly, Shereen; EL-Deghaidy, Heba; ElZorkani, Ahmed] Amer Univ Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt; [Bao, Chengcheng; Lv, Bin; Wei, Fangbing; Wu, Zhifeng; Xiao, Huang] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Jinhua, Peoples R China; [Blanquet, Estelle] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; [Blanquet, Estelle] ESPE dAquitaine, Merignac, France; [Blonder, Ron] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [Soares de Andrade, Mariana Bologna] Univ Estadual Londrina, Londrina, Brazil; [Buntting, Catherine; Hume, Anne; Saunders, Kathy] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Cakir, Mustafa; Han-Tosunoglu, Cigdem; Irez, Serhat; Kivilcan Dogan, Ozgur] Marmara Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gaigher, Estelle] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Guo, Shuchen; Liu, Cheng; Liu, Enshan] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hakanen, Arvi; Lavonen, Jari] Helsingin Yliopisto, Helsinki, Finland; [Hamed Al-Lal, Soraya; Rivero Garcia, Ana] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Hattingh, Annemarie; Kay, Gillian] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Kremer, Kerstin; Neumann, Irene; Voitle, Frauke] IPN, Kiel, Germany; [Kuo, Pi-Chu] Natl Pingtung Univ, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Lin, Shu-Fen] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Changhua, Taiwan; [Liu, Shiang-Yao] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Mamlok-Naaman, Rachel] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [McDonald, Christine] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Pan, Yaozhen] Zhejiang Int Studies Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Picholle, Eric] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; [Rundgren, Carl-Johan; von Gyllenpalm, Jakob] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Santibanez-Gomez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Santiago, Chile; [Schwartz, Renee] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Wishart, Jocelyn] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Yalaki, Yalcin] Hacettepe Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Zhou, Qiaoxue] Shanghai Jingyang Middle Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Lederman, J (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.",ledermanj@iit.edu,"bartels, selina/AAK-9801-2020; Han-Tosunoglu, Cigdem/AAA-3583-2019; Yalaki, Yalcin/F-8639-2011; Schwartz, Renee S/Z-1610-2019; Dogan, Ozgur Kivilcan/G-2550-2013; Rivero, Ana AR/S-7384-2016; Akubo, Mark/AAF-5889-2019; Hume, Anne/H-9601-2013; irez, serhat/AAA-7473-2019; XIAO, HUANG/AAK-4252-2020; Kremer, Kerstin/AAA-9037-2020; Buntting, Cathy/AAI-1110-2020","Yalaki, Yalcin/0000-0003-0939-4766; Dogan, Ozgur Kivilcan/0000-0002-3213-2345; Rivero, Ana AR/0000-0002-3130-6905; Hume, Anne/0000-0002-9565-8045; irez, serhat/0000-0003-3294-4666; Kremer, Kerstin/0000-0003-2305-3650; Lederman, Judith/0000-0002-0515-9913; Lin, Shu-Fen/0000-0002-4037-4846; Buntting, Cathy/0000-0002-1507-9415; Han Tosunoglu, Cigdem/0000-0002-5904-656X; Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953; Lederman, Norman/0000-0003-0957-3887; Wishart, Jocelyn/0000-0002-8593-3728",,,,71,23,24,3,134,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4308,1098-2736,,J RES SCI TEACH,J.

Different instructional strategies such as decontextualized, hands-on inquiry, and history of science (HOS) activities have been proposed for teaching NOS. This article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology teachers' understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training. Teachers' views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews, and in the second session we collected information about teachers' perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers' understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated NOS. The relationship between teachers' improved understanding of NOS and their instructional NOS skills is also discussed.","[Pavez, Jose M.; Cofre, Hernan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Vergara, Claudia A.] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Filosofia & Humanidades, Santiago, Chile; [Santibanez, David] IIT, Math & Sci Educ Dept, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Santibanez, David] Univ Catolica Silva Henriquez, Fac Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Cofre, H (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Fac Ciencias, Av Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",hernan.cofre@ucv.cl,,"Pavez, Jose/0000-0002-4946-5496; Vergara, Claudia/0000-0003-3323-1457; , hernan/0000-0003-2789-334X",Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1131029],"This work was supported by the Chilean National Fund for Scientific and Technologic Development (FONDECYT), under Grant 1131029 to the first author.

Often, developers (generally, educators who know the subjects they teach but lack of the technical and programming skills required to build Internet-based educational applications) end up discarding the idea of exploring these new teaching and learning experiences mainly due to the technical issues that must be mastered. To tackle this problem, authors present a novel technique that allows developers to create remote labs in a quick, didactical, and straightforward way. This framework is based on the use of two well-known software tools in the scope of engineering education, Easy Java Simulations and LabVIEW. The development exploits a new feature of Easy Java Simulations known as EJS-elements that enables Java developers to create and integrate their own authoring libraries (elements) into EJS, thus increasing its application possibilities. Particularly, the EJS element here presented allows to LabVIEW programs be controlled from EJS applications through a communication network. This paper presents the element creation details and how this can be used to create web-enabled experimentation environments for educational purposes.

However, engineering mobile learning applications for outdoor usage poses severe challenges. The requirements of these applications are challenging, as many different aspects need to be catered, such as resource access and sharing, communication between peers, group management, activity flow, etc. Robustness is particularly important for learning scenarios to guarantee undisturbed and smooth user experiences, pushing the technological aspects in the background. Despite significant research in the field of mobile learning, very few efforts have focused on collaborative mobile learning requirements from a software engineering perspective. This paper focuses on aspects of the software architecture, aiming to address the challenges related to resource sharing in collaborative mobile learning activities. This includes elements such as autonomy for personal interactive learning, richness for large group collaborative learning (indoor and outdoor), as well as robustness of the learning system. Additionally, we present self-adaptation as a solution to mitigate risks of resource unavailability and organization failures that arise from environment and system dynamism. Our evaluation provides indications regarding the system correctness with respect to resource sharing and collaboration concerns, and offers qualitative evidence of self-adaptation benefits for collaborative mobile learning applications.","[de la Iglesia, Didac Gil] Linnaeus Univ, Media Technol, Kronoberg, Sweden; [Felipe Calderon, Juan; Nussbaum, Miguel] Escuela Ingn PUC, Dept Ciencia Computac, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Weyns, Danny] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Vaxjo, Smaland, Sweden; [Milrad, Marcelo] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Learning & Knowledge Technol CeLeKT, S-35195 Vaxjo, Kronoberg, Sweden",,"de la Iglesia, DG (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Media Technol, Kronoberg, Sweden.",didac.gil-de-la-iglesia@lnu.se; jfcalder@ing.puc.cl; danny.weyns@lnu.se; marcelo.milrad@lnu.se; mn@ing.puc.cl,"Nussbaum, Miguel/D-1341-2013; Weyns, Danny/J-1267-2018","Nussbaum, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5983; Weyns, Danny/0000-0002-1162-0817","Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [CIE01-CONICYT]","This work was supported by Center for Research on Educational Policy and Practice, Chile [Grant CIE01-CONICYT].",,45,12,12,1,41,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

In addition, the study tested whether the relationship between ICT use and performance on working memory tasks interacted with seventh-grade students' socioeconomic level and gender. 275 students recruited from 30 Chilean schools were grouped according to their self-reported use of PC, the Internet, Chat and Video games. To assess students' working memory performance, they were tested with a digit span test and a visuo-spatial measure. Only one of our two dependent variables reflected a relationship between specific profiles of ICT use and working memory. Higher scores on the digits span test were related to those user profiles combining PC use and video game play, that is, those identified as Full users and as PC and Console Garners. We did not find an interaction effect of gender and ICT use or an interaction effect of socioeconomic level and ICT use. There are three possible explanations for these results: first, a proclivity of students with higher working memory capacity to engage in technology use; second, an impact on working memory of potential differences in multitasking; and, third, an impact on working memory of video game play. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously since scores on the GEFT, our visuo-spatial working memory measure, were not related to any profile of technology use. As serious educational games become more regularly used at school, previous differences in video game experience become growingly important. Future research must study whether the intended benefits of serious educational games are being mediated by individual differences in previous exposure to video games and other information and computer technologies, with independence of the directionality of the relationship between video game play and working memory.

The design of this kind of game, however, is a complex process that must consider instruction strategies, methodology, usability and ludic aspects. This article's aim is to develop and systematize guidelines for the design of CMPGs. To develop these guidelines we used a three-step process: evaluating an initial implementation of a CMPG and finding its problems; defining guidelines that can help overcome these problems; and redesigning the game based on the guidelines before testing it in a real class scenario to assess how helpful the guidelines were in solving the initial problems. From the initial evaluation of the game, we developed a series of guidelines to overcome the existing problems that can be classified into six categories: On-screen information, Game mechanics, Game progression, Methodology, Collaboration, and Holism. After redesigning the game with these guidelines we performed a field study to see the behavior of the new CMPG, where we measured how well the guidelines were applied in the game-play and the effectiveness in regard to the learning level reached by the students. Our results indicate that the guidelines are a valuable tool in the design of CMPGs that foster learning, which was shown both in the results of the observations and in the significant increase in learning. Although the design guidelines can be seen as general principles, we conclude that they have to be considered differently for different games, and that even during a specific game the importance of each guideline may vary throughout the different quests.

This study examines how experiences with power dynamics in childhood bullying are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety in college. Participants: First-year college students (N = 470) at four universities reported on childhood bullying victimization and power imbalance. Method: Participants completed an online survey in fall 2012 that assessed childhood bullying victimization and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results: Students reporting childhood bullying victimization who indicated they were unable to defend themselves had greater symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who reported victimization but indicated they were able to defend themselves. Qualitative analyses explored why students perceived they could not defend themselves, including factors related to themselves and aggressors. Conclusion: For college students, feeling unable to defend oneself during childhood bullying victimization may be a focus for intervention and help explain diverse college outcomes associated with bullying victimization.","[Oblath, Rachel; Guzman, Javier; Holt, Melissa] Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Counseling Psychol & Appl Human Dev, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Green, Jennifer Greif] Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Teaching & Learning, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Guzman, Javier] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Concepcion, Chile; [Felix, Erika D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Counseling Clin & Sch Psychol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Furlong, Michael J.; Sharkey, Jill] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Int Ctr Sch Based Youth Dev, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Green, JG (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, 2 Silber Way, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",jggreen@bu.edu,"Sharkey, Jill/AAE-7017-2020","Green, Jennifer/0000-0002-3541-4989; Furlong, Michael/0000-0001-5011-4565",,,,51,4,4,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0744-8481,1940-3208,,J AM COLL HEALTH,J.

However, current SLEs have two limitations: (1) not all of these characteristics are included, particularly lacking collaborative knowledge construction, in most cases; and (2) most SLEs are designed to support learning activities outdoors, but not indoors. This paper presents the implementation of an SLE that overcomes these two limitations. This SLE is based on bidirectional Quick Response (QR) codes, which are enhanced QR codes that not only provide information when scanned but also collect usergenerated content. This Bidirectional SLE is evaluated in an experiment in which it is compared with an equivalent Traditional SLE, which is built upon traditional QR codes. The purpose of this comparison is to understand if using bidirectional QR codes as a mechanism to support collaborative knowledge construction in indoor settings has an impact on students' learning outcomes and on their impression of the learning experience. Two hundred fifty-three students participated in this experiment. Data collected from this experiment indicate that the students who worked in the Bidirectional SLE (1) received better scores, providing better and more complete answers, and (2) evaluated their learning experience better than their peers' who worked in the Traditional SLE. Finally, a cross-analysis of these results including teachers' opinions led to a set of lessons learned about the design of SLEs to support collaborative knowledge construction.

We conjectured that these two different emphases could be fruitful combined in a research and development process aimed at producing effective CSCL practices. We explored this possibility in a project that adapted a CSCL tool from Chile to serve as the basis of an effective 3-week classroom module for primary school mathematics in the United States. To go from tool to module, we addressed curricular fit, training materials, pedagogical guidance, formative and summative assessments, and logistical support. In conducting the project, we found that effectiveness and contextual research could be conducted simultaneously and yielded complementary insight to this design process, which enabled our project to rapidly move from the base tool towards complete classroom modules. An experiment we conducted after our design iterations showed that students who used the modules learned more about the target content, fractions. A retrospective analysis of our design process suggests that the Integrative Learning Design framework is useful for organizing the complementary components of effectiveness and contextual research in our design process.

Different theoretical frameworks and assessment instruments have emerged for measuring this skill. However, more applied studies on its implementation and evaluation in real-life educational settings are required. In this sense, pre-post experimental designs are essential for identifying new methods for developing collaborative problem-solving skills. To do so, equivalent tests are needed to facilitate consistent score interpretations and reduce the practice effect. In the present study, a Design-Based Research approach is used to design and validate an assessment tool with two equivalent forms based on a framework proposed by the OECD and applied to a collaborative activity. A total of 719 students aged between 10 and 13 years old participated in the different stages of the study. The results show that the proposed instrument effectively measures the problem-solving dimension of collaborative problem-solving skills among students of this age. Moreover, the results from the test were equivalent for both forms and across genders. Finally, there were no significant differences when assessing collaborative problem-solving in human-human groups versus human-agent groups using the proposed instrument. For future work, we recommend including other data sources than just text-based conversations. This would allow us to capture the rich social interactions present in this type of activity. Future work should also consider exploring the extent to which skills could be trained. This could be done in an experimental design assessed using the equivalent forms of the proposed instrument as a pre- and post-test. Doing so would provide a more accurate measure of students' collaborative skills.","[Rojas, Matias; Nussbaum, Miguel; Guerrero, Orlando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Santiago, Chile; [Greiff, Samuel; Krieger, Florian; Westhuizen, Lindie Van Der] Univ Luxembourg, Cognit Sci & Assessment, 2 Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",,"Rojas, M (corresponding author), Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",mirojas1@uc.cl,,"van der Westhuizen, Lindie/0000-0003-1906-1965; Rojas, Matias/0000-0002-9055-4167; Greiff, Samuel/0000-0003-2900-3734",FONDECYT/CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [FONDECYT 1180024],This work was supported by FONDECYT/CONICYT [FONDECYT 1180024].,,83,1,1,34,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

Data used is from the PISA 2009 test. Special attention is given to potential bias problems when the computer use is an endogenous variable. Few studies in this area address this issue: existing literature has shown that different types of computer use have different implications on performance. The limitations of observational data have also been emphasized to establish cause-effect relations between computer use and academic performance. It is important, however, to consider the computer use endogeneity hypothesis (above all at home) since students decide on the frequency of computer use at home. The results found show that by controlling for endogeneity, computer use for reading is not related to reading performance neither in digital or printed format, with the exception of Chile that shows a negative relation in the case of reading from a printed format. The results considering endogeneity differ considerably from results when endogeneity is not taken into account. The work shows the relevance of experimental type studies in order to make sound statements with regard to the computer use and academic performance relation. In turn, school reading activities in a digital environment are suggested that could have an impact on reading performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants: A sample of 4,710 university students responded anonymously to an online questionnaire. Methods: The risk and protective factors assessed were: specific COVID-related functional difficulties, levels of social support, and trust in the university authorities and the government in handling the crisis. Results: The most frequent COVID-19 related difficulties were: worry for the health of family members (64.4%) and difficulties with online learning (63.2%). Almost half of the students (47.3%) reported that they needed at least a little help. Hierarchical regression analyses for coping and need for help showed that COVID-related difficulties predicted lower levels of perceived coping and a higher need for help. Conclusions: Universities need to build specific services for students to provide concrete support throughout this continuous health crisis.","[Schiff, Miriam; Pat-Horenczyk, Ruth; Benbenishty, Rami] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Paul Baerwald Sch Social Work & Social Welf, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Benbenishty, Rami] Andres Bello Natl Univ, Dept Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Schiff, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Paul Baerwald Sch Social Work & Social Welf, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",Miriam.schiff@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,54,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0744-8481,1940-3208,,J AM COLL HEALTH,J.

In this paper, we present Collboard, a constructivist problem solving activity for fostering the development of specific NMLs in classrooms: collective intelligence, distributed cognition and transmedia navigation. Collboard encompasses successive individual and collaborative work phases that prompt active student participation and engagement. It integrates digitally augmented appliances, namely, digital pens as a means to support individual work, and interactive whiteboards as a collaborative knowledge construction space. We report on the conceptual design of Collboard, its different technological and software components, as well as our findings from experiences we conducted in a Swedish school with 12 students from a 7th grade maths class. Findings from the experience provide an indication that Collboard can be well integrated in classroom teaching, and that it can foster the development of collective intelligence, distributed cognition and transmedia navigation in different knowledge domains.

Disproportionate focus on only some of the features related to this obvious fact has been used to discredit the reliability of scientific knowledge and to relativize its value when compared with knowledge stemming from other sources. This epistemic relativism is widespread nowadays and is arguably dangerous for our collective future, as the threat of climate change and its denialism clearly shows. In this work, we argue that even though the social character of science is indeed real, it does not entail epistemic relativism with respect to scientific knowledge, but quite the opposite, as there are several characteristic behaviours of this specific human community that were built to increase the reliability of scientific outputs. Crucially, we believe that present-day scientific education is lacking in the description and analysis of these particularities of the scientific community as a social group and that further investing in this area could greatly improve the possibilities of critical analysis of the often very technical issues that the citizens and future citizens of our modern societies have to confront.","[Fernandez, Natalia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile; [Benitez, Federico] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Romero-Maltrana, Diego] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Fis, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Fernandez, N (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Avda Univ 330, Valparaiso, Chile.",natalia.fdez.f@gmail.com; federico.benitez.conte@gmail.com; diego.romero@pucv.cl,"Benitez, Federico/I-4333-2013","Benitez, Federico/0000-0001-7978-970X",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso [039.374/2001],"This study was partially funded by Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, Grant No 039.374/2001.",,78,1,1,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

Methods: A total of 963 college students completed self-administered questionnaires that collected information about sociodemographic characteristics, sleep quality characteristics, CMDs, and other lifestyle behaviors. Results: The prevalence of CMDs was 24.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] [21.5%, 27.1%]) among all students. Prevalence estimates of both excessive daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality were higher among females (35.4% and 54.4%) than males (22.0% and 45.8%). Cigarette smoking was statistically significantly and positively associated with having CMDs (p = .034). Excessive daytime sleepiness (odds ratio [OR] = 3.65; 95% CI [2.56, 4.91]) and poor sleep quality (OR = 4.76; 95% CI [3.11, 7.29]) were associated with increased odds of CMDs.

Subsequent to an earlier study of Chilean mothers' attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and adolescent sexual health and education, we conducted a study of fathers' attitudes. Fathers with children aged 9-19 years were recruited at an outpatient clinic in Linares, Chile. Thirty semi-structured face to face interviews were analysed using Grounded Theory methodology. Fathers overall lacked knowledge about HPV and the vaccine. With regards to sex education at home, three salient themes centred on the fathers being part of a 'transition generation.' While fathers expressed positive attitudes towards sex education at home and sought to have more open conversations with their children than they had with their own parents, stereotypical gender roles were barriers to putting these desires into action. Future regional and national sexual health initiatives should engage with gender equity policy change and equip fathers to engage in open, non-judgemental conversation with their children about sex and sexuality.","[Muresianu, Emma Satterthwaite; Weinstock, Rachel E.; Arams, Ryan; Vorawandthanachai, Thammatat; Ferrera, Alexander; Forero, Juan Pablo] Albert Einstein Coll Med AECOM, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Arams, Ryan] Ventura Cty Med Ctr, Family Med Residency, Ventura, CA USA; [Maita, Yumarlin Torres] Univ Autonoma Chile, Hosp Linares, Dept Child & Adolescent Obstet & Gynaecol, Talca, Chile; [Dolan, Siobhan M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Obstet Gynaecol & Reprod Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA",,"Muresianu, ES (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med AECOM, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",esattert@mail.einstein.yu.edu,,"Forero, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-2524-332X",Global Health Fellowship Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Kuperman International Health Endowment Fund at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,Medical student researchers received travel funding to conduct the interviews from The Global Health Fellowship Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and The Kuperman International Health Endowment Fund at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.,,34,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-1811,1472-0825,,SEX EDUC-SEX SOC LEA,Sex Educ.-Sex.

In this article, we propose that these debates are sufficiently interrelated to develop a more unified argument. We will show how a Heideggerian perspective is conceptually rich, in both its heritage, as it draws upon both East-Asian wisdom and western thinking, and its engagement, as it confronts the implications of what Heidegger called a 'technical-era', for offering such a unified critique. The focus of this critique is on instrumental forms of mindfulness (mindfulness 'in' education), which when framed by neoliberalism has rather narrow goals concerning individual well-being and performance. In contrast, more critical and integral forms of mindfulness (mindfulness 'as' education) offer the potential for more holistic and authentic learning. Throughout the article, we discuss how Heideggerian philosophy offers a number of useful concepts (e.g., enframing, Dasein, authenticity, meditative thinking), which are able to both critique the instrumentalisation of approaches like mindfulness by neoliberalism and speak to more holistic education oriented toward more authentic being in the world.","[Brito, Rodrigo; Joseph, Stephen; Sellman, Edward] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Brito, Rodrigo] Univ Mayor, Escuela Psicol, Santiago, Chile",,"Brito, R (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Ctr Res Human Flourishing, Jubilee Campus,7301 Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",rodrigobritopastrana@gmail.com,,"Sellman, Edward/0000-0001-9124-5502",,,,61,2,2,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

The paper presents an operational definition of ICT skills, an instrument measuring these skills as well as the students' results in the test. The definition of ICT skills used considers Chile's curricular framework, functional and cognitive skills. Specifically, ICT skills were defined as the capacity to solve problems of information, communication and knowledge in digital environments. A performance-based assessment was designed in a virtual environment to measure these skills. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of students were able to solve tasks related to the use of information as consumers, i.e., approximately three quarters of the students were able to search for information and half of them were also able to organize and manage digital information. Additionally, they show that very few students were able to succeed in tasks related to the use of information as producers, i.e., only one third of the students were able to develop their own ideas in a digital environment and less than one fifth were able to refine digital information and create a representation in a digital environment. Socioeconomic group, access, daily use and confidence in doing ICT-related activities were all positively associated with higher scores, showing the need to implement strategies to compensate this inequality, possibly by explicitly defining these aims in the national curriculum.

This two-phase study set out to establish the key components, feasibility and acceptability of a group motivational interviewing intervention, focused on alcohol consumption. Methods: In phase 1, focus groups with 12 students and 8 teachers explored issues with existing health education in Wales. Phase 2 involved the development of a 1-hour group motivational interviewing session to address the issues raised. The session was delivered to two classes of students aged 13-15years, facilitated by two motivational interviewing practitioners. Sessions were observed and audio-recorded and coded by two researchers using the Assessment of Motivational Interviewing Groups Observer Scale (AMIGOS). Student acceptability of the session was captured using a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Sessions were consistent with motivational interviewing principles, providing empathic and focused discussion while maximising participants' autonomy and strengths. The majority of students felt listened to during the session, considered it was helpful and felt that they could learn more from this kind of experience. Conclusion: A group motivational interviewing session, developed based on key components identified during focus groups, was shown to be acceptable to students and feasible to deliver in secondary schools. The approach requires further research to establish sustainable delivery mechanisms.","[Hawkins, Jemma L.; Bravo, Paulina; Jerzembek, Gabrielle; Whitehead, Sarah; Murphy, Simon] Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, DECIPHer, 1-3 Museum Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BD, S Glam, Wales; [Bravo, Paulina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Nursing, Santiago, Chile; [Gobat, Nina; Rollnick, Stephen] Cardiff Univ, Cochrane Inst Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Chanon, Sue; Adams, Orla] Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kelson, Mark] Cardiff Univ, South East Wales Trials Unit, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,"Hawkins, JL (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Social Sci, DECIPHer, 1-3 Museum Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BD, S Glam, Wales.",HawkinsJ10@cardiff.ac.uk,"Hawkins, Jemma/A-2417-2012; Kelson, Mark J/E-6753-2016","Hawkins, Jemma/0000-0002-1998-9547; Kelson, Mark J/0000-0001-7744-3780; Gobat, Nina/0000-0002-1558-557X","National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (NISCHR); NISCHR through the Wales School of Primary Care Research [505090]; Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer), a UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Public Health Research Centre of Excellence; British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-590-28-0005]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission; Welsh Government; Wellcome Trust under the UK Clinical Research CollaborationWellcome Trust [WT087640MA]; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/N010078/1, MR/K023233/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MR/N010078/1, MR/K023233/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Phase 1 was supported by the National Institute for Social Care and Health Research (NISCHR) funded Public Health Improvement Research Network.

This supports the theorization of learning as a socio-cultural practice, framed by Vygotsky and developed by other researchers such as Rogoff, Lave and Wenger. However, there is also evidence that working collaboratively may not be a spontaneous response to working in a group, and that teaching learners how to collaborate, and in particular how to work together to negotiate meaning, is a necessary part of the process of learning collaboratively which can enhance outcomes further. A question for the computer supported collaborative learning community then arises as to whether learning to collaborate can be scaffolded through the use of digital tools, and what such tools might look like. This paper reports on the design of a digital system that aims to support the practice of face-to-face collaboration on open-ended tasks. Findings from trials of the system in classrooms in the UK and Chile show that the model is welcomed both by teachers and pupils, and met its objectives of ensuring greater interaction between class members who did not normally work together, and involvement of all individuals in discussion based activities.

Many of those who would have studied in the United States if this decrease had not occurred would have returned home to serve their countries. To estimate the impact of this loss, a survey was conducted in six major cities in Latin America between 1983 and 1989. Selected local medical students interviewed 554 physicians who had returned home after U.S. training and 60 of their classmates who had not trained there. The findings indicate that the returned physicians had given approximately twice as much time to teaching, research, and medical administration as did those who had not left home. The authors maintain that this and related findings show how the curtailment of opportunities for training foreign nationals in the United States is detrimental to both the aspirations of developing nations and the influence of the United States in world affairs.","UNIV PERUANA CAYETANO HEREDIA,LIMA,PERU; CATHOLIC UNIV CHILE,SANTIAGO,CHILE; UNIV FED RIO GRANDE SUL,BR-90000 PORTO ALEGRE,RS,BRAZIL; UNIV NACL PEDRO HENRIQUEZ URENA,SANTO DOMINGO,DOMINICAN REP; UNIV CATOLICA CUENCA,CUENCA,ECUADOR; UNIV JAVERIANA,BOGOTA,COLOMBIA",,"HARRINGTON, WJ (corresponding author), UNIV MIAMI,SCH MED,DEPT INTERNAL MED R36,POB 016760,MIAMI,FL 33101, USA.",,,,,,,6,2,2,0,0,HANLEY & BELFUS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"210 S 13TH ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19107",1040-2446,,,ACAD MED,Acad.

While prior research describes early career researchers' isolation in their institutions, we theorize early career researchers' isolation in their academic fields and reveal how they attempt to mitigate isolation to improve their career prospects. Using a collaborative autoethnographic approach, we generate and analyze a dataset focused on the experiences of 10 early career researchers in a globalizing business academic field known as consumer culture theory. We identify bricolage practices, polycentric governance practices, and integration mechanisms that work to enhance early career researchers' perceptions of agency, and consequently, mitigate their academic isolation. Our findings extend discussions on isolation and its role in new academic careers. Early career researchers, in particular, can benefit from a deeper understanding of practices that can enable them to mitigate isolation and reclaim agency as they engage with global academic fields.","[Belkhir, Meriam] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Brouard, Myriam] HEC Montreal, Mkt, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Brunk, Katja H.] Europa Univ Viadrina, Mkt, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Dalmoro, Marlon] UNIVATES, Lajeado, RS, Brazil; [Ferreira, Marcia Christina] Brunel Univ London, Mkt & Operat, London, England; [Figueiredo, Bernardo] RMIT Univ, Mkt, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Huff, Aimee Dinnin] Oregon State Univ, Mkt, Coll Business, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Scaraboto, Daiane] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Mkt, Santiago, RM, Chile; [Sibai, Olivier] Birkbeck Univ London, Mkt, London, England; [Smith, Andrew N.] Suffolk Univ, Mkt, Sawyer Sch Business, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Belkhir, M (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",,"Ferreira, Marcia Christina/AAQ-1199-2020; Scaraboto, Daiane/AAD-7673-2020","Ferreira, Marcia Christina/0000-0003-2599-8754; Scaraboto, Daiane/0000-0002-7658-9339; Huff, Aimee Dinnin/0000-0002-8261-3411; Dalmoro, Marlon/0000-0002-6211-0905; Amado Figueiredo, Bernardo/0000-0003-1935-4370",,,,131,13,13,2,14,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",1537-260X,,,ACAD MANAG LEARN EDU,Acad.

We developed different rating scales for each and then explored how each scoring method accounts for the students' mathematical/numerical and creative skills. The psychometric properties for both scoring approaches were examined. Each method was shown to reflect different relationships with other performance tests. In addition, it is proposed that MaC may provide useful insight into students' levels of adaptive expertise in mathematics, as reflected by their ability to apply mathematical knowledge (i.e., language, operations, concepts) to novel situations, representing an informative supplement to performance indicators of math achievement.","[Tan, Mei; Mourgues, Catalina; Grigorenko, Elena L.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Mourgues, Catalina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Bolden, David S.] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Grigorenko, Elena L.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Grigorenko, Elena L.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia",,"Grigorenko, EL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, 230 South Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.",elena.grigorenko@yale.edu,"Mourgues, Catalina/T-5811-2019; Grigorenko, Elena/V-2418-2019","Bolden, David/0000-0002-2717-7266",,,,51,7,12,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0175,2162-6057,,J CREATIVE BEHAV,J.

Two settings for national research grant competitions aimed at early-career scientists are introduced, namely the New Zealand Marsden award and the Chilean Fondecyt award. A framework of five constituent moves is formulated and 36 collected grant proposal abstracts are analyzed for their movestructure patterns and accompanying lexico-grammatical signals. A prototypical movestructure pattern is formulated and exemplified with abstracts from both settings and different disciplines, while key variations on this prototypical pattern are also described and analyzed. The findings suggest that a majority of abstracts are near-prototypical in structure (i.e., showing a single variation on a shared prototype) and therefore collectively maintain and reinforce this prototypical pattern as a common reference even as they individually diverge from it for their own rhetorical purposes.

In this journey, there has been considerable progress nationwide in the education of a generation of children in an intercultural socio-educational environment. However, there still exist challenges for ongoing progress towards specific goals, such as bilingualism in children. Bilingual education policies in Chile have focused mainly on 6-13-year-old children, relegating preschool education (0-6 years), one of the most relevant educational levels in the socio-linguistic revival process, to a secondary role. In this context, we examine top-down official policy documents regarding intercultural education in early childhood, developed between 2007 and 2016. Attempting to identify some of the main foci of the language policies that may influence the implementation in preschools, we present an intertextual and critical language policy analysis of these documents used in intercultural and bilingual preschools. In doing so, we compare the consistencies and locate the implicit inconsistencies in the policy positions on bilingual education in preschools. We conclude the article by outlining suggestions for languages policies and teacher education in Chile, and the possible implications for other countries.","[Becerra-Lubies, Rukmini] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile; [Mayo, Simona] Univ Nacl San Martin, Ctr Estudios Lenguaje Soc, San Martin, Argentina; [Fones, Aliza] Univ Iowa, Coll Educ, Iowa City, IA USA",,"Becerra-Lubies, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Campus Villarrica, Villarrica, Chile.",rubecerra@uc.cl,,"Mayo, Simona/0000-0002-1775-6141",Grant CONICYT; Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11160746],This work was supported by the Grant CONICYT and Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT) [grant number 11160746],,58,1,1,8,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-0050,1747-7522,,INT J BILING EDUC BI,Int.

Various types of oral CF are first identified, and the results of research revealing CF frequency across instructional contexts are presented. Research on CF preferences is then reviewed, revealing a tendency for learners to prefer receiving CF more than teachers feel they should provide it. Next, theoretical perspectives in support of CF are presented and some contentious issues addressed related to the role of learner uptake, the role of instruction, and the overall purpose of CF: to initiate the acquisition of new knowledge or to consolidate already acquired knowledge. A brief review of laboratory studies assessing the effects of recasts is then presented before we focus on classroom studies assessing the effects of different types of CF.

This study sought to understand SSWs' views about mental health and trauma in relation to the pandemic and schools reopening. Data came from written responses to open-ended questions on a national survey of SSWs during June-July 2020 (Kelly et al., 2021; Watson et al., 2022). In the national survey, 450 SSWs responded to open-ended questions, providing 115 single-spaced pages of detailed qualitative comments. A unified conceptual model for a trauma-informed school was created by integrating components suggested within the literature. This conceptual model was then used to generate a theory-based coding schema. Responses mapped well onto the conceptual model. Major themes included recognition of COVID-19 and 2020 social unrest as a unique period and potentially traumatic experience; the need for a trauma-informed school response; the challenges of addressing all facets of safety during the pandemic; and the essentiality and difficulty of maintaining school-based relationships during school closures and remote learning. Results demonstrated that SSWs used and discussed key components of a trauma-informed approach. Respondents offered several recommendations for implementing trauma-informed approaches during and after the pandemic, many of which required collaboration from other school staff. Findings provide empirical support for a unified school model that integrates components of a trauma-informed approach found in the literature. We make recommendations for interpersonal, organizational, and policy adaptations schools can take to become more trauma informed.","[Watson, Kate R.] Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Social Welf, 3357 PAB,Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Capp, Gordon] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Social Work, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA; [Astor, Ron Avi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Astor, Ron Avi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Educ & Informat Studies, Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kelly, Michael S.] Loyola Univ, Sch Social Work, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Benbenishty, Rami] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Benbenishty, Rami] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile",,"Watson, KR (corresponding author), Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Social Welf, 3357 PAB,Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",krwats@ucla.edu,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-2625,1866-2633,,SCH MENT HEALTH,School Ment.

This study aimed to evaluate how dental students are using online video content. Materials and Methods Students from eight Universities (Athens, Birmingham, Brescia, Cardiff, Melbourne, Paris, Sao Paulo and Valdivia) representing three continents were invited to complete a survey on their access and learning from online videos. Results International students behave similarly when studying dental content online. Of 515 respondents, 94.6% use the Internet as a learning tool. It was observed that videos are not frequently recommended during didactic lectures (9.6%). But many students (79.9%) will use YouTube for their learning which includes clinical procedures. Students will check online content before performing procedures for the first time (74.8%), to understand what was explained in class (65.9%) or read in books (59.5%), to relearn clinical techniques (64.7%) and to visualise rare procedures (49.8%). More than half of the students do not fully trust the accuracy or the reliability of online content. This does not prevent students from watching and sharing dental videos with classmates (64.4%). The content watched is not shared with teachers (23.3%) even when it contradicts what was learnt in the school (38.2%). Conclusion This study concludes that students regularly integrate open access digital resources into learning portfolios but are hesitant to inform their teachers about their viewing habits. Students wish to receive critical skills on how to evaluate the material they encounter outside their traditional learning space.","[da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias; Pereira, Andresa Costa; Walmsley, Anthony Damien] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias; Pereira, Andresa Costa] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil; [Vital, Sibylle] Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Marino, Rodrigo; Ghanim, Aghareed] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Skelton-Macedo, Mary Caroline] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Kavadella, Argyro; Kakaboura, Afrodite] European Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Univ Austral Chile, Valdivia, Chile; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Uribe, Sergio E.] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Johnson, Ilona] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, Wales; [Dalessandri, Domenico] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy",,"da Silva, MAD (corresponding author), CSTR UFCG Rod,Patos Teixeira S-N, BR-58708110 Patos de Minas, PB, Brazil.",marco.dias@professor.ufcg.edu.br,"da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias/K-4730-2012","da Silva, Marco Antonio Dias/0000-0002-2774-4769; Pereira, Andresa Costa/0000-0002-3654-6123; Marino, Rodrigo/0000-0002-3061-843X; Uribe, Sergio/0000-0003-0684-2025; Skelton-Macedo, Mary Caroline/0000-0002-4189-5088",European UnionEuropean Commission [748609],This manuscript is part of the C2LEARN project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 748609,,38,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1396-5883,1600-0579,,EUR J DENT EDUC,Eur.

Several studies have shown that such victimization exists in multiple contexts and there is considerable variation in prevalence among contexts. This study examined the prevalence of student victimization in public schools by staff members and its relationships with other school-related factors in the context of Kosovo. The sample was designed to represent all students from Grades 6-9 in 13 of Kosovo's 38 municipalities. The sample consisted of 12,040 students from 100 schools, 49.2% of whom were female. They were equally divided between Grades 6 to 9. Overall, more than a quarter of the students reported that a staff member victimized them in the last month. The least prevalent victimization type was sexual-touched or tried to touch you in a sexual manner (2.3%). The most prevalent physical behavior was slapping (15.8%); 12.7% reported being offended or humiliated by a staff member and 8.3% indicated that a staff member cursed them. Boys were victimized significantly more than girls for all types of victimization. The strongest predictors of staff victimization of students were students' involvement in peer-to-peer victimization and risky behaviors, which were correlated with school climate. Future research should examine each type of staff victimization of students (emotional, physical, sexual) separately and test comprehensive models that include multiple predictors, including contextual and school-level variables and staff characteristics.","[Arenliu, Aliriza; Kelmendi, Kaltrina; Duraku, Zamira Hyseni] Univ Prishtina, Fac Philosophy, Dept Psychol, Hasan, Kosovo; [Benbenishty, Rami] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Benbenishty, Rami] Univ Andres Belo, Santiago, Chile; [Konjufca, Jon] Univ Prishtina, Pristina, Albania; [Astor, Ron Avi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Social Welf, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Astor, Ron Avi] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Grad Sch Educ & Informat Studies, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,"Benbenishty, R (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Social Sci, 20 Lila St, Reut, Israel.",ramibenben@gmail.com,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0143-0343,1461-7374,,SCHOOL PSYCHOL INT,Sch.

This methodology is attractive, as it allows institutions to reuse high-quality material developed for MOOCs, while increasing learning flexibility and the students' autonomy. However, the adoption of this methodology is low in general, especially in Engineering courses, as its implementation faces a number of challenges for students. The most salient challenge is the lack of student self-regulatory skills, which may result in frustration and low performance. In this paper, we study how a self-regulatory learning technological scaffold, which provides students with feedback about their activity in the MOOC, affects the engagement and performance of students in an Engineering course following a MOOC-based FC approach. To this end, we design an observational study with the participation of 242 students: 133 students in the experimental group (EG) who used a technological scaffold and 109 in the control group (CG) who did not.

In SDG students work in groups that share one area on a large display screen in front of the class. Each individual student in a group has a mouse and together the students in each group need to perform assignments by using silent collaboration. In the current study, the assignment for the students was to identify and create different kinds of triangles. Outcomes of interest were learning gains (quantitative) and effectiveness of silent collaboration (qualitative). Learning gains were significantly higher for students in the SDG condition than for students following traditional instruction.

We sought to test risk and protective factor assumptions of the IPM using a prospective cohort study with 12months separating baseline from follow-up. Participants were students in grades 8 and 9 in the national Icelandic school system enrolled in the spring of 2018 and 2019 (N=2165). Participants self-reported their experiences of cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use and seven risk and protective factors. Analyses were conducted with generalized linear modeling with extension to general estimating equations with correlated outcomes data. Both individual main-effects models and collective models including all main-effects were tested. Out of 28 individual main-effects models, 23 produced findings consistent with study premises (P<0.05). Multiple main-effects models largely sustained the findings of the individual main-effects models. Findings support the assumption that the risk and protective factors commonly emphasized in the IPM are associated with the four different substance use outcomes in the hypothesized direction. Communities that plan to implement the IPM among adolescents might consider these factors in their work.","[Kristjansson, Alfgeir L.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Kristjansson, Alfgeir L.; Thorisdottir, Ingibjorg E.; Allegrante, John P.; Sigfusson, Jon; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Reykjavik Univ, Lceland Ctr Social Res & Anal, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Lilly, Christa L.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Thorisdottir, Ingibjorg E.; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Reykjavik Univ, Dept Psychol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Allegrante, John P.; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Dept Hlth & Behav Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Allegrante, John P.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Sociomed Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Mann, Michael J.] Boise State Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Dept Community & Environm Hlth, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Soriano, Humberto E.] P Univ Catolica, Div Pediat, Santiago 8330024, RM, Chile",,"Kristjansson, AL (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.; Kristjansson, AL (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Lceland Ctr Social Res & Anal, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",alkristjansson@hsc.wvu.edu,,,European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-CoG-2014-647860]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [2U54GM104942-02],This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) award ERC-CoG-2014-647860 and by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) award 2U54GM104942-02.,,39,2,2,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0268-1153,1465-3648,,HEALTH EDUC RES,Health Educ.

Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills, but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and promote greater cognitive learning. This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and participation experience measures.","[Feng, Zhenan; Gonzalez, Vicente A.] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Amor, Robert] Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lovreglio, Ruggiero] Massey Univ, Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Informat, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Feng, ZA (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",zfen124@aucklanduni.ac.nz,"Lovreglio, Ruggiero/AAH-7275-2019; Amor, Robert/L-9611-2019; Cabrera-Guerrero, Guillermo/AAA-4172-2022; Feng, Zhenan/N-1336-2018","Lovreglio, Ruggiero/0000-0003-4596-7656; Amor, Robert/0000-0002-4329-9044; Feng, Zhenan/0000-0001-7513-8942",,,,68,96,96,24,136,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

SRL is critical in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance, as is commonly the case in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Learners can be trained to engage in SRL and actively supported with prompts and activities. However, effective implementation of learner support systems in MOOCs requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in online behavior. Moreover, identifying learner characteristics that are predictive of weaker SRL skills can advance efforts to provide targeted support without obtrusive survey instruments. We investigated SRL in a sample of 4,831 learners across six MOOCs based on individual records of overall course achievement, interactions with course content, and survey responses. We found that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking was associated with lower goal attainment. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. Several learner characteristics, including demographics and motivation, predicted learners' SRL skills. We discuss implications for theory and the development of learning environments that provide adaptive support. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is still a dearth of research on developing CPS skills among elementary-school students. Our research therefore looks at how elementary school students' regulation skills and emotions are supported by a collaborative game using a collaboration script to scaffold group awareness. An intervention was carried out with a sample of 223 students aged between 10 and 13. The experimental group worked collaboratively in sub-groups, scaffolded by the game, while the control group attended regular lessons. The students' attitudes towards collaboration were evaluated before and after the intervention. In addition to this, a focus group was held a week after the intervention, which involved 32 students from both groups. The quantitative analysis revealed that attitudes towards collaboration improved significantly among students in the experimental group. This difference can be explained by a combination of the intervention, the students' initial attitudes, and their respective GPAs. The qualitative analysis provided evidence of the regulation processes and emotions that emerge when combining a collaboration script with group awareness tools during CPS activities. Furthermore, the results highlighted the relationship between these tools and positive emotions (i.e., satisfaction), co-regulation, and shared regulation. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the co-regulation process required by the game and a shift in emotions from frustration to satisfaction. This work provides evidence of how scaffolding group awareness using a collaboration script supports regulation skills and emotions, thus promoting the development of Collaborative Problem-Solving skills.","[Rojas, Matias; Nussbaum, Miguel; Guerrero, Orlando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile; [Chiuminatto, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Literature & Linguist, Santiago, Chile; [Greiff, Samuel] Univ Luxembourg, Cognit Sci & Assessment, 2,Ave Univ, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Del Rio, Rodrigo] Harvard Univ, Romance Languages & Literatures, Boylston Hall, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Alvares, Danilo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Stat, Santiago, Chile",,"Rojas, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago, Chile.",mirojas1@uc.cl,,,Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico / Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [FONDECYT 1180024],This work was supported by Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico / Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo [FONDECYT 1180024].,,94,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1556-1607,1556-1615,,INT J COMP-SUPP COLL,Int.

The test was applied to a sample of 828 in-service teachers in Chile, together with a characterization questionnaire. Results showed that very few Chilean teachers mastered all the tasks and that only one third were able to provide students with orientations in solving information and communication tasks, revealing that the majority are not playing a mediation role in a digital environment. In relation to explaining variables, science and younger teachers with more years of teaching experience performed better in the test. Nevertheless the low explanation provided by the variables included suggests that variables that have previously accounted for teachers ICT integration are not as good in predicting TIDE capacity. This shows the relevance of developing mixed methods research that together with quantitative data provides qualitative data to help explain this capacity in greater depth.","[Claro, Magdalena; Salinas, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile; [Claro, Magdalena] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Study Educ Policy & Practice CEPPE, Santiago, Chile; [Cabello-Hutt, Tania] Univ N Carolina, Dept Sociol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [San Martin, Ernesto] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Math, Santiago, Chile; [San Martin, Ernesto] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Preiss, David D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Valenzuela, Susana] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, MIDE UC Measurement Ctr, Santiago, Chile; [Jara, Ignacio] Univ Diego Portales, Ctr Polit Comparadas Educ, Santiago, Chile",,"Claro, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Educ, Ave Vicuna Mackenna 4860,Campus San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.",mclarot@uc.cl; asalinase@uc.cl; tjcabell@uc.cl; esanmart@mat.puc.cl; davidpreiss@uc.cl; sfvalenz@uc.cl; ijarav@uc.cl,"Salinas, Alvaro/F-9959-2012; San+Mart’n, Ernesto/AAQ-2374-2021; Preiss, David Daniel/E-6906-2012","Salinas, Alvaro/0000-0001-9655-761X; Preiss, David Daniel/0000-0002-4646-5060; Claro, Magdalena/0000-0002-4974-4380",Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF-CONICYT) [D10I1037],"Research supported by the Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDEF-CONICYT), under the grant D10I1037.",,56,58,66,12,121,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1315,1873-782X,,COMPUT EDUC,Comput.

Methods Ninety-five adolescents with DS (44.2% girls) and a control group of 113 adolescents (47.8% girls), aged between 11 and 18 years old, from the UP & DOWN study were included in this substudy. Serum C-reactive protein, C3 and C4 complement factors, total proteins, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, insulin, cortisol, leptin, adiponectin, galactin-3 and visfatin were analysed; homeostatic model assessment index was calculated. In order to evaluate adiposity, we measured the following body fat variables: weight, height, waist circumference and skinfold thicknesses. Birth weight was obtained by questionnaire. In addition, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body fat percentage (BF%) were calculated. Results Down syndrome group showed higher levels of body mass index, WHtR, waist circumference, BF% and lower birth weight than controls (P < 0.001). In the general linear model in the total sample, WHtR was positively associated with C3 and C4 (P < 0.001) as well as with leptin levels (P = 0.015). BF% was positively associated with total proteins (P = 0.093) and leptin levels (P < 0.001). DS was positively associated with total proteins (P < 0.001), C3 (P = 0.047) and C4 (P = 0.019). Despite the higher levels of adiposity found in DS group, no direct association was found between BF% and leptin levels, comparing with the control group. Conclusions These findings suggest that abdominal obesity should be controlled in adolescents because of its relationship with acute phase-inflammatory biomarkers but especially in DS adolescents who may show a peculiar metabolic status according to their relationship between adiposity and inflammatory biomarkers.","[Gutierrez-Hervas, A.] Univ Alicante, Nursing Dept, Alicante, Spain; [Gutierrez-Hervas, A.; Gomez-Martinez, S.; Marcos, A.] CSIC, Inst Food Sci Technol & Nutr ICTAN, Dept Nutr & Metab DAIN, Madrid, Spain; [Izquierdo-Gomez, R.; Perez-Bey, A.; Castro-Pinero, J.] Univ Cadiz, Fac Educ Sci, Dept Phys Educ, Puerto Real, Spain; [Izquierdo-Gomez, R.] Univ Cent Chile, Fac Educ, Dept Phys Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Veiga, O.

Method The ISRPID was produced through a virtual Delphi group with 37 professionals and relatives of people with ID from four continents and was refined in small pilot groups with persons with ID in Argentina. It has 30 items and can be self-administered or completed by a proxy. Versions in three languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) are available. Following its development, the ISRPID was applied in Chile to 705 persons with ID and to a control group of 524 college students without ID. Results Statistical analysis showed that family relationships, community participation, living arrangements and level of disability affect the experience of rights among people with ID. Importantly, with structured supports, people with ID appear able to exercise their rights to a level comparable to that of their peers without ID. Conclusions With further development, the ISRPID may be an appropriate scale to monitor the exercise of rights contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at an individual or group level.","[Aznar, A.

Reliability of all regression models was high for P-max and V-opt during the leg cycle-ergometer (CVrange: 1.73-2.98%) and for P-max during the bench press throw (CVrange: 4.47-4.73%), while the reliability was acceptable for V-opt during the bench press throw (CVrange: 6.52-7.34%).

Item Response Theory Approach to Differential Item Functioning,educational and psychological measurement,,,English,Article,,,,,,differential item functioning; bias; SAT; item response theory; standardization approach,STANDARDIZATION APPROACH; BIAS; MODEL; SAT,"The relationship between differential item functioning (DIF) and item difficulty on the SAT is such that more difficult items tended to exhibit DIF in favor of the focal group (usually minority groups). These results were reported by Kulick and Hu, and Freedle and have been enthusiastically discussed by more recent literature. Examining the validity of the original reports of this systematic relationship is important so that we can move on to investigating more effectively its causes and the consequences associated to test score use. This article explores the hypothesis that the observed relationship between DIF and item difficulty observed in the SAT could be because of one of the following explanations: (a) the confounding of DIF and impact by the shortcomings of the standardization approach and/or (b) by random guessing. The relationship between DIF and item difficulty is examined using item response theory, which better controls for differences between impact and DIF than the standardization approach and also allows us to test the importance of guessing. The results obtained generally find evidence in support of the relationship between item difficulty and DIF suggesting that the phenomenon reported by earlier research is not a mere artifact of the statistical methodologies used to study DIF.","[Veronica Santelices, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Wilson, Mark] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Santelices, MV (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Hernando de Aguirre 959 Depto 307, Santiago, Chile.",vsanteli@uc.cl,"; Santelices, Maria Veronica/F-3137-2015","WILSON, MARK R./0000-0002-0425-5305; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0003-4062-0047; Santelices, Maria Veronica/0000-0002-9659-8670",UC ACCORD,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by UC ACCORD through a dissertation fellowship.",,56,14,14,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-1644,,,EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS,Educ.

The objective was to ascertain what effects, if any, using the direct or indirect format for the operating activities section of the cash flow statement has, if any, on a loan decision and on the ratings of various attributes of the cash flow statement. Students were pretested on their accounting skills with a few simple calculations, then asked to make the loan decision and finally requested to give their opinion of the financial statements in general and of the statement of cash flows in particular. Format had only a minor effect on the loan decision itself but significantly more favorable comments on user friendliness were received on the direct format than on the indirect. Significant differences were found, however, as regards the loan decisions between the students who had correctly done the calculations and those who had not, to such a degree that the effects of in-numeracy became the main contribution to knowledge of this research. We find that the ability to perform accurate calculations, a fundamental foundation of financial numeracy, has an effect on financial decision making that has been ignored in previous studies of financial statement users and uses. This has significant implications for accounting and investing practice, and opens up an important field of research in accounting which can learn from what has already been studied on the effects of innumeracy in the health management field.","[Donleavy, G.

Many articles have proposed predictive models in order to early detect learners at risk to alleviate this issue. Nevertheless, existing models do not consider complex high-level variables, such as self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, which can have an important effect on learners' success. In addition, predictions are often carried out in instructor-paced MOOCs, where contents are released gradually, but not in self-paced MOOCs, where all materials are available from the beginning and users can enroll at any time. For self-paced MOOCs, existing predictive models are limited in the way they deal with the flexibility offered by the course start date, which is learner dependent. Therefore, they need to be adapted so as to predict with little information short after each learner starts engaging with the MOOC. To solve these issues, this paper contributes with the study of how SRL strategies could be included in predictive models for self-paced MOOCs. Particularly, self-reported and event-based SRL strategies are evaluated and compared to measure their effect for dropout prediction. Also, the paper contributes with a new methodology to analyze self-paced MOOCs when carrying out a temporal analysis to discover how early prediction models can serve to detect learners at risk. Results of this article show that event-based SRL strategies show a very high predictive power, although variables related to learners' interactions with exercises are still the best predictors. That is, event-based SRL strategies can be useful to predict if e.g., variables related to learners' interactions with exercises are not available. Furthermore, results show that this methodology serves to achieve early powerful predictions from about 25 to 33% of the theoretical course duration. The proposed methodology presents a new approach to predict dropouts in self-paced MOOCs, considering complex variables that go beyond the classic trace-data directly captured by the MOOC platforms.","[Manuel Moreno-Marcos, Pedro; Munoz-Merino, Pedro J.; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos; Delgado Kloos, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Av Vicu Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Av 12 Abril & Agustin Cueva, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Tolouse III Paul Sabatier, Route Narbonne, Toulouse, France; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Inst Rech Informat Toulouse, Ave Etudiant, Toulouse, France",,"Moreno-Marcos, PM (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain.",pemoreno@it.uc3m.es; pedmume@it.uc3m.es; jorge.maldonado@ucuenca.edu.ec; mar.perez@uc.cl; calario@it.uc3m.es; cdk@it.uc3m.es,"Marcos, Pedro Manuel Moreno/J-4252-2018; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/C-2876-2011; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/AAC-2052-2019; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/E-1678-2011","Marcos, Pedro Manuel Moreno/0000-0003-0835-1414; Delgado Kloos, Carlos/0000-0003-4093-3705; Alario-Hoyos, Carlos/0000-0002-3082-0814; Munoz-Merino, Pedro/0000-0002-2552-4674; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X","Erasmusthorn Programme of the European Union, through the project LALA [586120-EPP-12017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/project Smartlet [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM [S2018/TCS4307]; European Structural Fund (FSE); European Structural Fund (FEDER); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, under an FPU fellowship [FPU016/00526]; CONICYT/DOCTORADO NACIONAL 2016 [21160081]; Direccion de Investigacion de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido [DIUC_XVIII_2019_54]","This work has been co-funded by the Erasmusthorn Programme of the European Union, through the project LALA (586120-EPP-12017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP), by FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/project Smartlet (TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R), and by the Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM (S2018/TCS4307).

The one digital model that represents a paradigm shift is that of digital fanfiction, in which readers create spinoffs of their favorite books with different media online. Given the need for improvement in reading and writing skills among elementary schoolers, and the research supporting the objective of strengthening the link between reading and writing, the aim of this study is to propose and examine how digital tools may build on the concept of literary interactivity, in particular that of fanfiction, to provide a canvas for co-construction, so that readers may be more directly engaged with the texts they read and, as such, the narratives they build. To this end, we built a tablet-based tool for supporting third graders' incipient literacy learning through a reading-to-writing model that facilitated the multimodal co-construction of a narrative via a gaming mechanism, and maintained users' engagement during a 45-min activity. A design-based approach was used to test and hone the tool in two independent studies, involving a total of 237 third-graders. We learned that gaming mechanisms show promise for supporting narrative construction and for fostering multimodal narrative construction. In a more general sense we learned that interactive, co-constructive tools in a technological format can serve as bridges between elementary schoolers' reading and writing. Our tool in particular additionally fostered fictional storytelling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The identification of the different ways of conceiving, prioritising and implementing these concepts by service providers can help to drive changes to achieve better personal outcomes for this population. The current study aims to identify service providers' perceptions regarding the quality of life of their clients and the quality of services they provide. It also aims to identify similarities and differences of appraisals among professionals, and to identify associations between supports, quality of life and quality of services. Method Data were collected from 22 service providers who attended three focus groups (professionals, direct support staff, and managers) from whom 424 comments were analysed. Service providers were asked about the required support for users, the meaning of quality of life for those users, and about features that should characterise quality services. Thematic analysis was employed and transcripts of the sessions were coded according to the dimensions of models on supports, quality of life and quality of services. Chi-squared tests were utilised to test for potential differences among groups. Results Each professional group has its own priorities concerning required supports. Among the organisation different and potentially conflicting perceptions regarding the meaning of experiencing quality of life coexist. Concerning quality of services, only managers mentioned personal outcomes. Finally, institutionalisation has a negative impact on supports, quality of life and quality of services. Conclusions It is necessary to move beyond a shared awareness of the negative impact of institutionalisation towards the transformation of services in search of personal quality outcomes.","[Jenaro, C.; Flores, N.] Univ Salamanca, Fac Psicol, INICO Inst Univ Integrac Comunidad, Salamanca 37005, Spain; [Vega, V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Pedag, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Cruz, M.] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Enfermeria, San Luis Potosi, Mexico",,"Jenaro, C (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Psicol, INICO Inst Univ Integrac Comunidad, Avda Merced 109-131, Salamanca 37005, Spain.",crisje@usal.es,"Flores, Noelia/H-7492-2013; Jenaro, Cristina/H-6386-2013; Vega Cordova, Vanessa/H-6680-2013","Flores, Noelia/0000-0001-9822-7235; Jenaro, Cristina/0000-0003-2060-1658; Vega Cordova, Vanessa/0000-0003-3333-4798; Perez Rodriguez, Ma. del Carmen/0000-0002-6514-5484",,,,48,6,6,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-2633,1365-2788,,J INTELL DISABIL RES,J.

We aimed to study 1 and 2-year changes in objectively measured physical activity among a relatively large sample of adolescents with Down syndrome. MethodsThis study comprised a total of 99 adolescents with Down syndrome (38 girls) aged from 11 to 20years old at baseline. Participants with valid accelerometer data at baseline and at least one of the follow-up visits were included in the analysis. ResultsOverall, levels of physical activity observed in adolescents with Down syndrome declined from baseline to follow-ups, but these changes were not significant (all P>0.05). Moderate-to-moderately high tracking of physical activity was observed in adolescents with Down syndrome (all P<0.001). Youths who met physical activity guidelines at baseline demonstrated a greater decline in physical activity in 1 and 2-year changes (P<0.05), although they were also more likely to meet physical activity guidelines at 1 and 2-year follow-ups (P<0.05). ConclusionsAdolescents with Down syndrome do not change their levels of physical activity at 2-year follow-ups, but those who met physical activity guidelines presented stronger declines in physical activity over time.","[Izquierdo-Gomez, R.] Univ Cent Chile, Ciencias Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Izquierdo-Gomez, R.; Martinez-Gomez, D.; Esteban-Cornejo, I.; Garcia-Cervantes, L.; Villagra, A.; Veiga, O.

To address the gap of empirical studies integrating individual, social environmental, and cultural factors, we examined how motivational factors and environmental responsiveness were jointly related to college students' creative achievement in different nations. Participants were university students from eight culturally and geographically diverse regions: Argentina, Austria, Chile, China, Kosovo, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Overall, the results painted a generally positive picture of the relationship between environmental responsiveness, motivational factors, and creative achievement. By employing structural equation modeling (SEM) and multiple-group SEM (MGSEM) methods, results partially supported the mediation role of motivational factors between environmental responsiveness and creative achievement. In addition, we observed more consistent relationships between parental responsiveness and motivational factors or creative achievement, than lecturer. This held in common across all seven countries which fulfilled the requirements for the SEM process, indicating that parents play a potential vital role in supporting students' motivational aspects and creative achievements, whereas lecturers supporting role is relative to the cultural organizational circumstances. As the first large-scale empirical study with a socio-cultural approach, we invited further discussion and proposed future cross-cultural research of this kind. Research implications and practical suggestions were addressed.","[Zhang, Zhitian Skylor; Nunez, Miguelina; Ziegler, Albert] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Nurnberg, Bavaria, Germany; [Hoxha, Linda; Arenliu, Aliriza] Univ Prishtina, Prishtina, Kosovo; [Aljughaiman, Abdullah] King Faisal Univ, Al Hufuf, Saudi Arabia; [Gomez-Arizaga, Maria P.] Univ Los Andes, Santiago, Chile; [Gucyeter, Sule] Usak Univ, Usak, Turkey; [Ponomareva, Irina] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Shi, Jiannong] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Irueste, Paula] Natl Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina; [Rogl, Silke] Univ Educ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria",,"Zhang, ZTS (corresponding author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Educ Psychol & Res Excellence, Dutzendteichstr 24, D-90478 Nurnberg, Bavaria, Germany.",zhitian.zhang@fau.de,"Ponomareva, Irina I.

Twenty-three men were tested on two separate sessions. CMJ performance variables were obtained against three external loads (0.5-30-60 kg) using three take-off thresholds: 10 N (arbitrary value of 10 N), 5SD (mean value plus 5 standard deviations of the vertical force recorded during the flight phase), and PRF (peak difference between the vertical force trace and 0 N during the flight phase). No significant differences in reliability were observed between the three thresholds (CV and ICC values of one threshold were within 95% CI of the other thresholds). The magnitude of the variables generally differed between the 10 N threshold and the 5SD and PRF thresholds (P < .05), but not between the 5SD and PRF thresholds (P > .05). These results demonstrate that the take-off threshold influences the magnitude of CMJ performance variables but not their reliability.","[Perez-Castilla, Alejandro; Rojas, F.

Evidence presented demonstrates that none of the components of sensitive responsiveness (i.e., which partner takes the lead, whose point of view is primary, and the turn-taking structure of interactions) or warmth are universal. Mesman and colleagues' proposal that sensitive responsiveness is providing for infant needs is critiqued. Constructs concerning caregiver quality must be embedded within a nexus of cultural logic, including caregiving practices, based on ecologically valid childrearing values and beliefs. Sensitive responsiveness, as defined by Mesman and attachment theorists, is not universal.

To improve support for learners in their self-regulatory processes, researchers have proposed technological solutions to transform recorded MOOC data into actionable knowledge. However, studies providing empirical evidence on how these solutions impact learners' engagement with the course and their self-regulatory behavior remain scarce. In this article, we present the results of an observational case study in which NoteMyProgress (NMP), a web-based tool designed to support learners' self-regulation in MOOCs, is applied as an intervention in two MOOCs. The main aim of this article is to provide insights into how the support of learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies correlates with course engagement. We performed the evaluation using a sample of 263 learners and utilized distinct data sources in order to propose indicators for learners' engagement with the course and NMP. Results show a positive correlation between learners' final grades with NMP functionalities that support goal setting, organization (note taking), and self-reflection (social comparison) SRL strategies. Furthermore, we found no significant behavioral differences in how learners with low SRL and high SRL profiles engage with the course or NMP. Finally, we discuss how these results relate to prior work and the implications for future technological solutions that seek to promote engagement in MOOCs.","[Antonio Perez-Alvarez, Ronald] Univ Costa Rica, Dept Business Comp Sci, Puntarenas 60101, Costa Rica; [Antonio Perez-Alvarez, Ronald; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge; Sapunar-Opazo, Diego; Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge] Univ Cuenca, Comp Sci Dept, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Sharma, Kshitij] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU Alesund, Trondheim Postboks 1517, NO-6025 Alesund, Norway; [Perez-Sanagustin, Mar] Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Inst Recherce Informat Toulouse, F-31000 Toulouse, France",,"Perez-Alvarez, RA (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Dept Business Comp Sci, Puntarenas 60101, Costa Rica.",raperez13@uc.cl; jjmaldonado@uc.cl; kshitij.sharma@ntnu.no; dasapunar@uc.cl; mar.perez-sanagustin@irit.fr,"Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/K-7317-2014","Perez-Sanagustin, Mar/0000-0001-9854-9963; Maldonado-Mahauad, Jorge/0000-0003-1953-390X; Perez Alvarez, Ronald/0000-0002-5544-0770","FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150231]; Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), MOOC-Maker [561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ESEPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; LALA [586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2CBHE-JP]; CONICYT Doctorado Nacional [2017/21170467, 2016/21160081]; Ph.D. Student Fellowships Universidad de Cuenca, Ecuador [007-2015]; Direccion de Investigation de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under the project Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido [DIUC_XVIII_2019_54]","This work was supported in part by FONDECYT under Grant 11150231, in part by the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), MOOC-Maker under Grant 561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ESEPPKA2-CBHE-JP, in part by the LALA under Grant 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2CBHE-JP, in part by the CONICYT Doctorado Nacional 2017/21170467, in part by the CONICYT Doctorado Nacional 2016/21160081, in part by the Ph.D. Student Fellowships Universidad de Cuenca, Ecuador under Grant 007-2015, and in part by Direccion de Investigation de la Universidad de Cuenca (DIUC), Cuenca-Ecuador, under the project Analitica del aprendizaje para el estudio de estrategias de aprendizaje autorregulado en un contexto de aprendizaje hibrido (DIUC_XVIII_2019_54).

Top 16 rankings were obtained for all OLY and WLC competitions between 2011 and 2019. Linear regression and forecasting models were used to examine trends and predictions. A total of 3,061 individual race results were included. For both genders, significant changes were observed in 13 of 14 Olympic events, with most changes highlighting those events have improved (mean: -0.72% (+/- 0.81%) for Men; -0.60% (+/- 0.81%) for Women). For the 2024 predictions, events fall into five groups: improving; declining; converging; diverging; and stable. These results offer insights about trends in times required to be a semi-finalist, finalist, and medalist. This, coupled with the 2024 predictions, may allow high-performance programs to target specific OLY events.","[Crowley, Emmet] Univ Limerick, Sport & Human Performance Res Ctr, Phys Educ & Sport Sci Dept, Limerick, Ireland; [Crowley, Emmet; Ng, Kwok; Powell, Cormac] Univ Limerick, Hlth Res Inst, Phys Act Hlth Cluster, Limerick, Ireland; [Ng, Kwok] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Educ Sci & Psychol, Joensuu, Finland; [Mujika, Inigo] Univ Basque Country, Fac Med & Nursing, Dept Physiol, Leioa, Spain; [Mujika, Inigo] Univ Finis Terrae, Fac Med, Sch Kinesiol, Exercise Sci Lab, Santiago, Chile; [Powell, Cormac] Sport Ireland, High Performance Unit, Sport Ireland Natl Sports Campus, Dublin, Ireland",,"Crowley, E (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Limerick, Ireland.",crowleyperformance@gmail.com,"Ng, Kwok/K-6648-2013","Ng, Kwok/0000-0002-5461-7706; Powell, Cormac/0000-0001-8999-7510",,,,25,0,0,6,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1091-367X,1532-7841,,MEAS PHYS EDUC EXERC,Meas.

Increased distress and mental and medical health concerns are collateral consequences to the disease itself. The Genes to Mental Health (G2MH) Network consortium sought to understand how individuals affected by the rare copy number variations of 22q11.2 deletion and duplication syndrome, associated with neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric conditions, were coping. The article focuses on worry and disruptions in medical care caused by the pandemic. Methods The University of Pennsylvania COVID-19 Stressor List and care disruption questions were circulated by 22 advocacy groups in English and 11 other languages. Results A total of 512 people from 23 countries completed the survey; most were caregivers of affected individuals. Worry about family members acquiring COVID-19 had the highest average endorsed worry, whilst currently having COVID-19 had the lowest rated worry. Total COVID-19 worries were higher in individuals completing the survey towards the end of the study (later pandemic wave); 36% (n = 186) of the sample reported a significant effect on health due to care interruption during the pandemic; 44% of individuals (n = 111) receiving care for their genetic syndrome in a hospital setting reported delaying appointments due to COVID-19 fears; 12% (n = 59) of the sample reported disruptions to treatments; and of those reporting no current disruptions, 59% (n = 269) worried about future disruptions if the pandemic continued. Higher levels of care disruptions were related to higher COVID-19 worries (Ps < 0.005). Minimal differences by respondent type or copy number variation type emerged. Conclusions Widespread medical care disruptions and pandemic-related worries were reported by individuals with 22q11.2 syndrome and their family members. Reported worries were broadly consistent with research results from prior reports in the general population. The long-term effects of COVID-19 worries, interruptions to care and hospital avoidance require further study.","[White, L. K.; Crowley, T. B.; Barzilay, R.; Gur, R. E.; McDonald-McGinn, D.
